She was made to start wearing a hijab at seven years old. Masih is pictured smiling with her brother in a new skirt made by her mother, the tailor for the village‘In 2014, before my campaign was launched, police announced 3.6 million women were either detained and warned or sent to court for \u0027inappropriate hijab\u0027... 40,000 cars were impounded for inappropriate hijab,’ Masih states. Inappropriate hijab can be a headscarf that does not fully cover a woman’s hair or a hijab deemed to be the wrong colour.Every day, she receives dozens of images and videos from women inside Iran who are resisting the veil, which she shares on her Instagram and My Stealthy Freedom Facebook page. And weekly, on a day she has coined \u0027White Wednesdays\u0027, Iranian men and women wear the colour white to support her campaign.  ‘It started off with women sending photos of the back of their unveiled heads, then standing in hills and nature, then walking in public and then with their headscarf being waved on a stick,’ she says, explaining how women have grown bolder in their approach.To understand Masih’s bravery, it pays to look at her background. She was born in a tiny village of just 650 people, called Ghomikola, in Mazandaran, northern Iran, to deeply conservative and religious parents. In her new book, The Wind In My Hair, she describes how money was always tight and her freedom was always restricted.Masih wanted to climb trees and ride bikes like her older brother, Ali, but she was born in 1976, just two years before the Islamic Revolution overthrew 2,500 years of continuous Persian monarchy and stripped women of their freedom.One of the first laws imposed by the new Islamic regime, was the introduction of compulsory hijab in 1983, meaning women must always wear a veil over their hair when they’re in public.           Masih grew up in a religious family in a tiny village in northern Iran. She is pictured here with her grandmother, mother, sister, brother Ali. Masih is seen aged six in a headscarf (far right)Forty years later, Masih is helping women in Iran to ‘take their bodies back’ after they were ‘held hostage by the Islamic Republic of Iran’. She has recruited an army of millions of social media followers to help fight her battle. Masih was jailed at the age of 19. Not because she was unveiled but because she ‘became involved with student activists... we were all teenagers’.It was in a tiny cell, after hours of interrogation, that she found out she was pregnant. Her fiancé, Reza, was also in jail having been arrested first. He had noticed Masih’s periods had stopped and told the guards she was pregnant in the hope it would aid her release.‘We hadn’t had our official wedding party. Getting pregnant before getting married is not acceptable back then, 20 years ago, it was a scandal in my village,’ Masih says.          Masih found out she was pregnant at 19 while locked up in a jail cell. Later, her husband orced her and she lost custody to her son Pouyan. They are pictured here together trying on hats on one of his weekend visits to her house Sex education was non-existent in Iran. Even now, young people are forced to educate themselves about sex via social media. ‘I didn’t know that because my period had stopped it was a sign of getting pregnant…. An interrogator gave me a basket of apples and told me. I was shocked.’Masih was eventually sentenced to five years in prison and 74 lashes. Her sentence was suspended for three years, and Masih went on to marry Reza and give birth to her son Pouyan. But instead of going on to live the traditional, reserved family life the judge had hoped for, Masih’s life was thrown into turmoil when Reza decided to orce her. Iranian law meant it was his choice and he was also award custody of Pouyan, aged four.Masih’s father was ashamed of the orce and wanted her to move home to wait for another husband to come along. Instead, Masih began a career that has taken her from being a fledgling photographer to a parliamentary reporter, broadcaster and now internationally recognised women’s rights activist.Her anti-compulsory hijab campaign began in 2014 when - having received threats to her life and fearing another arrest due to her journalistic work - Masih, aged 33, moved to the UK to study at Oxford Brookes University.  Masih worked as a political reporter in Tehran but was banned from Parliament in 2005. She is pictured on her last day in the Majlis (left), facing MPs angry with her exposes of their corrupt practices          Masih can no longer visit her beloved parents, Zarrin Khanom and Aghajan, in Iran for fear of arrest upon her return. She says her conservative father, who supported the Islamic Revolution, \u0027has been brainwashed several times by the intelligence services\u0027  In her home, near Kew Gardens, she stepped out unveiled into a street lined with cherry blossom. Her partner, Kambiz, took a photo and Masih shared it on her Facebook page. The image, along with her message about how the same act would be illegal in Iran, went viral and began her My Stealthy Freedom Campaign.The cause has grown and grown. One video, shared this week on Masih’s Instagram page, has already had over five million views at the time of writing. It shows men and women in the popular tourist city of Isfahan standing up against the morality police who are trying to arrest a young woman because they believed her hijab is inappropriate.The caption reads: ‘The girl stood up to film them and police took her mobile away. But people supported her by chanting. “Give her mobile back, Leave her alone.” In the end, the police ran away.’Scenes like this are taking place across the country thanks to Masih’s campaign.Shaparak Shajarizadeh, was arrested in February after waving her headscarf from a stick while standing on a traffic island in Tehran (pictured). Masih was relieved when, one week later, Shaparak, who is a mother to a nine-year-old son, told her she would not stop protesting forced hijab          Shima Babaei was one of the first White Wednesday campaigners who answered Masih\u0027s call.  ‘Police used violence against her and her father. I felt so bad… but she sent me a video to share via another person saying “you can’t silence me”,’ Masih says‘The new generation of Iranian women will never ask the government for their rights they just take them. Women are told they can’t sing, but women are singing in Iran. They are told they can’t dance, but they are dancing. They are told they can’t show their, hair but they are doing it... this generation went beyond begging for their rights,’ Masih says.She makes clear she is not against people who want to wear the hijab, she is simply against the law that gives women no choice. ‘Iran should be for both sides, people that love hijab like my mum and sister and people that hate it like me,’ she laughs.                            Women are told they can’t sing, but women are singing in Iran. They are told they can’t dance, but they are dancing. They are told they can’t show their, hair but they are doing it.                         Some critics question whether Masih is putting women in danger from authorities by sharing their images on social media.It’s a question she once grappled with herself. ‘Because of my ‘White Wednesday’ campaign, the authorities announced they arrested 29 women... I was crying loudly in my house in New York and felt guilty,’ she says before explaining how messages from campaigners soon reassured her she was doing the right thing.‘When people tell me I’m putting women in danger it’s nonsense because the Islamic Republic has put women in danger for 40 years,’ she says. ‘They are tired of being humiliated and living in fear.’One brave campaigner, Shaparak Shajarizadeh, was arrested in February after waving her headscarf from a stick while standing on a traffic island in Tehran. Masih was relieved when, one week later, Shaparak, who is a mother to a nine-year-old son, told her she would not stop protesting forced hijab. ‘She told me “every Wednesday I feel useful”... she sent me a photo of herself unveiled in front of the prison after her release.’  ‘These are the Rosa Parks of Iran. They want to be heard. I am here outside of Iran and can help…. Shima was told “your crime is working for Masih” but she told the interrogator “Masih is working for me”.’           When this photo of Masih was taken, next to the stream in her village, she didn\u0027t know it would be the last time she would visit her home           Masih is pictured here with her second husband Kambiz Foroohar, who she now lives with in New York. An Iranian hard-line conservative website posted this picture of them online and labeled her a prostitute for appearing without a hijab Masih recounts a story of the time she went to the seaside fully clothed ‘not even in a burkini, proper clothes’. She went into the sea and was arrested simply for getting wet. ‘We were interrogated for a few hours about why we did it,’ she says incredulously. Police accused her of wanting to get men excited.‘Every day you come out of school and they treat you like a criminal,’ she adds.Fighting against the almighty Iranian regime, without weapons, may seem like an impossible struggle. But Masih, an eternal optimist, believes the battle is already won.‘The government has guns and bullets, state TV and the media. Our people only have their mobile phones but we won the battle. People are breaking through the censorship through social media. You can now see the true face of Iran. No one can ignore us anymore… they can’t say hijab is our culture anymore.’Masih believes there is a fear in the West about standing up against compulsory headscarf laws for fear of being deemed ‘Islamophobic’.‘What makes you Islamophobic is keeping silent about injustices like Sharia law, when you see women suffer and you keep silent that is causing Islamophobia.’           Masih has not seen her son Pouyan (pictured together) for more than a year due to Trump\u0027s travel ban, which has stopped Iranians from travelling to the U.S. At school in Iran, boys are forced to cut their hair to a minimum but when Pouyan moved to Oxford he let his curls grow like his mother          In 2016, the Iranian government allocated $1.7 billion for the protection of hijab - compared to $49 million for the protection of the environment. Masih now lives an unveiled life in New York while fighting for the rights of millions of women back home to choose how to dress Masih now lives with her second husband Kambiz in Brooklyn but she does not have a British, American or Iranian passport. Thanks to President Trump’s travel ban, this means she has not seen her 21-year-old son Pouyan - who is studying in England - for more than a year.‘The travel ban hurts ordinary people like me. It affects students, tourists, and human rights activists,’ she says.Masih is a woman who has endured a lot of pain in her life but it is only when talking about how much she misses Iran that she sounds tearful.‘If I had the chance to be in my own country and have the same voice as I have in America, I would definitely go back because I miss my country…‘But I was disrespected since the age of seven, expelled, jailed and never had the chance to be my true self there. Now I’ve seen my book published, I feel bad when I say Americas is not my home because I am respected here.’The Wind in My Hair: My Fight for Freedom in Modern Iran by Masih Alinejad is out now."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/16/4CFBD67300000578-5814797-image-a-1_1528386839861.jpg","title":"Entire Big Island neighborhood completely covered lava","story":"The neighborhood of Vacationland, located on Hawaii\u0027s Big Island, has been entirely swallowed by lava and nearby Kapoho is facing the same fate, dramatic aerial images reveal. Kapoho Bay, which the neighborhoods used to surround, has also been filled by lava and now juts a mile into the ocean (pictured left on June 3 and right on June 5)An artificially colored image shows the extent of human habitation in red on June 3 (left) and what remained on June 5 after the lava had flowed throughMost of the Kapoho area is now covered in fresh lava as the Kilauea Volcano lower east rift zone eruption continues. County officials said there used to be 279 homes here, but it is unclear how many are now left\u0027The bay is completely filled in and the shoreline is at least 0.8 miles out from its original location,\u0027 said Geological Survey geologist Wendy Stovall. \u0027Vacationland is gone, there is no evidence of any properties there at all. On the northern end of that, there are just a few homes in the (Kapoho) beach lots area.\u0027 Resident Mark Johnson is hopeful that his home on a citrus farm is one of those still standing. His ocean-view property sits on a ridge near the base of Kapoho crater, and he thinks the lava could have missed it.\u0027Basically we are up on that hill, so we\u0027re still OK right now,\u0027 Johnson said.\u0027There\u0027s people shot everywhere\u0027: Las Vegas PD release...Korean backpacker, 25, is winched to safety by a helicopter...Share this articleBut he has resigned himself to the possibility that he could lose his beloved farm, which he can\u0027t access even if lava doesn\u0027t cover it.

This destruction has occurred in the lower east rift area   Aerial image showing the extent of damage inland from the lava flows, which have been pouring into the ocean where they have cooled and created new land   An opening in the Kilauea volcano known as Fissure 8 is seen towards the bottom of this image, which shows how lava has flowed over the countryside and towards the ocean \u0027Over the course of essentially two days, that entire area was covered by lava,\u0027 Stovall said.Molten rock from the erupting Kilauea volcano already has destroyed at least 117 homes in the Lanipuna Gardens and Leilani Estates neighborhoods where lava surfaced more than a month ago. The total number of homes destroyed in the eruption stands at about 400.Scientists are still recording vigorous volcanic activity. While only one crack in the ground is spewing molten rock and the height of fountaining lava has decreased in recent days, \u0027it\u0027s still really impossible to tell,\u0027 when it will end, Stovall said.A magnitude 5.6 earthquake struck the summit of Hawaii\u0027s Kilauea volcano, sending a plume of ash and rock about 10,000 feet (3,048 meters) into the sky Wednesday.The lava inundation is among the most destructive and costly in volcano property loss in U.S. history. While no one has been killed and only one lava-related injury has been reported, the number of destroyed homes dwarfs other recent American eruptions.It comes as a volcano erupted in Guatemala on Sunday and left 99 dead and nearly 200 missing.  A fissure continues to blast fresh lava several hundred feet in the air and flow towards Kapoho as the Kilauea Volcano lower east rift zone eruption continues on Wednesday, June 6  The caldera on the Kilauea Volcano emits a small amount of steam with the lower east rift zone eruption lava access point in Kapoho putting out much more in the distance  This satellite image shows Kilauea summit crater in Hawaii. Lava from the Kilauea volcano destroyed hundreds of homes in a mostly rural area on the Big Island of Hawaii overnightIn Hawaii, previous eruptions have destroyed small towns, but nothing on the scale of this outbreak. Lava flows destroyed homes and other buildings in the same area in 1955 and 1960, but the town of Kapoho was less densely populated at that time.Between 1983 and 2014, a Kilauea eruption razed homes in and around the town of Kalapana. Over the course of about eight months in 1990, 214 homes were destroyed in that area. One home was lost in a separate 2014 lava flow in the commercial hub of Pahoa.Even major explosive eruptions like that of Washington state\u0027s Mount St. Helens in 1980 didn\u0027t result in the same number of homes lost. That volcano and others in the region that have had recent eruptions are very remote with few people living nearby.At Kilauea\u0027s summit, increased earthquake activity has led to explosive eruptions, some of which have shot rock and ash high into the air.\u0027We expect larger explosions will continue at the summit,\u0027 Stovall said Wednesday.Jessica Ferracane, spokeswoman for Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, was on the summit Wednesday and said three \u0027sizable\u0027 earthquakes hit in the two hours she was there.\u0027It\u0027s a beautiful blue day, but it really seems eerie up there, lots and lots of ash covering areas near Jagger Museum and the earthquakes really make things seem very unsettled,\u0027 she said."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/03/4CFF601A00000578-5815011-The_Italian_city_of_Turin_file_pic_is_the_latest_venue_to_host_t-m-2_1528337324983.jpg","title":"Secretive group global elite gather Turin latest Bilderberg Group meeting","story":"    Cardinal Pietro Parolin will meet with 130 carefully selected iniduals at the Bilderberg Group\u0027s latest secret meeting in Turin, Italy          The Italian city of Turin (file pic) is the latest venue to host the secretive meeting          NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg (pictured in Brussels yesterday) is on the guest list          The 95-year-old former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger (pictured) is also on the list of participants NATO chief says splits in the alliance triggered by Donald...You gave Kim Kardashian her wish, now pardon my husband!...EU\u0027s tit-for-tat tariffs against US, including on whiskey...Share this article    The guest list of influential figures includes governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney (pictured)      "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/05/4CFD2B5F00000578-0-image-a-1_1528347588326.jpg","title":"Johnny Depps frail gaunt appearance continues worry fans","story":"    Johnny Depp was spotted looking noticeably pale and thin as he signed autographs for fans after the Berlin leg of his Hollywood Vampire tour on Wednesday          But that couldn\u0027t disguise the Pirates of the Caribbean star\u0027s notably gaunt features  The star had decided to stop to sign autographs for fans at Schnefeld Airport in Berlin, Germany before flying to Sweden for the next stop on the tourHeavily made-up Johnny Depp brushes off health fears as he...What\u0027s eating Johnny Depp?

One claimed that he had to once wipe a \u0027substance\u0027 from the actor\u0027s face in a nightclub. It was also claimed that he spent the day \u0027smoking and drinking\u0027 on the set of City of Lies, formerly known as LAbyrinth, in which Depp plays a LAPD detective investigating the deaths of rappers Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur.             Possible explanation: Depp shaved his head and bleached his eyebrows to reprise his role as Grindewald in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.

You feel that warmth absorbed by the floors and walls when it is desired, and conversely, you feel the cool, cave-like environment providing comfort on hot summer days.\u0027In a world where we often struggle to see beyond the screen of our smart phone or tablet, living in an earthship-style house offers a constant reminder that land and nature is our life-supporting community, one in which we are privileged to be a part of.\u0027          Earthship structures are intended to be \u0027off-the-grid-ready\u0027 homes, with minimal reliance on public utilities and fossil fuels          They are constructed to use available natural resources, especially energy from the sun and rain water"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/12/4D00FEB800000578-5816377-image-a-35_1528369406240.jpg","title":"Ohio cat shares house eight lizards two birds four tortoises","story":"    Not on the menu: Ten-year-old Olive the cat loves to cuddle her 12 scaly housemates - eight lizards and four tortoises          The cat has grown up around exotic bearded dragons. Owner Ali Kirkpatrick, 51, from Wellington, Ohio, says Olive was born without natural feline instincts          \u0027Some of the dragons were a bit apprehensive of Olive when they were babies but they\u0027ve come to realise that she\u0027s just a piece of the furniture now,\u0027 said Ms Kirkpatrick          The relaxed cat also shares an abode with red-footed tortoises Mango and Clementine, Russian tortoises Sadie and Smoky, birds Baloo (above, with Olive) and Bijou and dachshund Sherman, six          Ms Kirkpatrick said: \u0027I have two birds- and Olive just watches them eat.

She didn\u0027t even move to catch it, which is when I first thought she might be OK around Luigi.\u0027When I first introduced them, Olive sized up Luigi but quickly realised how tough his exterior was and she began to use his scales to scratch her face.\u0027She is really drawn to them.

Thank God, this did not happen. Clearly we are dealing with something other than a military agent.\u0027\u0027We would like to be given access to our citizens, to Yulia, and we would like to have the opportunity to take part fully in the investigation.\u0027ON THE PROSPECT OF A THIRD WORLD WAR\u0027The understanding that a third world war could be the end of civilisation should restrain us from taking extreme steps on the international arena that are highly dangerous for modern civilisation.\u0027\u0027The threat of mutual destruction has always restrained participants of the international arena, prevented leading military powers from making hasty moves, and compelled participants to respect each other. U.S. withdrawal from treaties on anti-ballistic missiles is an attempt to put an end to strategic parity, but we will respond to this.\u0027\u0027We believe that the unilateral introduction of all kinds of sanctions does not resolve problems, it only worsens them.\u0027ON SPACE PROGRAM\u0027We need to take many steps forward, including in the quality of our satellites, in the quality of our equipment, and we must return and maintain our competence in launches, there\u0027s a lot of competition in this.\u0027\u0027Overall and in general, we have big and very ambitious plans for the development of our space program. I assure you were will continue down this path. It is no accident that we spent a lot on building a new space base in the east of our country.\u0027ON WEAPONS SYSTEMS\u0027There are weapons being developed, which I have already mentioned: two pieces of hardware with nuclear-powered engines, a global-range missile and an unmanned underwater vessel. In both cases we have completed the main development phase, in particular everything to do with testing the nuclear-powered engineâ¦\u0027\u0027But this is not all we plan to produce and put into service. It\u0027s too early to talk about it but we will do so soon.\u0027          Members of the public have submitted over 1.4 million questions, Russian news agencies reported, many of them visible on a special website set up for the eventON SYRIA\u0027Firstly, the use of our armed forces in the battlefield is a unique experience, a unique tool by which to improve our armed forces. No amount of military exercise could compare with the use of force in combat conditions.\u0027\u0027Yes, we know that the use of force in battlefield conditions is also associated with loss of lifeâ¦ But this was an important, a noble mission, aimed at protecting the interests of the Russian Federation and its citizens.\u0027\u0027Let me remind you that thousands of militants left Russia and the countries of Central Asia â with whom we do not have hard borders â and gathered on Syrian soil. It was better to deal with them there, to get to work there, so to speak, and liquidate them there, than let them come back here, weapons in hand.\u0027\u0027Major military operations, particularly involving Russian armed forces, have ended. There isn\u0027t even a need for them anymore.\u0027\u0027Our soldiers are there (in Syria) in order to secure Russia\u0027s interests in this critically important part of the world, which is so near to us. And they will stay there, for as long as it is in Russia\u0027s interest for them to do so.\u0027\u0027As yet we do not plan to withdraw these forces. But I direct your attention to the fact that I did not call these bases by any other name - I called them bases. We are not building long-term military structures there and if we need to, we could withdraw our military personnel very quickly, without incurring any financial losses.\u0027ON RESTRICTIONS TO RUSSIAN BUSINESS ABROAD\u0027With regards to big business, I spoke about this a few years ago at one of the public meetings with our business leaders. It sounded a bit rude: I warned them that this situation, which we see today, could develop. I warned them about this and recommended at the time that our business keeps its capital in Russia, in the motherland. To keep capital in the place where it was earned and to use it to develop the Russian economy.\u0027\u0027Who is going to help them abroad? They are just persecuted there. Conditions are created making their work impossible. This is a big mistake by those, who are doing this in the West. All these restrictions, all this persecution of our businesses, their difficulties with dollar transactions, it damages the trust businesses from our country and others have in the economic policies of leading global economies. When the United States limits dollar transactions, this damages trust in the dollar.\u0027\u0027In essence, they are sawing the branch on which they are sitting. This is counterproductive and damaging for those involved and for the global economy.\u0027\u0027Some say we need to help Abramovich and other Russian businessmen who have ended up in a difficult situation. I wouldn\u0027t want to speak right now about those people who have broken various laws. I am speaking about people who acquired their capital through legal means. The former and the latter are better off being in Russia.\u0027 ON SANCTIONS\u0027This is a method by which to restrain Russia, the notorious sanctions, because endless accusations lay the groundwork for introducing restraining measures.\u0027\u0027It is because Russia is seen as a threat, because Russia is seen as becoming a competitor. I believe this approach is mistaken. Instead of restraining whoever it would be better to establish constructive cooperation, and then the overall effect on the global economy would be positive.\u0027\u0027It is clear to us that we have to defend our interests, and to do so consistently, not boorishly or rudely, in both the sphere of the economy and of defence. We have done so and we will continue to do so, but we always look for compromises, we aspire towards those compromises. The pressure will end when our partners will be persuaded that the methods they are using are ineffective, counterproductive and harmful to all.\u0027 ON STEEL TARIFFS\u0027The introduction, for example, of restrictive tariffs on steel, on aluminium, not only for Europe but also for Canada and Mexico, in essence these are also sanctionsâ¦ They are related to the pragmatic national interests of the United States.\u0027\u0027We need to work out united and consistently understandable and concrete rules on how to behave in the realm of security and in the realm of economic interaction.\u0027\u0027When in 2007 I spoke in Munich, a speech that is frequently quoted nowadays, I spoke about the fact that the United States is widening the jurisdiction of its laws beyond its national borders, and that this is unacceptable. And that\u0027s exactly what\u0027s happening now, also to our European and other partners. Why is this happening? No one wanted to listen and no one did anything to stop this from developing.\u0027          Critics say the event, which is being held days before Russia hosts the soccer World Cup, is a stage-managed piece of theatre designed to let Russians let off steam and fleetingly feel like they can influence a bureaucratic top-down systemON BALTIC STATES\u0027When it comes to the position of our compatriots in the countries of the Baltic, we are constantly talking about this, bringing it to the attention of the governments of the Baltic states, including Latviaâ¦ The measures that we take to protect the interests of our compatriots must be such that they do not actually worsen their situation.\u0027ON OTHER STATES\u0027 APPROACH TO U.S. SANCTIONS\u0027This is an important part of the negotiation process with the leaders of France, Germany, also with our Austrian friends, where I was visiting just now, and with the representatives of many other European countries, let alone Asia. They don\u0027t just say this privately now, they are talking about this publicly.\u0027\u0027It appears, our partners thought that this would never affect them, this counterproductive politics of restrictions and sanctions. But now we are seeing that this is happening.\u0027ON THE SOCCER WORLD CUP\u0027With regards to the infrastructure, these 11 stadiums. Of course, we spent a lot of money on this and it is imperative that all of this infrastructure, I completely agree, it must work and above all work towards the development of sport on a large scale, including children\u0027s sport.\u0027\u0027I would like right now to address my colleagues in the regions, to ask them to not allow, under any circumstances, for flea markets and the like to appear at these stadiums, as appeared in other sport-related buildings in Moscow during the middle of the 1990s.\u0027\u0027I think our Russian Football Union must play an active part in thisâ¦ and develop a new generation of sportsmen and soccer players.\u0027\u0027Even though our national team has not demonstrated strong results recently, but the number of fans of this beautiful sport here is massive, it\u0027s in the millions. We will rely on the fact that our soccer team will score a big win, so to speak, and will show its best qualities.\u0027ON THE ECONOMY\u0027Overall, we are moving in the right direction. What is the basis for saying this? We have started on the trajectory towards robust economic growth in Russia. Yes, this growth is humble, small, but it is also not a fall. Growth was at 1.5 percent last year.\u0027\u0027Not everyone feels this personally but overall, this is an objective statistic. That\u0027s how it is, it is the truth. Export in technical equipment is growing, which shows that some structural changes are going on in the economy. Export of agricultural produce, at 20 billion last year, was higher than defence exports, which were at 15 billion.\u0027          Putin and his aides say the phone-in is an indispensable tool to gauge public sentiment and learn what people\u0027s real problems areON TAXES\u0027Based on our preliminary calculations, we may in the next six years spend 17 billion roubles, but to achieve the goals that we have discussed, we will need an additional 8 trillion roubles. And it is clear where we are going to find them.\u0027\u0027Firstly, it is through the growth of the economy itself, that\u0027s the main source of additional resources. It is also the more effective use of existing resources, adjustment in some senses of our macro-economic plans and of course adjustments to our tax policy.\u0027\u0027Stability of tax policy must be absolutely guaranteed for the next six years.\u0027\u0027Many suggest changing the personal income tax. We thought about this for a long time. At first glance, progressive personal income tax seems and looks to be fairerâ¦ But reality is more complicated than theories and formulas.\u0027\u0027We had such a tax â a tax on revenue. This is a serious strain on the economy overall and in the end on citizens, because it inevitably leads to a rise in inflation. All this convinced us that introducing this was also not expedient.\u0027ON THE NEW GOVERNMENT\u0027The thing is, the development plan which we have been discussing in recent years, it was being prepared by the previous government during at least the past one and a half years. I know full well that if we were to replace the entire government 100 percent, and bring in totally new peopleâ¦ we would have lost at least two years, and we do not have those two years.\u0027\u0027But it was also necessary to keep those, who made the decisions for our country\u0027s progress. And to personalize responsibility for what has been done so far and for what is coming up soon.\u0027\u0027I think that we have an optimal make up of government for today.\u0027ON GASOLINE PRICES\u0027What is going on right now, it is unacceptable, it is wrong. However, it must be admitted that it is the result of inaccurate regulation, that was brought in recently in the sphere of energy, in energy resources.\u0027\u0027By the autumn of this year, additional measures should be introduced which will stabilize the situation on the market. I am basing this on the fact that the government will be monitoring this carefully.\u0027      "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/12/4CFCA0FD00000578-5816571-image-a-37_1528371476927.jpg","title":"G7 need know G7 Summit G7 countries","story":"    A Canadian mounted police officer walks past the Charlevoix G7 logo ahead of G7 SummitWhat is the G7?The Group of Seven, more commonly known as the G7, is made up of seven of the world’s most richest economies.The G7 countries include Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, making up 62 percent of the world’s net wealth ($280 trillion or £208 tn) and 32 percent of the global purchasing parity GDP.The concept of the G7 was formed before the 1973 oil crisis and two years later, France brought together representatives from the seven countries and these informal meetings started to be held. The European Union has also been a non-enumerated member of the G7 since 1977, but they do not hold a chair or host any summits.          Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron talk during a bilateral meeting at the G7 Summit in 2017What is the G7 Summit?Every year, leaders of all G7 countries meet to discuss important issues that are affecting the world and policy agreements that are made at the G7 Summit ultimately have a trickle-down effect on countries around the world.The location of the G7 Summit changes between the nations that are represented by their member and the leader of the hosting nation hold the G7 Presidency for that ear. It is their responsibility to host and organise the annual event and set the agenda.Where is the G7 being held in 2018?In 2018, the G7 Summit will be held on June 8-9 2018 in Charlevoix, Quebec, Canada with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the G7 President this year.          Leaders of the G7 countries seen here attending a working meeting at the G7 summit in 2015What will be discussed at the G7 2018 Summit?For this year’s G7 Summit, Justin Trudeau has set up ministerial meetings on five topics:1. Advancing gender equality and women’s empowerment2. Investing in growth that works for everyone3. Preparing for jobs of the future4. Working together on climate change, oceans, and clean energy5. Building a more peaceful and secure worldThe first of these goals is even more so poignant after Trudeau referred to himself as a feminist leader and the subject of gender parity is expected to be a dominant theme, across all five discussion topics.Alongside this, with perceptions of the US have fallen after 15 women came forward accusing Trump of sexual harassment, in addition to what was heard on the Access Hollywood tape, Trudeau has set up a Gender Equality Advisory Council.          George W. Bush, John Major and James Baker pictured at the G7 summit, when held in LondonWhat is the Gender Equality Advisory Council?Dayle Haddon, one of the 19 who make up what is being dubbed ‘The Council’, mentioned that private sector accountability and more investment in technology will also be main talking points on both days, according to Notable Life. ‘If you’re not being represented, complete decisions can’t be made.‘In matters such as creating future jobs, we need help designing what that landscape looks like when gender parity is incorporated. If the majority of people working on future-shaping technologies like AI are male, what they are creating will have a male worldview, which only enforces the problem.‘We need growth that works for everyone, and to do that we need to increase girls’ education levels in the technology and AI industries so they have access to these new jobs of the future,’ she said.The aim of the Gender Equality Advisory Council is to call on private sector companies to step up and eradicate this problem and The Council will look to organisations to publicly commit to achieving a gender-neutral board, with equal pay and equal leadership by 2020.‘The leadership qualities that Prime Minister Trudeau is manifesting are extremely impressive. It’s like Canada is standing up,’ Haddon said.Mariah Carey\u0026#8217s All I Want For Christmas UK tour 2018 tickets, dates, venues and scheduleBrexit Secretary David Davis revealed after Theresa May adds 2022 \u0026#8216end date\u0026#8217 to Irish border plan Triple J\u0027s One Night Stand festival 2018: Everything you need to knowBeyonce and Jay-Z tour On The Run II launched in CardiffWhat is Kevin Durant\u0026#8217s net worth?

It was established back in 1954 by Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands.The elite group takes its name from Hotel de Bilderberg in Oosterbeek, the Netherlands, where it held its inaugural meeting on May 29, 1954, at the behest of Prince Bernhard. The group’s initial aim was to revive transatlantic ties between Europe and North America, as the United States and Canada had prospered as Europe, recovering from World War II and faced with the Soviet Union on its doorstep, had seen a rise in anti-American sentiment.The Bilderberg Group’s early leaders deemed its meeting necessary to strengthen North American and European ties as Cold War tensions escalated rapidly.Over the years, the group’s main goal has evolved to promote free market Western capitalism. However, given the powerful nature of attendees and the fact that its secretive annual meetings are held under Chatham House Rules – meaning that participants are free to use any information gleaned to them but are unable to ulge the identity of the person or group who gave it to them – the group has become the subject of many conspiracy theories over the years.When is the Bilderberg Group conference 2018?The Bilderberg Group’s 2018 meeting will take place from June 7 to June 10.Where is the Bilderberg Group conference 2018?The 2018 Bilderberg Conference will be held in Turin, Italy.            IMF director Christine Lagarde has attended the Bilderberg Group meeting in years pastBilderberg Group membersThe Bilderberg Group’s annual meetings have traditionally drawn many of the most influential and powerful political and business leaders from all across North America and Europe.The annual conference is usually attended by roughly 120 to 150 people, with the 2018 meeting slated to include 131 attendees. Just a few of the reported attendees for this year include tech entrepreneur Pete Thiel, King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, Colorado Governor and possible 2020 U.S. presidential candidate John Hickenlooper and many others.Influential political and business leaders who’ve attended in years past include former U.S. President Bill Clinton, businessman and philanthropist Bill Gates and International Monetary Fund director Christine Lagarde.Bilderberg Group conference 2018 agendaThe rise of populism in Europe is at the top of the Bilderberg Group’s 2018 agenda, a development not at all surprising considering the recent success of populist political leaders across the continent and the United Kingdom’s Brexit vote in 2016.Socio-economic inequality, trade, artificial intelligence and the implications of the upcoming 2018 midterm elections in the United States are also high on the powerful group’s agenda for this year.According to the press release, the following items are currently on the meeting’s agenda in order of precedence:1. Populism in Europe2. The inequality challenge3. The future of work4. Artificial intelligence5. The U.S. before midterms6. Free trade7. U.S. world leadership8. Russia9. Quantum computing10. Saudi Arabia and Iran11. The “post-truth” world12.

The airfield was abandoned following the ceasefire of the 1974 war and today stands derelict. Nicosia, the Cypriot capital, was ided into a Greek south and Turkish north area after the brief but devastating war of 1974          Definitely a no-go area: Rolls of sharp barbed wire prevents entry into the main hall inside the decaying Nicosia International Airport. Closed since 1974, Nicosia was the island\u0027s primary airport. It is now abandoned and located in the UN-controlled Buffer Zone which separates the Turkish-occupied north from the south. The airport\u0027s crumbling walls, barbed wire and deserted airfield are a far cry from its heyday, as the gateway to sun-filled holidays in Cyprus          Parts of this plane appear to have been shot at, and scavenged, while the elements have clearly also taken a toll. This picture shows the rusting, discoloured exterior of the fuselage of an Cyprus Airways Trident passenger jet parked on the tarmac of the long-abandoned complex. Nicosia International Airport was used as the island’s principal airport. However it was initially a military air base, and underwent expansion during the Second World War          You\u0027d need more than a mop here: Bird droppings cover nearly every part of the passenger departure area in Nicosia, Cyprus, while in the ceiling above, light fixtures have become rusty because of the lack of maintenance over more than four decades. It\u0027s hard to believe it was once a beacon for holidaymakers, who once flocked to the airport before journeying to and from holiday destinations at stunning resorts nearby. Local wildlife, however, is obviously taking advantage of its abandonment          No passports needed: This office has been boarded up for over 40 years now, with just the sign about the doorway showing its former life as the official border control post. Speaking about the 1974 invasion, Captain Adamos Marneros was flying when he saw Turkish warships approaching the Mediterranean island in an invasion triggered by a coup by Greek Cypriots aiming to unite with Greece.  The pilot recalled he \u0027couldn\u0027t allow myself to be frightened\u0027 because he had to land the plane safely           The former main terminal at Nicosia International Airport stands decaying inside the buffer zone on the southern, Greek side of the ided city in Cyprus. Capt Marneros, who was then a 27-year-old pilot with national carrier Cyprus Airway, said he had deep misgivings about making the flight to Nicosia. After a sleepless night in his London hotel room watching TV reports of the buildup to invasion, he pleaded on three separate occasions with the airline\u0027s boss to cancel the flight - to no avail          Spooky too: The former arrivals hall in the main terminal at the airport also looks bare, with debris covering the floor, while an old sign can be seen with the word \u0027Yes\u0027 to the rear, near passport control. Recalling his flight\u0027s approach to the island in darkness, Capt Marneros saw the hulking silhouettes of warships \u0027creeping\u0027 toward Cypriot shores. His warnings to the airport control tower were met with what he said were halfhearted attempts to ease his concerns          A dilapidated plane, lies abandoned on the tarmac. Capt Marneros was among the last to leave the airport during an evacuation. As he left in his car, he caught sight of Turkish paratroopers just north of the airport drifting down from the skies. \u0027I could see the paratroopers\u0027 eyeballs,\u0027 he said, \u0027and the guns strapped to their gear.\u0027 His aircraft, one of the airline\u0027s four Tridents, was later wheeled to the head of the runway in a bid to prevent Turkish planes from landing. It was promptly blown to bits by Turkish bombs          It\u0027s hard to fathom now, but this hole-strewn hallway in the arrival terminal was once part of a modern, new terminal designed by a German company, which opened on March 27, 1968. The new terminal could accommodate 800 passengers at one time and the parking apron eleven aircraft. Nicosia International Airport now stands thick with dust while old aircraft decay next to the landing strips outside in the largely disused airport located 8.2km west of the Cypriot capital city of Nicosia          Also abandoned, this is the former Nicosia International Airport control tower which has deteriorated dramatically since the the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. Currently, the runways and main airfield facilities are principally under the control of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force (UNFICYP) in Cyprus. The control tower is adjacent to the terminal building and two surviving aircraft, an Avro Shackleton and Hawker Siddeley Trident, which also lie derelict          A sign reading \u0027Tipping porters not allowed\u0027 has somehow remained upright, among rolls of barbed wire below a decades-old advertisement for Seiko watches inside the once state-of-the-art terminal. Once an emblem of the young republic\u0027s growing confidence just 14 years after independence from British colonial rule, the airport overnight became a symbol of a future hijacked by unresolved conflict. The airport was the scene of intense fighting during the invasion in 1974          This would have once been a bustling part of the terminal, where people gathered to grab a bite to eat, at the airport cafe. A bar can still be seen in the background, with a few dilapidated shelves and cupboards. During the invasion, Turkish forces tried to seize the international airport and effectively encircle the capital. Taking heavy losses, the attackers failed amid fierce resistance, prompting United Nations peacekeepers to take it over and declare it a U.N. protected zone          A sad sight: The shell of an airplane, which has been sitting for 44 years at the abandoned Nicosia International Airport in Nicosia, Cyprus. All that remains is the exterior of the plane, as the rest of its key features have been gutted for years. The airport\u0027s grounds remain the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping force on the island and serve as the venue for U.N.-mediated reunification talks. Herders can sometimes be seen moving their goats across the airport tarmac          Debris and bird droppings cover what were once comfortable chairs for those visiting Cyprus, while the floor of the passenger departure area at the former airport is also a mess. Crumbling walls, with ripped cigarette advertisements, can also be seen in the background of Nicosia International Airport. Larnaca International Airport (LCA), a new airport, was opened in the Republic of Cyprus in 1975, after Nicosia\u0027s closure, while Paphos International Airport (PFO) followed in 1983            The former baggage claim hall at Nicosia International Airport stands decaying inside the buffer zone on the southern, Greek side of the ided city on March 7, 2017 in Nicosia, Cyprus. The airport was abandoned following the ceasefire of the 1974 war and today stands derelict. Nicosia, the Cypriotic capital, has been ided into a Greek south and Turkish north ever since the brief but devastating war of 1974. Since then United Nations peacekeepers have maintained a buffer zone          More bird dropping-splattered seats are evident in the departure lounge inside the old Nicosia airport terminal building, now located within the UN-controlled buffer zone that separates the Turkish-occupied north from the south of Cyprus. To mark the International Day of Peace, UNFICYP once organised a Cyprus Peace Concert at the decaying terminal that has been closed since the 1974 Turkish invasion of North Cyprus.

All the pieces are to scale on a 4m x 2.5m diorama representing the actual battlefield of 6km x 4kmHe also gave up work full-time work around the same and decided he had enough figurines to recreate the battle. The 4m x 2.5m diorama representing the actual battlefield of 6km x 4km dominates a loft extension. Mr Wrobel told Kent Live: \u0027My eldest son moved out about five years ago. hat was probably the other catalyst - I finally had a room to do it.\u0027He was very upset,\u0027 Mr Wrobel said in jest, \u0027he can\u0027t come back - he would have to sleep under the table.\u0027 \u0027I would not want my wife to know the total cost,\u0027 Mr Wrobel said, \u0027but it will run into thousands of pounds.          Mr Wrobel spent hours studying what the battlefield at the Battle of Waterloo looked like in order to create the best possible replica of the scene          Mr Wrobel holds up two figurines which are part of his 5,550-strong collection. Mr Wrobel said he had always been interested in military history tactics, which was one of the motivations for finally finishing his impressive display          The level of detail that has gone into finishing this replica of the Battle of Waterloo is second to none.

That\u0027s taken me about five years.\u0027Despite having no background in model making, Mr Wrobel believe his design is the best in its scale.  He said: \u0027I have really gone to a lot of trouble going through old maps and drawings to get it right.\u0027I\u0027m pretty pleased with it in terms of its accuracy.\u0027 Mr Wrobel still has to act out the key moments of the battle and document it in his photobook.He said: \u0027I think that will take me a couple of years, and then when I am done I will do it all again but, but moving all the troops doing what in my view Napoleon should have done.\u0027So I will do my photobooks of what did happen and what might have happened.\u0027He said there are two professional models to rival his own - both in museums.But the scales are different, and while the most famous one at the National Army Museum, made in the nineteenth century, is much bigger, the characters are much smaller and it cannot be used for war gaming in the same way.           Figurines of French and English troops on the battle, as they would have been in 1815.

Then I thought it was the temperature of the water.Former boyfriend of \u0027murdered\u0027 Brazilian woman, 38, found...Hundreds attend \u0027BBQ-ing While Black\u0027 event in support of...Share this article\u0027But I tried all different temperatures - cold, hot, lukewarm and body temperature - but my body reacted to all of them.\u0027She said she was able to rule out chlorine allergy and bacteria in the show head as possible causes for the pain.Ms Farrugia added: \u0027I was still reacting to everything but I didn\u0027t think it could possibly be a water allergy. I\u0027d never heard of such a thing.          Ms Farrugia breaks out in painful hives after coming into contact with water, which last for between 30 and 60 minutes          Despite her painful condition, the young mother still showers but has to make sure another person is in the house in case she goes into anaphylactic shock\u0027The first doctor I saw told me it was impossible but the second doctor I saw had heard of it and referred me to an allergist.\u0027The waiting list on the NHS was five months so I decided to go private.\u0027The outbreak of hives on Ms Farrugia\u0027s body take between 30 minutes and an hour to subside, and has to make sure someone else is in the house with her if she decides to wash as doctors have told her she may go into anaphylactic shock.Ms Farrugia, who is training to become a mental health concillor, said she developed postpartum depression following the birth of Willow, which is likely to have triggered the allergy. She said: \u0027It was horrific and it hit me out of nowhere. I was borderline suicidal.\u0027I couldn\u0027t get out of bed, I couldn\u0027t leave the house, and I was convinced something was going to happen to my daughter. I wouldn\u0027t get anyone hold her.\u0027But I am very fortunate to be super close to my mum and dad and my partner is amazing.\u0027Despite her condition, she still takes regular showers but is quick to monitor her contact with water. Luckily her condition does not affect her internally so she is able to still drink water.  \u0027I have OCD so this condition is a nightmare for me as I always want to be clean. I make sure I dry the water off my skin really quickly.\u0027She believes the condition is more common than the figures suggest and is urging people with similar symptoms to contact their GP immediately.          Ms Farrugia, who is training to become a mental health concillor, said she developed postpartum depression following the birth of Willow, which is likely to have triggered the allergy.

She was made to start wearing a hijab at seven years old. Masih is pictured smiling with her brother in a new skirt made by her mother, the tailor for the village‘In 2014, before my campaign was launched, police announced 3.6 million women were either detained and warned or sent to court for \u0027inappropriate hijab\u0027... 40,000 cars were impounded for inappropriate hijab,’ Masih states. Inappropriate hijab can be a headscarf that does not fully cover a woman’s hair or a hijab deemed to be the wrong colour.Every day, she receives dozens of images and videos from women inside Iran who are resisting the veil, which she shares on her Instagram and My Stealthy Freedom Facebook page. And weekly, on a day she has coined \u0027White Wednesdays\u0027, Iranian men and women wear the colour white to support her campaign.  ‘It started off with women sending photos of the back of their unveiled heads, then standing in hills and nature, then walking in public and then with their headscarf being waved on a stick,’ she says, explaining how women have grown bolder in their approach.To understand Masih’s bravery, it pays to look at her background. She was born in a tiny village of just 650 people, called Ghomikola, in Mazandaran, northern Iran, to deeply conservative and religious parents. In her new book, The Wind In My Hair, she describes how money was always tight and her freedom was always restricted.Masih wanted to climb trees and ride bikes like her older brother, Ali, but she was born in 1976, just two years before the Islamic Revolution overthrew 2,500 years of continuous Persian monarchy and stripped women of their freedom.One of the first laws imposed by the new Islamic regime, was the introduction of compulsory hijab in 1983, meaning women must always wear a veil over their hair when they’re in public.           Masih grew up in a religious family in a tiny village in northern Iran. She is pictured here with her grandmother, mother, sister, brother Ali. Masih is seen aged six in a headscarf (far right)Forty years later, Masih is helping women in Iran to ‘take their bodies back’ after they were ‘held hostage by the Islamic Republic of Iran’. She has recruited an army of millions of social media followers to help fight her battle. Masih was jailed at the age of 19. Not because she was unveiled but because she ‘became involved with student activists... we were all teenagers’.It was in a tiny cell, after hours of interrogation, that she found out she was pregnant. Her fiancé, Reza, was also in jail having been arrested first. He had noticed Masih’s periods had stopped and told the guards she was pregnant in the hope it would aid her release.‘We hadn’t had our official wedding party. Getting pregnant before getting married is not acceptable back then, 20 years ago, it was a scandal in my village,’ Masih says.          Masih found out she was pregnant at 19 while locked up in a jail cell. Later, her husband orced her and she lost custody to her son Pouyan. They are pictured here together trying on hats on one of his weekend visits to her house Sex education was non-existent in Iran. Even now, young people are forced to educate themselves about sex via social media. ‘I didn’t know that because my period had stopped it was a sign of getting pregnant…. An interrogator gave me a basket of apples and told me. I was shocked.’Masih was eventually sentenced to five years in prison and 74 lashes. Her sentence was suspended for three years, and Masih went on to marry Reza and give birth to her son Pouyan. But instead of going on to live the traditional, reserved family life the judge had hoped for, Masih’s life was thrown into turmoil when Reza decided to orce her. Iranian law meant it was his choice and he was also award custody of Pouyan, aged four.Masih’s father was ashamed of the orce and wanted her to move home to wait for another husband to come along. Instead, Masih began a career that has taken her from being a fledgling photographer to a parliamentary reporter, broadcaster and now internationally recognised women’s rights activist.Her anti-compulsory hijab campaign began in 2014 when - having received threats to her life and fearing another arrest due to her journalistic work - Masih, aged 33, moved to the UK to study at Oxford Brookes University.  Masih worked as a political reporter in Tehran but was banned from Parliament in 2005. She is pictured on her last day in the Majlis (left), facing MPs angry with her exposes of their corrupt practices          Masih can no longer visit her beloved parents, Zarrin Khanom and Aghajan, in Iran for fear of arrest upon her return. She says her conservative father, who supported the Islamic Revolution, \u0027has been brainwashed several times by the intelligence services\u0027  In her home, near Kew Gardens, she stepped out unveiled into a street lined with cherry blossom. Her partner, Kambiz, took a photo and Masih shared it on her Facebook page. The image, along with her message about how the same act would be illegal in Iran, went viral and began her My Stealthy Freedom Campaign.The cause has grown and grown. One video, shared this week on Masih’s Instagram page, has already had over five million views at the time of writing. It shows men and women in the popular tourist city of Isfahan standing up against the morality police who are trying to arrest a young woman because they believed her hijab is inappropriate.The caption reads: ‘The girl stood up to film them and police took her mobile away. But people supported her by chanting. “Give her mobile back, Leave her alone.” In the end, the police ran away.’Scenes like this are taking place across the country thanks to Masih’s campaign.Shaparak Shajarizadeh, was arrested in February after waving her headscarf from a stick while standing on a traffic island in Tehran (pictured). Masih was relieved when, one week later, Shaparak, who is a mother to a nine-year-old son, told her she would not stop protesting forced hijab          Shima Babaei was one of the first White Wednesday campaigners who answered Masih\u0027s call.  ‘Police used violence against her and her father. I felt so bad… but she sent me a video to share via another person saying “you can’t silence me”,’ Masih says‘The new generation of Iranian women will never ask the government for their rights they just take them. Women are told they can’t sing, but women are singing in Iran. They are told they can’t dance, but they are dancing. They are told they can’t show their, hair but they are doing it... this generation went beyond begging for their rights,’ Masih says.She makes clear she is not against people who want to wear the hijab, she is simply against the law that gives women no choice. ‘Iran should be for both sides, people that love hijab like my mum and sister and people that hate it like me,’ she laughs.                            Women are told they can’t sing, but women are singing in Iran. They are told they can’t dance, but they are dancing. They are told they can’t show their, hair but they are doing it.                         Some critics question whether Masih is putting women in danger from authorities by sharing their images on social media.It’s a question she once grappled with herself. ‘Because of my ‘White Wednesday’ campaign, the authorities announced they arrested 29 women... I was crying loudly in my house in New York and felt guilty,’ she says before explaining how messages from campaigners soon reassured her she was doing the right thing.‘When people tell me I’m putting women in danger it’s nonsense because the Islamic Republic has put women in danger for 40 years,’ she says. ‘They are tired of being humiliated and living in fear.’One brave campaigner, Shaparak Shajarizadeh, was arrested in February after waving her headscarf from a stick while standing on a traffic island in Tehran. Masih was relieved when, one week later, Shaparak, who is a mother to a nine-year-old son, told her she would not stop protesting forced hijab. ‘She told me “every Wednesday I feel useful”... she sent me a photo of herself unveiled in front of the prison after her release.’  ‘These are the Rosa Parks of Iran. They want to be heard. I am here outside of Iran and can help…. Shima was told “your crime is working for Masih” but she told the interrogator “Masih is working for me”.’           When this photo of Masih was taken, next to the stream in her village, she didn\u0027t know it would be the last time she would visit her home           Masih is pictured here with her second husband Kambiz Foroohar, who she now lives with in New York. An Iranian hard-line conservative website posted this picture of them online and labeled her a prostitute for appearing without a hijab Masih recounts a story of the time she went to the seaside fully clothed ‘not even in a burkini, proper clothes’. She went into the sea and was arrested simply for getting wet. ‘We were interrogated for a few hours about why we did it,’ she says incredulously. Police accused her of wanting to get men excited.‘Every day you come out of school and they treat you like a criminal,’ she adds.Fighting against the almighty Iranian regime, without weapons, may seem like an impossible struggle. But Masih, an eternal optimist, believes the battle is already won.‘The government has guns and bullets, state TV and the media. Our people only have their mobile phones but we won the battle. People are breaking through the censorship through social media. You can now see the true face of Iran. No one can ignore us anymore… they can’t say hijab is our culture anymore.’Masih believes there is a fear in the West about standing up against compulsory headscarf laws for fear of being deemed ‘Islamophobic’.‘What makes you Islamophobic is keeping silent about injustices like Sharia law, when you see women suffer and you keep silent that is causing Islamophobia.’           Masih has not seen her son Pouyan (pictured together) for more than a year due to Trump\u0027s travel ban, which has stopped Iranians from travelling to the U.S. At school in Iran, boys are forced to cut their hair to a minimum but when Pouyan moved to Oxford he let his curls grow like his mother          In 2016, the Iranian government allocated $1.7 billion for the protection of hijab - compared to $49 million for the protection of the environment. Masih now lives an unveiled life in New York while fighting for the rights of millions of women back home to choose how to dress Masih now lives with her second husband Kambiz in Brooklyn but she does not have a British, American or Iranian passport. Thanks to President Trump’s travel ban, this means she has not seen her 21-year-old son Pouyan - who is studying in England - for more than a year.‘The travel ban hurts ordinary people like me. It affects students, tourists, and human rights activists,’ she says.Masih is a woman who has endured a lot of pain in her life but it is only when talking about how much she misses Iran that she sounds tearful.‘If I had the chance to be in my own country and have the same voice as I have in America, I would definitely go back because I miss my country…‘But I was disrespected since the age of seven, expelled, jailed and never had the chance to be my true self there. Now I’ve seen my book published, I feel bad when I say Americas is not my home because I am respected here.’The Wind in My Hair: My Fight for Freedom in Modern Iran by Masih Alinejad is out now."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/03/4CFF601A00000578-5815011-The_Italian_city_of_Turin_file_pic_is_the_latest_venue_to_host_t-m-2_1528337324983.jpg","title":"Secretive group global elite gather Turin latest Bilderberg Group meeting","story":"    Cardinal Pietro Parolin will meet with 130 carefully selected iniduals at the Bilderberg Group\u0027s latest secret meeting in Turin, Italy          The Italian city of Turin (file pic) is the latest venue to host the secretive meeting          NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg (pictured in Brussels yesterday) is on the guest list          The 95-year-old former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger (pictured) is also on the list of participants NATO chief says splits in the alliance triggered by Donald...You gave Kim Kardashian her wish, now pardon my husband!...EU\u0027s tit-for-tat tariffs against US, including on whiskey...Share this article    The guest list of influential figures includes governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney (pictured)      "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/09/4D0068A500000578-0-image-m-72_1528360588762.jpg","title":"Clingy Great Dane grabs hold Thai woman traps headlock","story":"One of the women poses for a cute picture with the large dog standing on its hind legs before it starts licking her face and grabbing hold of herAt the start of the video one of the women, wearing a red top, almost appears to be shaking hands with the dog as she looks towards the camera.The dog seems playful at first as it puts its left paw on her chest and then wraps its head around her neck. The camera pans round to show another dog, also on its hind legs, with its paws round the neck of another bystander in a grey shirt.  Saviours of the Savannah: Anti-poaching rangers reveal...Chain-smoking chimpanzee Jiaku puffs away in a Chinese zoo...Share this articleSoon though the first woman and an onlooker start to look more concerned than delighted as the dog takes a firm grip on her.The clingy pooch, still standing on its hind legs, holds the woman tightly in its arms and seems to wrestle her one way then the other.Another woman holding the dog on a chain comes to her rescue and tries to free her from the pet\u0027s grip, with the help of an older woman who tries to prise her away.           The camera pans round to show another dog, also on its hind legs, with its paws round the neck of another bystander in a grey shirt  The clingy pooch, still standing on its hind legs, holds the woman tightly in its arms and seems to wrestle her one way then the otherWhile the older woman laughs at her predicament the victim of the dog\u0027s headlock seems to have had enough of the Great Dane. Finally, using all her strength, the dog\u0027s owner gives the chain a good yank and releases the struggling woman, who backs well away. Onlooker Jenny Palita said: \u0027I feel sorry for the girl.

Horses are tethered next to caravans on a fog shrowded campsite on the first day of the Appleby Horse Fair. The fair usually welcomes some 10,000 gipsies and travellers as well as 20,000 other people for three days of trade, competition and festivities          Around 10,000 travellers are expected to attend the event who traditionally come to buy and sell horses and it offers an opportunity for the traveller community to come together to celebrate their heritage and culture          Dating back to 1775 - though travellers say it goes back further - the event first became a major date on the gipsy calendar in the 1900\u0027s, where bare knuckle boxing and horse sales, along with an opportunity to mingle with a who\u0027s who of the gipsy community, saw thousands from the UK, Ireland and further afield descend on to Applyby           Can\u0027t wait to meet neighhh-bours: A traditional bow top caravan is driven into the campsite on the first day of the Appleby Horse Fair          One traditional that was stopped last year due to bad weather made it\u0027s return this year, as horses took a dip in the River Eden in order to cool off. The ritual began in the 17th century as a way of washing the horses and making them more presentable for potential buyers          Hold your horses: A young woman rides her horse through the River Eden on the first day of the Appleby Horse fair          Tradesmen hoping to sell and trade their horses wash down the ponies ahead of the fair. Traditionally, the horses bath in the River Eden           He\u0027s a stud: In traveller communities, horses are ridden from a young age, with children taught a hands on approach to raising and caring for the nags. Come Appleby Fair time, it\u0027s common to see men in their teens and early twenties riding, racing and selling horses that they have raised from foals          Women prepare to wash their horses in the River Eden on the opening day of the annual fair. Two sturdy nags ridden by two young men share a word or two before getting their feet (and legs, and bodies!) wet          A girl wearing a black T-shirt and bright red shorts rides her horse out of the River EdenMany of the travellers will arrive on traditional bowtop caravans - also known as vardos - which are traditional, highly decorative wooden wagons  from the British-Romani tradition.  Even possessing a chimney, it is commonly thought of an intricately carved, brightly painted, living wagon for use in the summer months by travelling gipsies.The tradition of the vardo is seen as a high cultural point of both artistic design and a masterpiece of woodcrafters art.The heyday of the living wagon lasted for roughly 70 years, from the mid-1800s through the first two decades of the twentieth century.Not used for year-around living today, they are shown at the Romanichal (British Romani) horse fairs held throughout the year, including Appleby.          Crowds of people gather by the water while others wash their horses in the River Eden as part of tradition           Home is where the cart is: Many of the travellers will arrive on traditional bowtop caravans - also known as vardos - which are traditional, highly decorative wooden wagons from the British-Romani tradition          Shoes off at the door: Even possessing a chimney, it is commonly thought of an intricately carved, brightly painted, living wagon for use in the summer months by travelling gipsies          Wagon wheels: The heyday of the living wagon lasted for roughly 70 years, from the mid-1800s through the first two decades of the twentieth century          Not used for year-around living today, they are shown at the Romanichal (British Romani) horse fairs held throughout the year, including Appleby          Marching orders: While last year proved a rainy and muddy affair, the weather in Cumbria this time around has proved perfect for travellers enjoying a catch up over some beers. One young rider, in his early teens, takes the reins while some older men rehydrate themselves instead          Unruly! One foal frolics in the water while its handler scrubs it down near the water\u0027s edge           Straight from the horses mouth: The mist around this nag\u0027s head can be seen in the early morning air          The town of Appleby, which traditionally has a population of 2,500, comes alive in the early weeks of June. Traditionally the fair runs from Thursday to Wednesday, however the vast majority of the festivities are saved for Friday, Saturday and Sunday           How much is the horsey in the window? People eye up horses and riders pass on Battlebarrow Street in the small Cumbrian town          Horsing around: Horses play a key role in traveller communities and are kept as working animals rather than pets. Despite this, the relationship between them is a unique and is symbolic of the traveller lifestyle. Therefore horse tattoos are seen regularly throughout the fair          Splashing around: People wash horses in the River Eden on the opening day of the annual event          A group of young people look relaxed as they travel on the back of a horse-drawn carriage along Long Marton Road          A boy leads a horse along Long Marton Road after the animal has had a soak in the nearby river as part of the event\u0027s tradition          A boy rides a horse in the centre of Appleby-in-Westmorlan on the day of the fair which attracted crowds of all ages          A man and boy cool off as they pass a caravan while riding a horse along Long Marton RoadThe start of the festival comes after angry motorists were left stuck in a two-mile traffic jam after two travellers with their horses and traditional caravans made their way toward the fair.Dashcam footage captured by a driver in the opposite direction shows the tailback caused by the men, who seemed undisturbed by the snaking traffic in their wake. The two caravans moved along slowly towards the famous fair while more than 100 cars, lorries and vans built up behind them.           A man and girl ride a horse in the centre of Appleby-in-Westmorland surrounded by crowds and other horses which pass by           A boy leads a foal along a footpath adjacent to the River Eden on the opening day of the annual Appleby Horse Fair          Making a splash: A woman rides her horse into the River Eden on the opening day of the Appleby Horse Fair          People sit outside traditional gypsy caravans on the opening day of the annual Appleby Horse Fair which attracts thousands of travellers from across Britain to gather and buy and sell horses          A stunning black stallion is ridden through the water without a saddle by a dare devil traveller          Buck-a-roo: This traveller struggles to stay on his powerful mount as it crashes through the water.

A policeman told us the area was being evacuated,\u0027 he said.\u0027There was a traffic jam because the roads are not built for all the aid vehicles that have come to help.\u0027Authorities raised the death toll from the weekend\u0027s eruption on Tuesday, as rescue teams continued the grim search for the missing.Meanwhile, strong explosions blew ash more than 16,000ft (5,000m) above sea level, with volcanic material blown over settlements to the east and north-east.\u0027We heard the eruption, it sounds a lot like thunder – every time I hear thunder I think \u0027not again\u0027,\u0027 Mr Goldsmith said\u0027The weather has also been a problem, the heavy rain is a concern as mudslides are a risk.

Putin, who won a landslide re-election victory in March, has taken part in the annual phone-in since 2001, using it to cast himself as a decisive troubleshooter on the home front and as a staunch defender of Russia\u0027s interests on the world stageThe 65-year-old politician used the event last year to pledge to eradicate spiralling poverty, fielding almost 70 questions in just under four hours in an event that Kremlin watchers often liken to a tsar listening to his petitioners.  Members of the public have submitted over 1.4 million questions, Russian news agencies reported, many of them visible on a special website set up for the event. Here are some of the highlights from his question and answer session today:ON SERGEI AND YULIA SKRIPAL\u0027If as Britain insists a military chemical agent was used against these people, they would have died within second or minutes, on the spot. Thank God, this did not happen. Clearly we are dealing with something other than a military agent.\u0027\u0027We would like to be given access to our citizens, to Yulia, and we would like to have the opportunity to take part fully in the investigation.\u0027ON THE PROSPECT OF A THIRD WORLD WAR\u0027The understanding that a third world war could be the end of civilisation should restrain us from taking extreme steps on the international arena that are highly dangerous for modern civilisation.\u0027\u0027The threat of mutual destruction has always restrained participants of the international arena, prevented leading military powers from making hasty moves, and compelled participants to respect each other. U.S. withdrawal from treaties on anti-ballistic missiles is an attempt to put an end to strategic parity, but we will respond to this.\u0027\u0027We believe that the unilateral introduction of all kinds of sanctions does not resolve problems, it only worsens them.\u0027ON SPACE PROGRAM\u0027We need to take many steps forward, including in the quality of our satellites, in the quality of our equipment, and we must return and maintain our competence in launches, there\u0027s a lot of competition in this.\u0027\u0027Overall and in general, we have big and very ambitious plans for the development of our space program. I assure you were will continue down this path. It is no accident that we spent a lot on building a new space base in the east of our country.\u0027ON WEAPONS SYSTEMS\u0027There are weapons being developed, which I have already mentioned: two pieces of hardware with nuclear-powered engines, a global-range missile and an unmanned underwater vessel. In both cases we have completed the main development phase, in particular everything to do with testing the nuclear-powered engineâ¦\u0027\u0027But this is not all we plan to produce and put into service. It\u0027s too early to talk about it but we will do so soon.\u0027          Members of the public have submitted over 1.4 million questions, Russian news agencies reported, many of them visible on a special website set up for the eventON SYRIA\u0027Firstly, the use of our armed forces in the battlefield is a unique experience, a unique tool by which to improve our armed forces. No amount of military exercise could compare with the use of force in combat conditions.\u0027\u0027Yes, we know that the use of force in battlefield conditions is also associated with loss of lifeâ¦ But this was an important, a noble mission, aimed at protecting the interests of the Russian Federation and its citizens.\u0027\u0027Let me remind you that thousands of militants left Russia and the countries of Central Asia â with whom we do not have hard borders â and gathered on Syrian soil. It was better to deal with them there, to get to work there, so to speak, and liquidate them there, than let them come back here, weapons in hand.\u0027\u0027Major military operations, particularly involving Russian armed forces, have ended. There isn\u0027t even a need for them anymore.\u0027\u0027Our soldiers are there (in Syria) in order to secure Russia\u0027s interests in this critically important part of the world, which is so near to us. And they will stay there, for as long as it is in Russia\u0027s interest for them to do so.\u0027\u0027As yet we do not plan to withdraw these forces. But I direct your attention to the fact that I did not call these bases by any other name - I called them bases. We are not building long-term military structures there and if we need to, we could withdraw our military personnel very quickly, without incurring any financial losses.\u0027ON RESTRICTIONS TO RUSSIAN BUSINESS ABROAD\u0027With regards to big business, I spoke about this a few years ago at one of the public meetings with our business leaders. It sounded a bit rude: I warned them that this situation, which we see today, could develop. I warned them about this and recommended at the time that our business keeps its capital in Russia, in the motherland. To keep capital in the place where it was earned and to use it to develop the Russian economy.\u0027\u0027Who is going to help them abroad? They are just persecuted there. Conditions are created making their work impossible. This is a big mistake by those, who are doing this in the West. All these restrictions, all this persecution of our businesses, their difficulties with dollar transactions, it damages the trust businesses from our country and others have in the economic policies of leading global economies. When the United States limits dollar transactions, this damages trust in the dollar.\u0027\u0027In essence, they are sawing the branch on which they are sitting. This is counterproductive and damaging for those involved and for the global economy.\u0027\u0027Some say we need to help Abramovich and other Russian businessmen who have ended up in a difficult situation. I wouldn\u0027t want to speak right now about those people who have broken various laws. I am speaking about people who acquired their capital through legal means. The former and the latter are better off being in Russia.\u0027 ON SANCTIONS\u0027This is a method by which to restrain Russia, the notorious sanctions, because endless accusations lay the groundwork for introducing restraining measures.\u0027\u0027It is because Russia is seen as a threat, because Russia is seen as becoming a competitor. I believe this approach is mistaken. Instead of restraining whoever it would be better to establish constructive cooperation, and then the overall effect on the global economy would be positive.\u0027\u0027It is clear to us that we have to defend our interests, and to do so consistently, not boorishly or rudely, in both the sphere of the economy and of defence. We have done so and we will continue to do so, but we always look for compromises, we aspire towards those compromises. The pressure will end when our partners will be persuaded that the methods they are using are ineffective, counterproductive and harmful to all.\u0027 ON STEEL TARIFFS\u0027The introduction, for example, of restrictive tariffs on steel, on aluminium, not only for Europe but also for Canada and Mexico, in essence these are also sanctionsâ¦ They are related to the pragmatic national interests of the United States.\u0027\u0027We need to work out united and consistently understandable and concrete rules on how to behave in the realm of security and in the realm of economic interaction.\u0027\u0027When in 2007 I spoke in Munich, a speech that is frequently quoted nowadays, I spoke about the fact that the United States is widening the jurisdiction of its laws beyond its national borders, and that this is unacceptable. And that\u0027s exactly what\u0027s happening now, also to our European and other partners. Why is this happening? No one wanted to listen and no one did anything to stop this from developing.\u0027          Critics say the event, which is being held days before Russia hosts the soccer World Cup, is a stage-managed piece of theatre designed to let Russians let off steam and fleetingly feel like they can influence a bureaucratic top-down systemON BALTIC STATES\u0027When it comes to the position of our compatriots in the countries of the Baltic, we are constantly talking about this, bringing it to the attention of the governments of the Baltic states, including Latviaâ¦ The measures that we take to protect the interests of our compatriots must be such that they do not actually worsen their situation.\u0027ON OTHER STATES\u0027 APPROACH TO U.S. SANCTIONS\u0027This is an important part of the negotiation process with the leaders of France, Germany, also with our Austrian friends, where I was visiting just now, and with the representatives of many other European countries, let alone Asia. They don\u0027t just say this privately now, they are talking about this publicly.\u0027\u0027It appears, our partners thought that this would never affect them, this counterproductive politics of restrictions and sanctions. But now we are seeing that this is happening.\u0027ON THE SOCCER WORLD CUP\u0027With regards to the infrastructure, these 11 stadiums. Of course, we spent a lot of money on this and it is imperative that all of this infrastructure, I completely agree, it must work and above all work towards the development of sport on a large scale, including children\u0027s sport.\u0027\u0027I would like right now to address my colleagues in the regions, to ask them to not allow, under any circumstances, for flea markets and the like to appear at these stadiums, as appeared in other sport-related buildings in Moscow during the middle of the 1990s.\u0027\u0027I think our Russian Football Union must play an active part in thisâ¦ and develop a new generation of sportsmen and soccer players.\u0027\u0027Even though our national team has not demonstrated strong results recently, but the number of fans of this beautiful sport here is massive, it\u0027s in the millions. We will rely on the fact that our soccer team will score a big win, so to speak, and will show its best qualities.\u0027ON THE ECONOMY\u0027Overall, we are moving in the right direction. What is the basis for saying this? We have started on the trajectory towards robust economic growth in Russia. Yes, this growth is humble, small, but it is also not a fall. Growth was at 1.5 percent last year.\u0027\u0027Not everyone feels this personally but overall, this is an objective statistic. That\u0027s how it is, it is the truth. Export in technical equipment is growing, which shows that some structural changes are going on in the economy. Export of agricultural produce, at 20 billion last year, was higher than defence exports, which were at 15 billion.\u0027          Putin and his aides say the phone-in is an indispensable tool to gauge public sentiment and learn what people\u0027s real problems areON TAXES\u0027Based on our preliminary calculations, we may in the next six years spend 17 billion roubles, but to achieve the goals that we have discussed, we will need an additional 8 trillion roubles. And it is clear where we are going to find them.\u0027\u0027Firstly, it is through the growth of the economy itself, that\u0027s the main source of additional resources. It is also the more effective use of existing resources, adjustment in some senses of our macro-economic plans and of course adjustments to our tax policy.\u0027\u0027Stability of tax policy must be absolutely guaranteed for the next six years.\u0027\u0027Many suggest changing the personal income tax. We thought about this for a long time. At first glance, progressive personal income tax seems and looks to be fairerâ¦ But reality is more complicated than theories and formulas.\u0027\u0027We had such a tax â a tax on revenue. This is a serious strain on the economy overall and in the end on citizens, because it inevitably leads to a rise in inflation. All this convinced us that introducing this was also not expedient.\u0027ON THE NEW GOVERNMENT\u0027The thing is, the development plan which we have been discussing in recent years, it was being prepared by the previous government during at least the past one and a half years. I know full well that if we were to replace the entire government 100 percent, and bring in totally new peopleâ¦ we would have lost at least two years, and we do not have those two years.\u0027\u0027But it was also necessary to keep those, who made the decisions for our country\u0027s progress. And to personalize responsibility for what has been done so far and for what is coming up soon.\u0027\u0027I think that we have an optimal make up of government for today.\u0027ON GASOLINE PRICES\u0027What is going on right now, it is unacceptable, it is wrong. However, it must be admitted that it is the result of inaccurate regulation, that was brought in recently in the sphere of energy, in energy resources.\u0027\u0027By the autumn of this year, additional measures should be introduced which will stabilize the situation on the market. I am basing this on the fact that the government will be monitoring this carefully.\u0027      "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/14/4D02533800000578-5816691-Joyce_Qiu_pictured_was_on_exchange_when_she_was_attacked_with_th-a-3_1528378662210.jpg","title":"Australian student exchange London horrified man urinated festival moshpit","story":"    An Australian student was left horrified after a man \u0027urinated\u0027 (pictured) on her while they were in a festival moshpit in London           Joyce Qiu (pictured) was on exchange when she was attacked with the vile act during a Lorde performance which left her standing in a puddle of urine which soaked her socks\u0027After feeling a warm liquid start to pour over the backs of my legs, I realised that the guy behind me was peeing on me,\u0027 Ms Qiu wrote online.The perpetrator allegedly relieved himself all over the back of the young woman and into her boots as he \u0027splashed his pee\u0027 onto people surrounding them. \u0027My socks were then squelchy with his urine as we stood in the moshpit that was very tight,\u0027 she explained. \u0027I am left repulsed and completely disgusted by such an act, not to mention how harassed and degraded I feel.\u0027They made me cry...

The airfield was abandoned following the ceasefire of the 1974 war and today stands derelict. Nicosia, the Cypriot capital, was ided into a Greek south and Turkish north area after the brief but devastating war of 1974          Definitely a no-go area: Rolls of sharp barbed wire prevents entry into the main hall inside the decaying Nicosia International Airport. Closed since 1974, Nicosia was the island\u0027s primary airport. It is now abandoned and located in the UN-controlled Buffer Zone which separates the Turkish-occupied north from the south. The airport\u0027s crumbling walls, barbed wire and deserted airfield are a far cry from its heyday, as the gateway to sun-filled holidays in Cyprus          Parts of this plane appear to have been shot at, and scavenged, while the elements have clearly also taken a toll. This picture shows the rusting, discoloured exterior of the fuselage of an Cyprus Airways Trident passenger jet parked on the tarmac of the long-abandoned complex. Nicosia International Airport was used as the island’s principal airport. However it was initially a military air base, and underwent expansion during the Second World War          You\u0027d need more than a mop here: Bird droppings cover nearly every part of the passenger departure area in Nicosia, Cyprus, while in the ceiling above, light fixtures have become rusty because of the lack of maintenance over more than four decades. It\u0027s hard to believe it was once a beacon for holidaymakers, who once flocked to the airport before journeying to and from holiday destinations at stunning resorts nearby. Local wildlife, however, is obviously taking advantage of its abandonment          No passports needed: This office has been boarded up for over 40 years now, with just the sign about the doorway showing its former life as the official border control post. Speaking about the 1974 invasion, Captain Adamos Marneros was flying when he saw Turkish warships approaching the Mediterranean island in an invasion triggered by a coup by Greek Cypriots aiming to unite with Greece.  The pilot recalled he \u0027couldn\u0027t allow myself to be frightened\u0027 because he had to land the plane safely           The former main terminal at Nicosia International Airport stands decaying inside the buffer zone on the southern, Greek side of the ided city in Cyprus. Capt Marneros, who was then a 27-year-old pilot with national carrier Cyprus Airway, said he had deep misgivings about making the flight to Nicosia. After a sleepless night in his London hotel room watching TV reports of the buildup to invasion, he pleaded on three separate occasions with the airline\u0027s boss to cancel the flight - to no avail          Spooky too: The former arrivals hall in the main terminal at the airport also looks bare, with debris covering the floor, while an old sign can be seen with the word \u0027Yes\u0027 to the rear, near passport control. Recalling his flight\u0027s approach to the island in darkness, Capt Marneros saw the hulking silhouettes of warships \u0027creeping\u0027 toward Cypriot shores. His warnings to the airport control tower were met with what he said were halfhearted attempts to ease his concerns          A dilapidated plane, lies abandoned on the tarmac. Capt Marneros was among the last to leave the airport during an evacuation. As he left in his car, he caught sight of Turkish paratroopers just north of the airport drifting down from the skies. \u0027I could see the paratroopers\u0027 eyeballs,\u0027 he said, \u0027and the guns strapped to their gear.\u0027 His aircraft, one of the airline\u0027s four Tridents, was later wheeled to the head of the runway in a bid to prevent Turkish planes from landing. It was promptly blown to bits by Turkish bombs          It\u0027s hard to fathom now, but this hole-strewn hallway in the arrival terminal was once part of a modern, new terminal designed by a German company, which opened on March 27, 1968. The new terminal could accommodate 800 passengers at one time and the parking apron eleven aircraft. Nicosia International Airport now stands thick with dust while old aircraft decay next to the landing strips outside in the largely disused airport located 8.2km west of the Cypriot capital city of Nicosia          Also abandoned, this is the former Nicosia International Airport control tower which has deteriorated dramatically since the the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. Currently, the runways and main airfield facilities are principally under the control of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force (UNFICYP) in Cyprus. The control tower is adjacent to the terminal building and two surviving aircraft, an Avro Shackleton and Hawker Siddeley Trident, which also lie derelict          A sign reading \u0027Tipping porters not allowed\u0027 has somehow remained upright, among rolls of barbed wire below a decades-old advertisement for Seiko watches inside the once state-of-the-art terminal. Once an emblem of the young republic\u0027s growing confidence just 14 years after independence from British colonial rule, the airport overnight became a symbol of a future hijacked by unresolved conflict. The airport was the scene of intense fighting during the invasion in 1974          This would have once been a bustling part of the terminal, where people gathered to grab a bite to eat, at the airport cafe. A bar can still be seen in the background, with a few dilapidated shelves and cupboards. During the invasion, Turkish forces tried to seize the international airport and effectively encircle the capital. Taking heavy losses, the attackers failed amid fierce resistance, prompting United Nations peacekeepers to take it over and declare it a U.N. protected zone          A sad sight: The shell of an airplane, which has been sitting for 44 years at the abandoned Nicosia International Airport in Nicosia, Cyprus. All that remains is the exterior of the plane, as the rest of its key features have been gutted for years. The airport\u0027s grounds remain the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping force on the island and serve as the venue for U.N.-mediated reunification talks. Herders can sometimes be seen moving their goats across the airport tarmac          Debris and bird droppings cover what were once comfortable chairs for those visiting Cyprus, while the floor of the passenger departure area at the former airport is also a mess. Crumbling walls, with ripped cigarette advertisements, can also be seen in the background of Nicosia International Airport. Larnaca International Airport (LCA), a new airport, was opened in the Republic of Cyprus in 1975, after Nicosia\u0027s closure, while Paphos International Airport (PFO) followed in 1983            The former baggage claim hall at Nicosia International Airport stands decaying inside the buffer zone on the southern, Greek side of the ided city on March 7, 2017 in Nicosia, Cyprus. The airport was abandoned following the ceasefire of the 1974 war and today stands derelict. Nicosia, the Cypriotic capital, has been ided into a Greek south and Turkish north ever since the brief but devastating war of 1974. Since then United Nations peacekeepers have maintained a buffer zone          More bird dropping-splattered seats are evident in the departure lounge inside the old Nicosia airport terminal building, now located within the UN-controlled buffer zone that separates the Turkish-occupied north from the south of Cyprus. To mark the International Day of Peace, UNFICYP once organised a Cyprus Peace Concert at the decaying terminal that has been closed since the 1974 Turkish invasion of North Cyprus. Reunification talks crashed at a Swiss summit last summer  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/18/4D01624900000578-5817865-Footage_shows_the_vulnerable_beast_walk_across_a_fallen_tree_and-m-21_1528390946007.jpg","title":"Orangutan defends forest grabbing digger","story":"    This is the harrowing moment an orangutan tries to defend its forest by grabbing at a digger          Footage shows the vulnerable beast walk across a fallen tree and lean towards the heavy machineryThe orangutan tries to grab on to the digger as it is lifted into the air but falls before it can latch onto the vehicle.A man, who is a member of the Orangutan Protection Unit for the International Animal Rescue non-profit organisation, can be seen in the video creeping under the animal with a dart gun.He successfully captures the creature and then moves it to safety.

As many as 6,000 jobs could be lost - 2,000 direct HoF employees and 4,000 who work for in-store concessions.The move by the 169-year-old company is part of a rescue plan that will also lead to House of Fraser moving out of its head offices in London and Glasgow and closing a distribution centre in Milton Keynes where more than 400 more jobs are under threat.Up to 5,000 more jobs are at risk at the 355-store Poundworld chain which on Thursday gave notice that it intends to appoint administrators. The legal process provides court protection from creditors for 10 days while the company attempts to mount a last-ditch rescue. However, even if a buyer comes forward at the 11th hour, they would be expected to close down a large part of the store estate.Poundworld’s private equity owner TPG Capital is understood to be unwilling to pump more cash into the business. TPG said a key reason for Poundworld’s problems was the Brexit blow to sterling, which pushed up the cost of imported goods. The two chains’ difficulties come after a string of retailers and restaurant groups, including Mothercare, Carpetright, New Look, Prezzo and Jamie’s Italian, have announced plans to close hundreds of outlets putting more than 35,000 jobs on the block so far this year. DIY chain Homebase is also expected to close about 60 stores after a £1 rescue takeover by restructuring specialist Hilco which will be completed this month.House of Fraser traces its origins back to 1849, when Hugh Fraser and James Arthur opened a drapery shop on the corner of Argyle Street and Buchanan Street in the centre of Glasgow. By 1941, it had expanded into a number of shops in Scotland and became House of Fraser.The 1950s marked a period of major expansion for House of Fraser. In 1953, still owned by the Fraser family, the group extended its geographic reach across Scotland and into north-east England and Carlisle with the purchase of the Binns chain, which had its origins in an early 19th century Sunderland drapery business. Harrods, the luxury London department store, and Dickins \u0026amp Jones, became part of the House of Fraser group in the late 1950s.Growth continued in the 1970s, with the addition of well-known names such as Rackhams, the Army \u0026amp Navy stores and Dingles.Change came in 1985 when the House of Fraser group was bought by the Al Fayed family for £615m and a new business strategy was announced, with plans to replace smaller branches with larger stores.In 1994 House of Fraser was floated on the London Stock Exchange at a market value of £484m, with Harrods split off and kept under private ownership by Al Fayed.A takeover bid from Scottish retail entrepreneur Tom Hunter was rejected in 2003 and some branches in Scotland were sold or closed.However, two years later the group was in expansion mode again, buying 16 stores under the Jenners and Beatties brands became part of the group in 2005. Large new store openings followed in 2008 at locations including Belfast, Bristol and the Westfield shopping centre in west London.In 2013, House of Fraser opened its first store overseas, in Abu Dhabi’s World Trade Center shopping mall.House of Fraser was bought by China’s Nanjing Xinjiekou Department Store Co – also known as Nanjing Cenbest – in 2014. Angela MonaghanAlex Williamson, House of Fraser’s chief executive, said that without the proposed store closures the business was likely to collapse.“A decision to close this number of stores is not done lightly. This is really grim,” Williamson said. “It is a highly emotional, highly regrettable situation that none of us either imagined or wanted to see happen, but there is simply no alternative.”Outside the Oxford Street store, which has been trading since 1879, Jeanne Bateman from Norwich said: “I’m a big high street shopper. I’m very sad to see so many big high street names closing down. I feel sorry for us the shopper, and very sorry for the people who work here.” Her daughter, Catherine Wilamowska, agreed, but added that because she lives in a small village she does all her shopping online. Wilamowska’s habits reflect a changing world in which about a fifth of all UK retail spending has moved on to the internet. While online specialists such as Amazon, Boohoo and Asos continue to expand rapidly, traditional retailers are struggling to adapt as many are stuck in now unprofitable stores on long and expensive leases. Switching to selling online also requires heavy investment in IT and delivery networks at a time when cost prices have risen as a result in fall of the value of the pound. Many retailers are also facing big increases in business rates, together with higher labour costs as a result of the national minimum wage and apprenticeship levy. At the same time shoppers have reined back spending on clothing and household goods because of a squeeze on spare cash and a shift to renting rather than owning homes.The House of Fraser chairman, Frank Slevin, said: “The retail industry is undergoing fundamental change and House of Fraser urgently needs to adapt to this fast-changing landscape in order to give it a future and allow it to thrive.”In a presentation to investors, the company admitted it had made mistakes with its website and by cutting back on in-house womenswear brands, but it also blamed Brexit and the fall in the value of the pound for pushing up costs for retailers. Dave Gill, national officer at the shopworkers’ union Usdaw, said: “This is devastating news for House of Fraser employees. We are receiving calls from loyal and long-serving staff who are extremely worried, including those who work in brand concessions and are not directly employed by House of Fraser.”He added that although HoF does not recognise Usdaw, he had asked the retailer “to engage in urgent talks, so that we can challenge the business case, investigate what can be done to save jobs and represent our members’ best interests”.The restructuring and closures are a condition of a deal that will give control of House of Fraser to the Chinese C.banner business, which also owns Hamleys.It is feared House of Fraser could struggle to complete the CVA, as landlords and lenders have expressed concerns about a lack of consultation and fears that C.banner will not be able to inject sufficient cash into the business to turn it around.Williamson said management had been forced to take brave decisions, including closing some of its most high-profile stores, to try to ensure the business had a future. “There are too many case studies of CVAs that have not worked, and this is not going to be one of them,” he said.C.banner has committed to putting £70m into House of Fraser after the restructure which Williamson said would help turn it around.The company has also put another £1m into its pension fund after discussions with trustees, who expressed concerns about protection for savers in the restructure. On Thursday, landlords called for an urgent government review of the rising use of CVAs, which they say risks undermining the UK’s reputation and deters investment in town centres.The British Property Federation said it believed the process was being misused.Melanie Leech, the chief executive of the landlords’ group, said: “The CVA process is intended to be part of a comprehensive business recovery plan. “Property owners, looking after savers’ and pensioners’ money, will support businesses who demonstrate this commitment, but must protect those pensioners against unfair action that penalises their interests.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0602adc3bb1f3cf5fb9a7ca9d3b9add0ac4ea53/0_67_2407_1444/master/2407.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0049589f139287781b8989cbec2ba63e","title":"paul dacre gone daily mail next associated newspapers","story":"Like all bullies, he targets underdogs – and those may soon include his successor at the paperAsked for the winning formula of his Daily Mail, Lord Northcliffe replied: “I give my readers a daily hate.” No one has kept that flame burning more brightly than Paul Dacre, poisoner of the national psyche, bully-in-chief, whose iron whim has terrified prime ministers for a quarter of a century, and who has announced he will be stepping down as the paper’s editor in November.Like all bullies he targets underdogs, imposing on the country racism, homophobia and philistinism, and shunning complexity and evidence. His sheer bully-power often frames the national debate by warping broadcasters’ news agendas, because they know the Mail makes politicians quake. Theresa May – his candidate – caves in to him every time, as paralysed on paying for social care as on Brexit. His legacy is the great Brexit ide that has torn the country in two.Decades of straight-banana EU fabrications and myths sowed the seeds, but nothing was as shocking as his front pages in the referendum run-up, filled with dark-skinned migrants making bogus claims, criminals and terrorists heading this way.Dacre defenders point to his championing of the murdered Stephen Lawrence – son of Dacre’s decorator – as if one case wipes clean the regular racist filth.With no compass as to where the true middle lies – it’s around £27,000 – his own £2.5m salary plus £1.4m bonus may skew his understanding. So may his Scottish estate, where activities include deer-stalking and grouse shooting, and his Sussex cattle farm, for which he draws bundles in EU agricultural subsidy.His political modus operandi is to go for the jugular, to play the person, not the ball. So when Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, expressed her members’ alarm at how a hard Brexit might kill their businesses, Dacre’s Mail did her over – and her family – in a savage double-page spread.It works: industrialists dare not put their head above the Brexit parapet for fear of the Mail lopping it off. When Gina Miller bravely went to the high court to secure parliament’s right to a Brexit say, he found no actual dirt, but called her “a gloating Guyana-born investment manager who alternates between glorying in self-promotion and complaining that her safety is under threat”. Thanks to Mail nastiness, she – like Stella Creasy and other Dacred women – faces death threats.Why do people – especially women – read it? There is a gobsmacking fascination with his outrageous headlines: how far will he go? Women are a favoured target, the Mail acting as playground bitch, forever papping celebrities putting on weight, spotted without makeup, revealing cellulite in a bikini. The case of the Royal Navy’s Faye Turney was a classic: after she was captured by the Iranians, the Mail joined the chequebook stampede for her story, offering – according to the defence department – “a very substantial sum”. But when she told her story elsewhere, Dacre took revenge, savaging her as an unfit mother: a picture of soldiers’ coffins bore the headline, “They won’t be selling their stories.”As editor-in-chief and chair of the Associated Newspapers board, his hot, fiery breath and sweary bollockings may bear down on his successor. As he reputedly frightens his proprietor, Lord Rothermere, Dacre may be the one to appoint an editor in his own image, just as he followed the moralising tics and toxic politics of his predecessor, David English.Optimists hope the sheer democracy-threatening anarchism of his recent assaults on the supreme court as “enemies of the people” has finally stirred Rothermere to rid us of this mania. The obvious replacement is the Mail on Sunday editor, Geordie Greig, friend of the Rothermeres and well-liked in moderate Tory circles. But long-term enmity between Dacre and Greig has exploded into print with the MoS’s robust remainer stance landing like an Exocet into the heart of Dacre’s daily.Who else? Mentioned is George Osborne, the London Evening Standard editor: Mail-hard on austerity, but like Greig sharing none of Dacre’s retro social conservatism. At least one cloud would be lifted: Dacre’s nostalgic miasma of an imagined 1950s in the days before orce, career women, single mothers, perverts and ethnic minorities caused our mortal moral decline."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43177a3c284ec6a1511e867e2fee9aa41faaaba7/0_0_650_393/master/650.jpg?w=940\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=17c69dca6cf942bb13de62d1bf552d1f 1880w","title":"economics and medicine graduates are top earners finds report","story":"Salary uplift of some degrees in UK exceeds that gained from private education, says studyStudents studying economics and medicine at British universities are likely to gain the largest financial benefits from their degrees, outstripping even the considerable advantages enjoyed by private school students or people from the wealthiest backgrounds, a study has found.An Institute for Fiscal Studies report, using several years of evidence gathered from education and taxation data, showed the higher pay for graduates in a small group of subjects remained even after adjusting for student background and school type.“Average graduate earnings are around £26,000 to £30,000 five years after graduation, and so these differences could amount to earnings differentials of more than £10,000 a year. If these persist over the life cycle, this could represent a significant difference in lifetime income,” the IFS noted.Sam Gyimah, the higher education minister, said the results had “far-reaching ramifications” for the debate on higher education funding.“The clutch of underperforming degrees is a problem for students – it is likely they include many of the courses whose students feel they are not getting value for money,” Gyimah told a Higher Education Policy Institute conference.“They are also a problem for the taxpayer, since courses where students tend not to earn graduate salaries after graduation account for a disproportionate share of the costs to the public purse of the student loans system.“And they are a problem for the reputation of the sector. They are the inconvenient kernel of truth underlying critiques of mass higher education.”Jack Britton, a senior research economist at the IFS and an author of the report, said: “Family background has an important impact on graduates’ future earnings, but subject and institution choice can be even more important.Graduates who had earlier gained an A* in GCSE maths earned considerably more than those who obtained As or Bs.Seven years after graduation, men with A*s in GCSE maths were earning £48,000 on average, while those with As were on £39,000 – but graduates who failed to gain a C were earning less than £26,000. For women, those with A*s averaged more than £40,000, with £33,000 for As.The authors cautioned that some of the high returns offered by certain degrees or institutions may be the result of other factors that are difficult to measure.“They may reflect differences in unobservable characteristics between different student bodies if, for example, some courses are more likely to take students with better socioemotional skills or greater preferences for work,” the research noted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e10c5648ef1ec7c68e6372a015b1a2eaede54bad/540_0_3262_1958/master/3262.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9cf0e57656b06708316284c1905df23e","title":"european cinema embraces the vagina whats taken hollywood so long","story":"Vulva and vagina references are becoming obligatory in US comedies. But for fearless, witty depictions of women’s bodies, audiences have always had to look elsewhereThese days, it seems no raunchy femme-centric Hollywood comedy or TV sitcom is without its obligatory vagina reference. “I was just washing my vagina,” they say or, “I’m gonna punch her in the vagina.” The word “vagina” is bandied about as though we are expected to fall about laughing at the very idea of it. And maybe I would laugh, if only I weren’t more bemused than amused by the perplexing way “vagina” appears to have expanded to embrace not just the vagina itself, but the vulva and the female pubic area in general.But Hollywood, as ever, is all talk. In an industry run by overgrown schoolboys, breasts remain the primary female erogenous zone. Despite the pioneering work of Sharon Stone crossing her legs in Basic Instinct (1992), visible vulva is, unsurprisingly, a rarity in mainstream cinema, possibly because it’s not considered as titillating as big bazoomas.Perhaps this is for the best, though, since the last thing we need are gross-out comedies in which women’s nether regions get the same treatment as testicles: Ben Stiller’s caught in his zip in There’s Something About Mary (1998) or Will Poulter’s grotesquely inflamed by a spider bite in We’re the Millers (2013). “Closeups make us anxious about things,” Jean-Luc Godard once said, and he had a point.Lad-com producer and director Judd Apatow, having already discovered the comic potential of gratuitous todger in Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008) and the criminally underrated Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story (2007), inserted a closeup of a baby being squeezed out of a real vagina in Knocked Up (2007), but one suspects this was more in a quest for male adolescent yucks than an attempt to even things up.For the real money shots, as usual, we must look to the Europeans, whose fearlessness in the gynaecological sector rivals men’s top-shelf magazines in their pre-Pornhub heyday. The French film-maker Catherine Breillat, for example, out-Apatows Apatow with an explicit cervical examination and birth sequence in Romance (1999). Then, in Anatomy of Hell (2004), she got porn actor-director Rocco Siffredi (AKA “the Italian Stallion”) to apply lipstick to the labia and anus of his leading lady’s vulva double, though in both films the characters’ tendency to earnestly debate gender politics undercuts potential shock value, let alone any hint of eroticism (which is presumably the intention). Meanwhile, her compatriot François Ozon’s preposterous but delicious thriller L’Amant Double (2017), kicks off its daft plot with a speculum’s-eye view of the female protagonist’s internal couloir: about as sexy as a smear test, but a witty invitation into its heroine’s psyche.The Eisenstein of the arty obstetric shot is Gaspar Noé, who in Enter the Void (2009) and Love (2015) inserts trippy, semi-abstract imagery of penises penetrating vaginas, shot from the vaginal perspective in glorious red and orange with sporadic strobe effectx. Typically, Lars von Trier is more mean-spirited with his full-on frontal scenes in Antichrist (2009), where Charlotte Gainsbourg no sooner exposes her lady parts than she’s snipping away at them with scissors.More lyrically, The Invader (2011) by Belgian director Nicolas Provost, begins with a medium closeup of a pudendum posed like Gustave Courbet’s 1866 painting L’Origine du Monde, followed by a two-minute Steadicam shot of its serene white owner getting to her feet and strolling across a nudist beach towards the sea – where half-drowned African migrants are being washed up on the shore.Presenting the case for more playful vaginal action, albeit in a film that elsewhere features stalking and rape, Pedro Almodóvar’s adorable pastiche of a silent-movie dream sequence in Talk to Her (2002) shows a tiny man shedding his vest and pants to crawl inside a gigantic simulacrum of his lover’s vagina, which looms over him like a dirigible fringed in AstroTurf. More bonkers still is Ken Russell’s Lisztomania (1975) in which Roger Daltrey, dressed in a purple crinoline, gets sucked into an outsize replica of Sara Kestleman’s gusset before re-emerging with an eight-foot erection. But this is merely a prelude to a Busby Berkeley-esque musical number in which his former mistresses commandeer his phallus for a maypole dance before chopping off the glans with a guillotine. Vagina for the win! And to think Russell was never offered a knighthood.L’Amant Double is in UK cinemas now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c42f4d663d9c5a8248467a075188c44d0850b94/74_0_2643_1586/master/2643.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7971083910804b17a9395bae8a3619c","title":"peter bradshaw scariest films ever hereditary","story":"Occult chiller Hereditary is the latest in a proud line of big-screen blood-curdlers. Our critic picks his 25 most terrifyingNow that Lars von Trier has offered what may be a backhanded homage to it in his serial-killer nightmare The House That Jack Built, attention may well refocus on this cult giallo classic from Italy. A journalist investigates a series of murders in a remote village and uncovers black-magic practices.Once upon a time, Bret Easton Ellis’s novel American Psycho was the most shocking thing in American publishing. Mary Harron’s movie version did not excite the same disgust, but it made Christian Bale into a star as the gym-built Wall Street master of the universe and status snob who is also a serial killer.A classic crude slasher from Tobe Hooper, in my view better than The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Four teenagers become trapped inside a haunted ride at a carnival and find themselves being picked off by the disfigured killer inside. Hooper weaponises his own fiendish bad taste with some truly grisly killing scenes.The explosion of digital movie-making 20 years ago – and the sudden availability of digital cameras at high-street prices – liberated film-makers and gave birth to the “found footage” genre. This is a movie whose cheeky viral marketing allowed people to think it was a genuine documentary. Three students hike into a forest, intending to make a supercilious video-diary history project about the local tradition of the “Blair Witch”. They are never seen again and this footage is all that is recovered.George A Romero invented the zombie genre with this smart, low-budget shocker about a virus, accidentally brought back to Earth from outer space, that causes people to eat each other, afflicted by an eternal hunger. It satirised racism, conformism, careerism and the country’s secret fear of the future.Ari Aster has barnstormed his way into the scary hall of fame with this deeply strange movie featuring Toni Collette as an artist and miniaturist who is haunted in every sense by her late mother, an abusive and manipulative woman who now wishes to gain control of her grandchildren from beyond the grave.A brilliant horror inspired by MR James’s story Casting the Runes. After sleeping with someone, a young woman discovers she has been inducted into a supernatural death cult she is being followed by a demonic figure that only she can see and which pursues her on foot at a zombie pace, but will eventually kill her – unless she has sex with someone else, at which point this demon’s target will change. And so it goes on: a viral chain-letter of sex and shame.An almost unclassifiable masterpiece of J-horror and one of the very few movies in the genre in which the demonically violent protagonist is allowed to be a woman, satirising women’s position in Japanese society and cinema. A film producer hits upon the idea for getting a wife: he will audition actresses for a (nonexistent) minor role and then, having found a suitably submissive woman, let her down and ask her for a date. The auditionee (Eihi Shiina) turns the tables on his arrogance with extreme violence.One of the great horror thrillers of contemporary US cinema and a brilliant allegory for the plot twist of the US post-Obama. An African American photographer (Daniel Kaluuya) is invited by his white girlfriend (Allison Williams) to spend the weekend with her super-liberal parents.One of the great movies about vampires, which Abel Ferrara reimagines as a parasitical cult of addiction, a pyramid scheme for spreading evil. Lili Taylor plays a lonely student in New York who is bitten and must then bite. Her agony in confronting her unwished-for destiny of eternal undeadness is brilliant.A masked attacker has escaped from a secure facility. It is the loathsome Michael, who has one of the most disturbing walks in film history: lumbering and laborious, and yet inexorable in his pursuit of Jamie Lee Curtis. The pioneering use of electronic music is part of what makes Halloween memorable: the plinking piano theme over a buzzing synth score.Frequently and misleadingly described as “the British Psycho”, this is the film that undid Michael Powell’s career – a serial-killer nightmare with strange echoes of his earlier film with Emeric Pressburger, A Canterbury Tale. Carl Boehm plays the deranged porn photographer and amateur cine-movie obsessive who films prostitutes at the moment he kills them. The sheer tattiness and seediness of postwar Britain is superbly conjured.A classic of English folk-horror: Edward Woodward plays the stolidly moralistic police officer who comes to a remote Scottish island community to investigate the case of a missing girl and is unsettled by the strange pagan practices. It is a society that has evolved separately from Britain’s mainland and its Anglican beliefs, but it looks like an alternative reality of fiercely insular, irrational England. Is there anything more Brexity than this?An eminent surgeon attempts a cosmetic reconstruction of his daughter’s face after she is disfigured in a road accident – using parts of faces of other young women that his assistant lures to his laboratory and kills. It is a horror movie in the tradition of Mary Shelley and yet also something of Beauty and the Beast, with the beastly father-figure turning his innocent daughter into something repulsive. Her mask is inexpressibly disturbing.Sissy Spacek is the bullied teen with telekinetic powers in this parable of bullying and misogyny, which is also a brilliant satire of high school, particularly the prom as a theatre of cruelty and anxiety. The violence and rage scream out of the screen.Jonathan Demme’s masterpiece of forensic psycho-macabre horror stars Anthony Hopkins, who brings a career’s worth of Shakespearean savvy to his greatest role: the imprisoned serial killer Dr Hannibal Lecter. Jodie Foster plays the FBI rookie Clarice Starling, who must convince Hannibal to offer invaluable help from behind his toughened glass in tracking down another murderer. But what will he want from her in return? A guignol gem.I have rewatched this a number of times and it just gets better, verging on classic status. A lonely and stressed young mother finds herself reading to her young son from a strange pop-up book he has found, called The Babadook, about a weird top-hatted figure that lives in the wardrobe. Too late, she realises that it is a satanically charged object and by reading it aloud she has made it come true.Stanley Kubrick’s gift for eerie grandeur is given free rein in this adaptation of the Stephen King novel (disliked by the author) about Jack Nicholson’s brooding writer, given the job as caretaker of an out-of-season hotel. There are sensational set pieces of horror and mystery: the lift shaft full of blood, the twin sisters appearing in the corridor.An elegant, sinister and scalp-prickling ghost story, based on Henry James’s story The Turn of the Screw. A governess, played by Deborah Kerr, takes charge of two children at a remote country estate and suspects that the house is haunted by the drunken valet and the former governess he seduced. She suspects the children can see these ghosts, too, and that these evil spirits have befriended them.There’s a remake on the way from Luca Guadagnino, and we have had many homages (from Darren Aronofsky’s Black Swan to Nicolas Winding Refn’s The Neon Demon), but here is the original and best. The extraordinary, operatic fantasy horror about a young American dancer discovering awful secrets at a German ballet school freaks out its audience with crazed intensity and eyeball-frazzling blocks of fierce colour.Low-key it may be compared with the jump-scare slashers, but this Ealing classic from 1945 is genuinely frightening: a portmanteau collection of five ghost stories, of which the most disturbing is probably the one directed by Alberto Cavalcanti, about a mad ventriloquist haunted by his dummy – a superb premonition of Psycho.One of the great event movies of the postwar era and an inspired exploitation nightmare that sensationally took Hitchcock – then in late middle-age – to the next level of cinematic greatness. Based on the novel by Robert Bloch – itself based on the grisly true story of the serial killer Ed Gein – it stars Janet Leigh as a realtor’s secretary who takes off with $40,000 in stolen cash and has to stay at a creepy old motel run by awkward Anthony Perkins, heading for a horrendous fate in the shower.William Friedkin’s horror masterpiece, the most famous of the devil-child wave made possible by Rosemary’s offspring, delivers a sledgehammer punch of fear – and a lumbar-puncture stab of horror. Max von Sydow plays a priest who is called in to cast out a devil occupying the body of a 12-year-old girl in Washington DC. The effects and prosthetics are still staggeringly good and the cataclysmic confrontation of good and evil is genuinely horrifying.For its sense of insidious and encircling evil, and the sensationally good performance from Mia Farrow, Rosemary’s Baby is unforgettable. Adapted by Polanski from the Ira Levin bestseller, it shows the demure, shy young title character (Farrow) moving in to a strange New York apartment building with her actor husband (John Cassavetes), becoming pregnant under strange circumstances and suspecting that a sinister satanic cult has designs on her baby.Nicolas Roeg’s magnificently disturbing ghost story, adapted by Alan Scott and Chris Bryant from the Daphne du Maurier short story, is an inspired combination of the erotic and the uncanny. Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie give superb performances as the parents of a dead child who encounter, in Venice’s dankly crumbling splendour, terrifying signs of her existence beyond the grave. It is a meditation on time, memory, the poignancy of married love and the inexplicable mystery of death — and very scary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1821c4439b82582dce039a5c1d5ce51d55550e3/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb251f24a914a0d0044ed8dd1aa785ee","title":"england costa rica international friendly match report","story":"These are the moments when it is probably wise to remember – this being England, after all – that it is never sensible to overdose on optimism before the World Cup actually starts.Yet there are at least grounds for positivity and increasingly there is a sense that Gareth Southgate’s players are high on confidence, capable of putting together some vibrant football and not showing any obvious signs of the end-of-season fatigue that has weighed them down before major tournaments in the past.Southgate is certainly entitled to be encouraged after another satisfying win most notable for the spectacular first-half goal with which Marcus Rashford announced his intentions to press for a starting place when England arrive in Russia on Tuesday.At the very least Rashford has reminded the England manager that, on form, he is capable of producing moments of outstanding and rare quality. He can be erratic sometimes, yes, but on this evidence he can trouble even the most accomplished defences and when Rashford can score goals of this brilliance it is tempting to make an argument that Southgate should find a way to shoehorn him into the team.The reality, however, is that by the time England are ready to face Tunisia in Volgograd on Monday week it might be that only John Stones from this starting lineup will be among Southgate’s first-team picks. The latest friendly was a game for the back-up players mostly. It was not only Rashford who seized the opportunity – Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Fabian Delph both impressed in their attacking midfield roles – but however much Southgate talked about places still being up for grabs the likelihood is that the players he selected for the 2-1 win against Nigeria last Saturday will, on the whole, begin in the World Cup.Jack Butland Surprisingly given the nod ahead of Jordan Pickford\u0026nbspbut the Stoke keeper made a couple of decent stops. 7Phil Jones Did little wrong but did not come under much pressure and\u0026nbspalways sense he could drop a clanger. 6John Stones Only player to start both warm-up games but gave the ball\u0026nbspaway a couple of times. 6Harry Maguire\u0026nbspLucky to get away with it on two occasions when Joel Campbell got in behind him. 6Trent Alexander-Arnold\u0026nbspUnlikely to oust Kieran Trippier for a starting\u0026nbspspot in Russia but the youngest player in the squad coped well. 7Jordan Henderson Wore the captain\u0027s armband and constantly looked to press the opposition – but Southgate may prefer Eric Dier. 7Danny Rose\u0026nbspShowed enormous bravery off the pitch this week and started\u0026nbspbrightly but was disappointing in second half. 6Ruben Loftus-Cheek Linked up well with Henderson and\u0026nbspprovided the assist for Rashford\u0027s opening goal. 7Fabian Delph Leeds lad gave a good account of himself at home and moved\u0026nbspseamlessly into a deep midfield role. 7Marcus Rashford\u0026nbsp(pictured) Staked claim to a starting spot in Russia with\u0026nbspblistering performance and scored terrific opener. 8Jamie Vardy Missed a chance to double the lead and only touched\u0026nbspball eight times in first half before being subbed on the hour. 5SubstitutesDanny Welbeck\u0026nbsp(on for Vardy) Ever-reliable forward came off the bench and made an impact with\u0026nbsping header from close range. 7Kieran Trippier\u0026nbsp(on for Alexander-Arnold) Should have done better from set pieces after coming on\u0026nbspbut seems likely to get a starting spot. 6Gary Cahill\u0026nbsp(on for Stones) Did not have much to do but was vocal and Southgate may be swayed by his valuable experience. 6Jesse Lingard\u0026nbsp(on for Loftus-Cheek) Only had 10 minutes to impress but came close to scoring straight away and looked lively again. 6\u0026nbspDele Alli\u0026nbsp(on for Henderson) Energetic when he came on, linking up well once again with Lingard and crossing for Welbeck\u0027s goal. 7Nick Pope (on for Butland)\u0026nbspIs unlikely to feature at all in Russia but given his England debut by Southgate, who has done so well in harvesting team spirit. 6– Ratings by Martha Kelner– Submit your own ratings at the bottom of the match reportThe encouraging part for Southgate is that, throughout his entire squad, there is not a single player who could be accurately described as off-form. Danny Welbeck, the only outfield player not to have started either of England’s last two games, was brought on just after the hour and, within 15 minutes, he had doubled the lead with a close-range header. Trent Alexander-Arnold acquitted himself well on his first international appearance, operating as a right-sided wing-back, and there was also a debut for Burnley’s Nick Pope, England’s third-choice goalkeeper, when he replaced Jack Butland during the second half.Jordan Henderson, who captained the side in Harry Kane’s absence, played with considerable authority – the choice between Henderson and Eric Dier increasingly looks like one of Southgate’s tougher decisions – and the only disappointment, perhaps, was that Jamie Vardy found it difficult to impress.The Leicester striker managed only eight touches in the opening half and was substituted after 61 minutes. He could not take his best chance with a spinning close-range effort and, by the end of the night, he might have been forgiven for wondering if he had fallen back in the pecking order of front players.Rashford, on the other hand, was electric, a frequent menace to the Costa Rica defence and clearly emboldened by scoring a 13th-minute goal from the kind of angle and distance, almost 30 yards out, that would have put off many players in the same position. His contact with the ball was delivered in a way that many players of his generation have copied from Cristiano Ronaldo, striking it with great power but in a way that is deliberately designed to make his shot dip late on, almost like a beach ball, in the final part of its trajectory.This one was aimed diagonally, right to left, and started off so high it gave the goalkeeper, Keylor Navas, no chance of reaching it. The ball finished in the top right-hand corner and it is fair to say the Leeds supporters in the Don Revie Stand who had booed Rashford’s name when the teams were read out – along with that of Phil Jones, another Manchester United player – changed their tune for the remainder of the evening. Well, until Jesse Lingard was brought on.Rashford had shown early on that he was in the mood, eluding one of the Costa Rica centre-halves, Kendall Waston, with a lovely piece of deceptive skill on the byline, but he was not the only England player to catch the eye. Loftus-Cheek’s link-up play was another prominent feature and Delph, a more accomplished player than many people appear to realise, looked comfortable occupying a more advanced midfield role than his usual position at Manchester City. Rashford was the obvious choice for the man-of-the-match award but Delph – one of five Yorkshiremen in England’s starting XI – would have had reasonable grounds otherwise.Costa Rica are 23rd in Fifa’s world rankings – only 11 places back from England – but they were overwhelmed by the energy of their opponents in the first half. It was a tepid display from los Ticos and, unlike during the Nigeria game, Southgate’s team did not relinquish their superiority after the interval.Butland had a relatively stress-free evening before making way for Pope and Southgate could also reflect on several other chances for England, most notably when Navas kept out Henderson’s 20-yard drive and Harry Maguire’s header was cleared off the goalline from a corner. Dele Alli, another second-half substitute, supplied the cross for England’s second goal. Rashford was also involved and Welbeck added the finishing touch with a stooping header."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/322d4e779f640b72d608276e1326a4831eb0c55a/87_43_4927_2956/master/4927.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90d1b7e72b90dd5ee8ee297076cd9e6d","title":"liverpool set to complete signing nabil fekir lyon","story":"• Deal to go through on Friday after Liverpool meet valuation• France international follows Fabinho and Naby Keita to AnfieldLiverpool are set to complete the signing of Nabil Fekir on Friday after meeting Lyon’s €60m (£53m) valuation of the France international.Fekir is on the verge of becoming Jürgen Klopp’s second major transfer of the summer, with Anfield officials having agreed a deal worth an initial €55m to the French club plus €5m in bonuses. The Lyon captain has informed his boyhood club of his preference for Anfield and the deal is expected to be finalised before the 24-year-old heads to the World Cup.Jean-Michel Aulas, the Lyon president, told his club’s website on Thursday that the deal was “at a standstill” and unlikely to be concluded before the World Cup. Liverpool, however, continued to press ahead with negotiations and appear to have broken Aulas’s resolve to keep the attacking midfielder until after the World Cup in the hope of starting an auction.Fekir is due to undergo a Liverpool medical at Clairefontaine, the France national team’s training base, before signing terms on Friday. Didier Deschamps’ side play their final World Cup warm-up game against the USA in Lyon on Saturday and the manager had instructed his squad to settle any outstanding transfer business before flying to Russia.Liverpool have already signed the defensive midfielder Fabinho from Monaco for £43.7m and Naby Keita will arrive from Red Bull Leipzig this summer for £52.75m. They have also registered interest in Xherdan Shaqiri, who is available for £12m-£13.5m after Stoke City’s relegation from the Premier League.Bayern Munich and Atlético Madrid have also been linked with Fekir, who can operate in a number of forward roles and would in effect be Philippe Coutinho’s replacement at Anfield. But his determination to join Klopp’s team and Liverpool’s willingness to go to €60m appears to have altered the stance of the Lyon president."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39797ece7dd8de16b4dbfd106a3dccef5ee8a88a/480_80_2124_1274/master/2124.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d3ca30b071fb7969955d63706fb4dd3","title":"england v costa rica international friendly live","story":"A spectacular goal from the eyecatching Marcus Rashford and a second from the substitute Danny Welbeck gave England a comfortable win in their final match before the World CupThat’s it for tonight’s blog. Thanks for your company and emails. See you next week - FOR THE WORLD CUP!Here’s Danny Taylor’s match report from Elland Road“It means a lot to be in the squad but it’s my aim to go there and play a major part. We know how far we’ve come on in the last 18 months so these games are just an opportunity to show it to everyone. Anything’s possible in Russia, so we have to go there with the highest expectations.”What would be your starting XI for Tunisia? This is what I think it will be: Pickford Walker, Stones, Cahill Alexander-Arnold, Dier, Young Lingard, Alli Sterling Kane.Peep peep! A comfortable win for England, in which Marcus Rashford was outstanding. He scored a belting first goal and helped create the second for the substitute Danny Welbeck. Trent Alexander-Arnold had a fine debut and Fabian Delph was quietly excellent. Those three, in particular, made a strong case to start against Tunisia in England’s first World Cup game.90 min Three minutes of added time.89 min Maguire’s loose header falls to Campbell, whose imperfect control allows Delph to clear at the second attempt.87 min A long spell of possession for Costa Rica. Eventually Matarrita whistles a shot from a tight angle that is comfortably saved by Pope.84 min The match is petering out. It’s been a good night for England, and particularly for Rashford, Delph and Alexander-Arnold.82 min The stretching Bolanos volleys over from Matarrita’s deep left-wing cross.81 min “Evening Rob,” says Paul Wilson. “Just wanted to congratulate Nick Pope on getting a run-out. He played for my beloved York City on loan in our run to the League 2 play-offs in 2014, and even then was among the best keepers I’ve seen. When we conceded a corner you never worried because Pope would just pluck it out of the air 10 feet above the penalty spot. Really pleased for him. Sadly, York have beyond wretched ever since his loan spell ended.”80 min Lingard almost scores straight away. He was found by a nice pass from Alli and danced away from one challenge before hitting a shot that was deflected behind for a corner.79 min Another England change: Lingard replaces Loftus-Cheek, who showed flashes of his devastating potential without consistently influencing the game.The trusty Danny Welbeck gets England’s second. Rashford, on the left, played a good short pass into the box for Alli. He opened his body and shaped a precise cross that was headed in from close range by the ing Welbeck.75 min Rose mishits a right-footed volley wide after good play for first Rashford and then Trippier. That was better from England.74 min Delph, now playing in the deeper midfield role, has had an excellent game.71 min Enough with the substitutions already. Costa Rica make another, with Ian Smith replacing Cristian Gamboa.70 min “Evening Rob,” says Matt Loten. “I’d just like to predict that, on this performance, England will not win the World Cup. If we can get Henderson and Dier playing together in the same midfield, however...”It’s Gerrard and Lampard all over again!69 min When the free-kick is finally taken, Trippier whips it a few yards wide. 68 min Excellent play from Loftus-Cheek, who uses his strength to hold off two challenges before being fouled 25 yards from goal by Matarrita. Gonzalez is booked for dissent.67 min The substitutions have disrupted the flow of the game, as you’d expect. If it stays like this I think England will be pretty happy, though they would like to have created more clear chances.65 min Changes galore for England: Cahill, Alli, Pope and Trippier replace Alexander-Arnold, Henderson, Butland and Stones. So, Nick Pope makes his international debut and Trent Alexander-Arnold leaves the field after a very impressive debut of his own. He is a serious contender to start against Tunisia a week on Monday.64 min Loftus-Cheek bursts forward from midfield but then picks the wrong option, hitting a tame shot wide from 25 yards.62 min “I am a Liverpool fan,” says Ricky Gill. “I don’t rate Henderson’s ability to shield a defence too highly however, he can spot a pass quicker than Dier and that allows England to play at a higher tempo. The matches when England play a double pivot with Henderson and Dier make for a... well “Dier” viewing. Pardon the pun.”It’ll be interesting to see if he plays both against Belgium. I don’t think he will unless, say, England need a draw to qualify for the last 16.61 min And a change for England: Welbeck replaces the subdued Vardy.60 min A double change for Costa Rica: Matarrita and Bolanos on, Oviedo and Campbell off.59 min “Evening Rob,” says Phil Sawyer. “A few accounts I read said that the turning point in 2014 was when Hodgson invited Gerrard to say a few words to the team and they were treated to a lengthy treatise on not going home having failed for England like previous tournaments he’d been involved in, which sucked the mood right out of the camp. Now, as a Liverpool supporter I love Gerrard to bits. But when it comes to taking the pressure off young shoulders, I rather prefer the input of an England manager who has been there and reacted to adversity by appearing in an advert with a paper bag over his head. At the end of the day (and I’m paraphrasing shamelessly from DaddyPig on the county cricket blog), it’s tremendously important, because it’s football. And it’s tremendously unimportant, because it’s football.”Where did you read that? If it’s true, and given their form in recent seasons, I shudder to think what he’ll do to the morale of the Rangers players.58 min Campbell gets the wrong side of Maguire, who recovers to block the eventual shot from the edge of the area. Moments later, Gamboa belts a shot over the top from distance. Butland had that covered.56 min A loose ball falls to Henderson, who sizzles a half-volley towards goal from 25 yards. It’s straight at Navas, who makes a bit of a mess of it but manages to shovel the ball behind for a corner. Alexander-Arnold takes it and picks out Maguire, whose header is kicked off the line.54 min Delph wakes England up with a surging run through midfield. Then Rashford is fouled by Waston for the 48th time tonight. Alexander-Arnold’s inswinging free-kick is cleared at the near post.51 min Urena’s deflected shot from the edge of the box is comfortably held by Butland. He has had so little to do in this game that he may literally start making saves in his sleep before the end.50 min It’s been a slow start to the second half. Typical England: first half good, second half not so good.48 min That’s a good stat from Clive Tydesley on ITV: in terms of caps, England will be the least experienced of the 32 squads in Russia. IS SOMETHING BRILLIANT HAPPENING?47 min “Rashford definitely deserves a start ahead of Sterling on the basis of more end product,” says Ricky Gill. “I think there is also a case for starting Dier in defence and Henderson as the midfield pivot. Delph needs to stop dropping deep into that pivot role, he looks better further up the field rather than trying to occupy the same space as Henderson. As a wing back I think Trent Arnold is superior to Trippier. England will miss the energy and drive of AOC in the advanced CM position.”I’m out on a limb here, but are you a Liverpool fan? (I do agree, particularly about Oxlade-Chamberlain.) 46 min Peep peep! Costa Rica begin the second half.“On Southgate and the press,” begins Alistair. “Remember, he got a right going over after missing that penalty in Euro 96, and still maintained an even keel. Obviously, managing England is another matter entirely, but I hope is prior experience inoculates him somewhat if things turn ugly in the future.”I thought the press were fairly kind to him after Euro 96, though it’s possible I’ve misremembered the entire 1990s.“I haven’t seen Pogba or Sanchez look this threatening recently,” says Adam Hirst.“Re Alistair’s praise for Southgate: agreed,” says George Chapman. “While I don’t think England have the experience to wow in Russia, there’s a sense Southgate could really improve things long-term and if this young squad continue to develop with their clubs (or elsewhere, eh Rashford?), by Euro 2020 we may actually have genuine cause for optimism.”Peep peep! England have controlled the game and deservedly lead through a spectacular goal from Marcus Rashford. See you in 10 minutes for the second half.45 min Henderson sprays a fantastic crossfield pass to Alexander-Arnold, who takes it down nicely but then puts his cross too close to Navas. Alexander-Arnold has had a fine half. I think I would start him ahead of Trippier in Russia.43 min “Praise also has to go to Gareth Southgate, he seems to be going about things the right way,” says Alistair. “He has made some tough decisions concerning players like Rooney, and managed to do it without creating a lot of needless drama.”Yes, he’s been so impressive in so many areas. It’ll be fascinating to see how he handles things when the press eventually turn on him.41 min Campbell gets the wrong side of Maguire, comes back onto his left foot and flicks an attempted through pass that drifts out of play for a goalkick.40 min What’s interesting about this Rashford performance, aside from the obvious, is that it has come in a roaming No10 role. He has hardly played there for club or country but he looks a natural.39 min Delph’s deep, outswinging corner from the left is headed back across goal by Maguire and hits the slightly unsighted Loftus-Cheek in the chest. Had he been able to control it he would have had a simple chance from six yards.37 min Rashford wins another free-kick on the left wing. Alexander-Arnold’s excellent inswinger is cleared for a corner...35 min I know he’s not to everyone’s taste, but when it comes to explaining tactics I think Glenn Hoddle is the best pundit on TV. He reads games so well.34 min England could potentially play Rashford and Sterling behind Kane in a 3-4-2-1 formation, but I’m sure Southgate will stick with this 3-3-2-1-1 shape.32 min A brilliant pass down the left by Rashford finds Delph, who doesn’t make the most of it. Rashford has been quite majestic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc3088e816602c5d57f572a10882f6c68c52450c/0_0_2283_1370/master/2283.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=829c2e70d7a9973a7e243204c86e8b33","title":"jezfest labour live ticket sales so slow giving away","story":"Ticket sales for Labour Live have been so slow that they are now being given away. Just another reminder for party members: participating in capitalism always gets you screwed overHow has Lost in Showbiz left it this late before focusing on Labour Live, the Labour party’s political-rally-cum-music-festival-cum-arts-event-cum-friendly-bombs? During the EU referendum, I seem to remember getting a full two columns out of Bpop Live, the concert to promote Brexit, featuring the sounds of Nigel Farage and Phats and Small – and that event never even happened. Another mixture of speakers and musical acts, some of whom had not lost court battles to trade under their own name, Bpop Live was pulled after failing to fill much past row B of the Genting Arena in Birmingham. The trouble with these political concerts is you need to make the offering really enticing, or you are left with a bit of a horror show. It’s not Bestival it’s Worstival.No such fate awaits Labour Live, which will be going ahead at White Hart Lane recreation ground on 16\u0026nbspJune even if Len McCluskey has to rush in a one-member, one-free-ticket ruling. Have you got tickets, which were priced at £35? What do you mean: “It’s literally the first Saturday of the World Cup and – shoot me if you like – I’d rather watch\u0026nbspFrance and then the Argies than John McDonnell”? That’s crazy\u0026nbsptalk.Admittedly, the event is perceived as having run into a few problems, not least the lineup. There was rather a lot of hype around Labour Live when it was announced, suggesting it would be the biggest and most slickly stage-managed political rally since any of the ones it’s tasteful to mention. Following Jeremy Corbyn’s very well-received appearance at Glastonbury last summer, it was expected that Labour could bring together some of the biggest entertainment properties in the Corbynverse – a sort of Infinity Rally featuring Stormzy and Lily Allen and whatnot.That was then. For whatever reason, Labour Live’s headliners are now the Magic Numbers (ask yer dad). Incredible, really, to think of the sheer volume of agents who have told their Corbyn-supporting clients that they are simply NOT doing this. I wonder what lies they have told? “No one but no one wants you to appear at this more than me, but the record company just won’t have it. It’s heartbreaking, but my hands are\u0026nbsptied.”Still, Jermain Jackman will be there, and Hookworms, and Reverend and the Makers (again, your dad can help), and the gig will obviously feat. Jeremy Corbyn. So the situation could be a lot worse. The problem with anti-EU concert Bpop Live was all the booked artistes pulling out when they discovered it was an anti-EU concert. This will not be the case with Labour Live. Pretty sure that when my colleague Owen Jones says he is going to be somewhere, he honours his commitment – unlike East 17 or the two remaining members of 5ive, who binned off Bpop Live when it started to look like a shitter.Even so, there are whispers that Labour could be in for a big financial hit on the event, never mind the PR awks of a sparsely filled venue. To this end, none other than Unite boss McCluskey has had to step in to get the show back on track, which – creatively – feels akin to the moment Bob Geldof got promoter Bill Graham on board for the US side of Live Aid.Indeed, it’s a shame Labour Live can’t avail itself of someone with even a hundredth of the talent and soul of the legendary and extraordinary Graham, who always spoke with wistful power of the cultural moment of 70s rock, where the possibility of immense change felt real and within the grasp of a generation. Then again, instinct suggests there are – how to put this? – other aspects of contempo Labour discourse that would have put Graham right off association with them.Anyway, they have got Len instead, which in one sense isn’t weird – he already has form as a mood-music promoter. As for his strategy on this occasion, Unite announced a couple of weeks ago that it is giving away 1,000 tickets and would even organise free transport to the event. Since then, Labour HQ has made further offers of free tickets to constituency Labour parties, along with promises to lay on transport. And this week, the Labour party announced: “We’re offering a limited number of £10 tickets to under-27s. But you’ve got to be quick!”Of course you have. Like the saying goes: the early bird catches the people who bought early bird tickets. “Is there a process to try and reclaim costs?” one irked Labour supporter wondered on Twitter. “I’ve spent £70 on two tickets.”There isn’t, alas. As a Labour spokeswoman told the Observer last Sunday: “Labour Live is one of the ways we’re continuing to open up politics to a wider audience and spread Labour’s message about how we can build a society that works for the many, not the few.”It certainly works for the many who are being given free tickets – but arguably less so for the few who paid actual money for them. I hope the latter group of suckers learns their lesson: participating in capitalism always gets you screwed over, while waiting for a free handout builds a concert we can all be proud of. I\u0026nbspalso hope the person in charge of this eccentric ticketing process will be chief secretary to the Treasury within four years.So there you have it. We have not yet got to the stage of needing to put on a concert to save the concert, but there is a clear sense that the Labour press office would now literally rather talk about the realities of their Brexit position than Labour Live.However, anti-Corbyn elements should not be tempted to fall into any traps with this one. Those seeking to extrapolate Corbyn’s electoral prospects should avoid reading anything whatsoever from Labour Live’s ticket sales data. After all, as mentioned, Brexit couldn’t sell out a Birmingham arena during the referendum campaign itself, but – yes, here it comes – just look what it’s selling out now!Exciting news this week for the #MeToo movement, which has caught the eye of the man who for so long was the holy grail of aspirational Hollywood actors.For decades, working with Woody Allen was always the greatest honour for any movie star, until – basically overnight – it wasn’t. Indeed, the director’s insistence on making an estimated 12 films a year meant that a couple of movies were still in post-production when the deluge of voices suddenly saying they would never work with him again broke. This left the stars of those movies in the odd position of being contractually obliged to promote the very same forthcoming films for which they were already apologising for appearing in.Whatever. The director himself has other fish to fry. “I should be the poster boy for the #MeToo movement,” explained Allen this week. “Because I have worked in movies for 50 years. I’ve worked with hundreds of actresses and not a single one — big ones, famous ones, ones starting out — have ever suggested any kind of impropriety at all. I’ve always had a wonderful record with them.”Well. I don’t think any women’s movement can really be regarded as having made it until a man wants to be its figurehead – and if the ladies of #MeToo are serious about taking this to the next level, they should do more than just place these peerless credentials on file."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42b2f0b933d273f4c8289f140f0a317220452480/0_33_3914_2348/master/3914.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aaaf828641535cf927951a95750cbe92","title":"beyonce jay z otr ii tour review opening night cardiff","story":"Principality Stadium, CardiffOn the opening night of their collaborative world tour, the biggest couple in pop are glorious and charismatic – even if the romantic story arc plays down their traumaAs self-mythologising couples go, not many come close to Beyoncé and Jay-Z. The pair’s first collaboration, ’03 Bonnie and Clyde, was a tale of devotional love accompanied by a video featuring Beyoncé as the ride-or-die moll to her rumoured boyfriend’s gangster. It’s a story they’ve stuck to over the years – this is their second On the Run tour, and the theme remains intact: the film that punctuates this first night show introduces “the gangster and the queen” and keeps returning to an image of a hotel room carpeted with cash. Yet the intervening decade and a half – and an infamous few seconds of CCTV footage from an elevator – has complicated what was once a straightforward way to bolster each other’s brands. Far from living in codependent bliss, theirs is a relationship now defined in the public eye by betrayal and rage. As the pair detailed on their respective recent albums – Lemonade and 4:44 – Jay-Z was unfaithful, almost letting, as the guilty party put it, “the baddest girl in the world get away”.So the narrative has been recalibrated: the pair begin proceedings by hammering home the deathless nature of their love rather than its perfection. On a colossal screen, footage and slogans reinforce this idea of resilience, taking in a staged argument between the pair and never before seen pictures of their baby twins. The effect feels remarkably intimate for a stadium show, but also scrupulously posed – a tone that can feel disorientating as Beyoncé switches between songs about crazed lust and ballads about romantic betrayal (most starkly on 2006’s newly relevant Resentment). But anyone hoping for this psychodrama in cartoonish panto format would have been sorely disappointed. The pair gaze at each other moonishly from the get-go: a vision of matrimonial love that, considering they are explicitly cashing in on their interpersonal trauma, can come off as slightly one-dimensional.Which is not to say the show that services this message isn’t staggeringly impressive. The Beyoncé-mania that has gripped pop culture in recent years isn’t just poptimism gone mad: this is a woman who matches increasingly sophisticated and trailblazing material with once-in-a-generation onstage charisma. Her swagger is such that it can feel like the power dynamic between the two performers has been upended – once the sidekick, nowadays she’s the one taking her rapper husband for a ride as he hitches his wagon to her staggering cultural capital. At first, this shift is writ large: Jay-Z initially seems as though he’s keeping the stage warm for Beyoncé while she gets her breath back. By the end though, he’s not been outshone – mainly because of his arsenal of glorious modern classics (99 Problems, Niggas In Paris, Big Pimpin’) and perhaps partly because of his excessive costume changes, which put Beyoncé’s meagre half-dozen sequined leotards in the shade.Where Jay-Z does his hits justice, Beyoncé provides both the little treats – mouthing along to Jay’s raps showcasing a peerless range of screwfaces mercilessly barking “sing it” to her apparently lax fanbase – and a couple of heartstopping one-offs. She’s chameleonic, segueing from an imperious rendition of Lemonade’s Led Zeppelin-sampling Jack White collaboration Don’t Hurt Yourself to operatic singing, flanked by her dancers in a renaissance tableaux. During Sorry, she pauses midway through to turn the lyric “suck on my balls” into a faintly chilling haka-style refrain (hilariously, the song is followed by Jay-Z’s deeply-ironic-in-the-circumstances 99 Problems).While Beyoncé’s recent shows have been characterised by identity and politics – her Coachella performance celebrated black college culture her Superbowl show paid tribute to the Black Panthers – that’s not the MO here. But the slivers of material in that department are worth waiting for. Excerpts from Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s We Should All Be Feminists speech gets pride of place on the massive screen Sorry is punctuated by Beyoncé asking women in the audience whether they’ve “had enough”, in highly charged fashion. Jay-Z takes the mantle when it comes to race, airing the video for 4:44’s The Story of OJ after a female dancer twists and turns to Nina Simone’s Four Women.The pair bow out with their evergreen 2003 hit Crazy In Love, a rendition of Jay Z’s Young Forever, and a film that sees them reconvene at the altar. It is hard to digest this smooth romantic arc when everyone knows how fraught their relationship has been – but that feeling is offset by the sheer majesty of their creative partnership, which surely only death could do part."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2df051c51a1ae01286266c2a0425993837afb536/15_0_5571_3342/master/5571.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cffb97722e73784694164fb3523a207","title":"ghosts tobias forge bands need to be larger than life","story":"With their twisted Catholic imagery, the Swedish band were one of the most mysterious in metal. But after lawsuits and infighting, their masks were ripped off …‘The plague, the apocalypse and the imminent death and destruction of our lives”: that is how Tobias Forge, the mastermind behind the Swedish band Ghost, describes their latest album, Prequelle. He thinks it may be the first positive record to be written about the Black Death. “The plague of the 1300s was a big killer which wiped out half of the European population and caused insurmountable trauma for the survivors,” he says. “But, in the midst of all this chaos and destruction, it caused a lot of regrowth – I’ve always found that very inspiring.”Until last year, Forge and the rest of the band were anonymous. If our interview had been conducted when any of Ghost’s previous full-length albums were released – Opus Eponymous (2011), Infestissumam (2013) or Meliora (2015) – Forge would have been incognito, dressed as one of the demonic masked figures, or “Nameless Ghouls”, that make up Ghost’s sinister backing band. Theories were rife, but, until 2017, no one knew who any of the band members were – rumours persist that Dave Grohl played with them live on several occasions – and all the songs are credited to a Nameless Ghoul.Then, in April 2017, four former band members filed a lawsuit against Forge, claiming he had taken control of business affairs without input from anyone else Forge countered that Ghost has always been his project and that the other members were paid a salary, essentially acting as his backing band. Forge was forced to emerge from the occult enigma he had hidden behind since 2006 and reveal his true identity.Apart from the lawsuit, things are going very well for Ghost. In 2016, the band won a Grammy in the best metal performance category for Meliora’s lead single, Cirice a new single, Rats, has racked up more than 7m YouTube views Prequelle has been released to strong reviews and Forge will finally be able to realise his ambitions for the band’s live shows in December when Ghost play two 20,000-capacity gigs on the east and west coasts of the US. In the UK, the band were last seen headlining a sold-out 2,000 capacity Forum in London, but they dominate conversations of potential future headliners for this weekend’s Download, by far and away the UK’s largest metal festival.“My aim is absolutely to fill those large stages,” Forge says. “Unfortunately, most bands don’t do that. I’m not saying that they’re not good enough necessarily, but what they bring in terms of performance is not big enough. If we want to have a rock culture where we go to wide-open spaces and see larger-than-life spectacle, then bands need to step up. We need to put a little faith into the teenagers that are forming bands now it takes more than a stack of Marshalls to get a big rock crowd enthusiastic these days.”Ghost’s religious iconography has captured the imagination of the extreme metal crowd, but the band have more in common musically with the psychedelic prog-rock stylings of Blue Öyster Cult than the apoplectic black metal maelstrom of, say, Bathory. Ghost’s use of occult visuals has led to misunderstandings, particularly in the US: Forge maintains that they use this imagery because “it looks awesome” rather than because they are trying to send middle American children to hell.Forge maintains that Ghost isn’t mocking the church, but rather mimicking some of its rituals. “A rock concert fulfils the same service that church can provide,” he says. “It puts people in an environment that is greater than themselves.” As we talk, he debates the merits of organised religion with himself. “You have to be in the favour of this condemning God who could throw you down to hell, and it’s this that makes especially linear religions so dangerous because it’s always looking up and kicking down,” he says. “Even the architecture – churches were regarded as unearthly because they were so imposing. They combined threat with inclusion and salvation.” He thinks again. “But then there is a lot to learn from the church. Not everyone going to service does that as a way of hypocritically fooling someone. Most people try to look after themselves and their own and are trying to do things the way that they see fit.”Each album has seen subtle variations in the Ghost aesthetic, with three different iterations of a sinister pope figure, Papa Emeritus – widely believed to be Forge – fronting the band while flanked by the revolving lineup of Nameless Ghouls. But Prequelle involves the biggest visual and thematic shift. A series of tongue-in-cheek videos introduced the newly appointed, sharp-suited Cardinal Copia – again, likely to be Forge – who now leads the congregation in lieu of Papa Emeritus. But the Papa lineage is still represented in the form of the frail, ageing Papa Nihil, who has a gloriously over-the-top saxophone solo. “I’m a big fan of the sax as an ingredient,” says Forge, who has played most of the instruments on Ghost’s albums. “It is Americana for me. It’s Cheers and baseball and Dodge cars, filtered through rock’n’roll.

Songs such as Dance Macabre and See the Light contain some of the band’s catchiest choruses yet, so Forge’s quiet optimism and ambition is understandable. “There seem to be some reservations about bringing spectacle to the rock world, but we’re happy to fill that void,” he says. “Bands need to be larger than life and that’s something that I’m not able to do as Tobias.

All look the same in the tests performed.But whatever the ultimate source of the material, if microbial life did find a foothold on Mars, the presence of organics meant it would not have gone hungry. “We know that on Earth microorganisms eat all sorts of organics. It’s a valuable food source for them,” said Jennifer Eigenbrode, a biogeochemist at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.“While we don’t know the source of the material, the amazing consistency of the results makes me think we have a slam-dunk signal for organics on Mars,” Eigenbrode added. “It is not telling us that life was there, but it is saying that everything organisms really needed to live in that kind of environment, all of that was there.”The car-sized rover, which has trundled a careful 12 miles (19.3km) since it landed in the planet’s Gale crater nearly six years ago, detected a slew of organic molecules in pieces of Martian mudstone it drilled from the ancient lake bed and heated in its onboard oven. When the samples reached 500 to 820C, the rover’s instruments detected a range of so-called aromatic, aliphatic and thiophenic vapours. The science team believes these are breakdown products of even larger organic molecules, similar to those found in coal, which were trapped in the Martian rocks in the distant past.“To me it is amazing that we can show we have organic matter preserved for more than 3bn years in these rocks,” said Kirsten Siebach, a planetary geologist who was not involved in the work at Rice University in Houston, Texas. “This is very promising for the preservation of potential ancient life on the planet.”“These molecules could have been part of life, but they could also have been food for life,” Siebach added. “To know that the water really was full of organic molecules really opens up the different ways that life could have existed on Mars.”The Nasa rover has found hints of organics on the planet before. In 2015, mission scientists reported that Curiosity had detected whiffs of chlorine-containing organics in the planet’s rocks, but concerns over potential contamination and instrument glitches meant that the results did not convince everyone.The latest findings, reported in the journal Science, are far more compelling. According to Inge Loes ten Kate, a geologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, “the results convincingly show the long-awaited detection of organic compounds on Mars.”The discovery of organics in rocks mere centimetres beneath the Martian surface has raised hopes of finding richer deposits of the compounds deeper down. In those may lurk tell-tale signs of life itself, scientists say. “If we can find things like fatty acids, that would be the first potential hints of life,” said Eigenbrode.In a separate paper published in Science, another Nasa-led team describes Curiosity’s latest measurements of the Martian atmosphere. Before the rover touched down in August 2012, missions to the red planet had already spotted methane in the atmosphere which spiked from time to time as plumes of the gas apparently rose from the planet. The discovery fuelled speculation that the gas might be the expulsions of Martian microbes eking out an existence deep underground. More mundane explanations included chemical reactions between water and Martian rocks.The new measurements do not settle the question, but the team led by Christopher Webster at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion lab in California reveals the first regular pattern in Mars’s fluctuating methane. Tests on the Martian air show that background levels of methane rise and fall with the changing seasons. As winter gives way to summer in the northern hemisphere, the methane triples from 0.24 to 0.65 parts per billion.Webster suspects that reservoirs of methane lie deep under the surface of Mars, perhaps in water crystals called clathrates, and leak the gas continuously. When the methane reaches the surface, it sticks to Martian dust but is released in ever-increasing quantities when the ground warms up in the summer.“These subsurface reservoirs could be from ancient methane that was trapped underground, or from methane that is forming today. Either way it could be produced by chemistry or by microbial activity. We certainly cannot rule out a biological source at this stage,” said Webster.Taking the measurements was no easy task. A year on Mars lasts two Earth years, so to spot a seasonal pattern in the methane levels, the scientists had to take readings for four Earth years. “That’s why it has taken us so long,” said Webster. “Talk about having patience.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da2c359956f50125815a6b21db1a23ef2a43ceb2/0_42_2760_1656/master/2760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=351ae426f46b9951ae89c944f5e317e3","title":"simona halep sweeps aside garbine muguruza reach french open tennis final","story":"It is testimony to the depth of their friendship that Sloane Stephens’s perfectly shaped backhand down the line to put Madison Keys out of her misery and out of their French Open semi-final on Thursday was struck almost apologetically.When it landed like a merciful knife into the deuce corner to end their one‑sided match in just an hour and 17 minutes, the winner raised her arms in celebration, smiled broadly then looked immediately up the court on a packed Philippe-Chatrier to commiserate with her fellow American.Stephens played an almost perfect defensive game, soaking up seven aces and keeping her mistakes to a minimum, to win 6-4, 6-4 and book a place in the final on Saturday against the world No\u0026nbsp1, Simona Halep, who earlier took an hour and a half to break down the resistance of Garbiñe Muguruza, 6-1, 6-4.In the second semi-final a plainly nervous Keys hit 41 unforced errors, 22 of them on her forehand, as she strove to get into the contest. They have been here before. In the US\u0026nbspOpen final last year – a first for both of them – Stephens won in 61 minutes, forcing 30 unforced errors from Keys, keeping her own down to six.“It’s always hard playing someone from your country and such a good friend,” Stephens said. “I was just pleased to get through that today and play some good tennis.”Key to her improvement after a long stretch out injured before her comeback last year has been Stephens’s noticeably calmer demeanour. She looks content, on and off the court, and her game has benefited from it.Halep will be an altogether different proposition. She is 5-2 up in their careers and Stephens has not beaten her since winning on the hard courts of the Australian Open in 2012. In Paris, however, the Romanian’s clay smarts make a considerable difference she beat Stephens 6-4, 6-3 in the quarter-finals four years ago.While Stephens, the No\u0026nbsp10 seed, has had an easier tournament, Halep will probably start favourite. Her record on clay this season is 15-3 and, although her serve faltered a little on Thursday, she had plenty left against Muguruza.It is a compliment to the Russian as any win against Sharapova, even at this stage of her career, takes the sort of perseverance that can lead on to more success in that tournament.Halep’s one problem here had been starting strongly. She dropped her first set of the tournament to Alison Riske, struggled at the beginning of her third-round match against Andrea Petkovic before bagelling her in the second set, and went down in a first‑set tie-break in the quarters against Angelique Kerber. Not this time.“Sometimes it’s working well, sometimes not,” she said. “But, if you finish the match in a good way, doesn’t matter that much. Today I just felt good on court. I felt positive and I started to play very well from the\u0026nbspbeginning.”This is her fourth final in a grand slam tournament – although she is yet to break through – and Stephens’s second. But Halep says she will do nothing different.“I don’t know what I would change – probably nothing,” she said. “I will keep my routine.“I have more experience now. I feel calm. And I have two more days until we play. I will stay chilled, I will relax. And then we will see what is going to happen on Saturday. But, for sure, I will fight for every ball.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4589948bf8ad3d372b3969e5506a58d901bdf739/0_32_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62f579b185e5579de0b1ebd976b2cf97","title":"wakefield wigan super league match report","story":"Shaun Wane insisted on Thursday night that “there is no panic at all” at Wigan, after yet another defeat for the Warriors amid off-field turmoil at one of Super League’s most famous clubs.This was Wigan’s third successive defeat since the sudden decision from Wane to announce he would be ending his 30-year association with the club at the end of this season.The Warriors have scored just four tries in those three games.The headlines which accompanied the ill-fated behaviour of the Tomkins brothers last weekend have stolen much of the spotlight in the past seven days, but it is impossible to avoid the fact that on the field Wigan’s form has collapsed since news of Wane’s impending departure broke.“There’s absolutely no panic at all,” Wane said. “We have to improve and we need to be better, work harder, and I need to be smarter. But they’re a strong bunch, and I know people will enjoy the position we’re in.”Home games against Wigan usually bring out the best in Chris Chester’s Wakefield side, and by the end it was hard to argue with the final scoreline being so comprehensively in Trinity’s favour. Like Wigan they, too, have only league matters to focus on after exiting the Challenge Cup but it is not unreasonable that, with more performances such as this, a top-four push could be realistic. They have now beaten the league’s top two at home this season.With one of their greatest sons, Neil Fox, in attendance, this was a performance of which he would have approved. “We want to be in that top six every year, and it’s really important for us now to invest a bit more money in the team – but we’re looking up, not down,” Chester said post-match.Wakefield took an early lead when some wonderful lead-up play allowed the wing Ben Jones-Bishop to cross. Ryan Hampshire improved that try with a penalty before Bill Tupou finished well shortly after.Trinity’s dominance emanated from the strength of their pack, and after the outstanding David Fifita won them another penalty Hampshire improved again to make it 14-0. By the time Wigan scored via Gabe Hamlin, it ended a barren run of 184 minutes without a point.Trailing 14-6 at the break, it was clear the first score after half-time was vital. It went to Wakefield as Jones-Bishop superbly picked a Sean O’Loughlin pass with the visitors pressing to race the length and, realistically, consign Wigan to yet another defeat.Tom Johnstone then produced a magnificent finish after another Wigan error, and while the visitors did briefly threaten a thrilling finish when Tom Davies and Morgan Escare scored it always felt a stretch too far for a side so dramatically out of sorts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69881e930a58569e24bfb43b5bb0ba054993b259/0_176_5292_3175/master/5292.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24fa1bccb404d423bd3f74263f7535d7","title":"my name is lucy barton review laura linney triumphs as a writer confronting her past","story":"Bridge theatre, LondonElizabeth Strout’s novel works outstandingly on stage, thanks to sole performer Linney’s nuanced command of the narrativeNovels, depending on the stream of time, rarely make good plays. Elizabeth Strout’s first-person narrative, longlisted for the Man Booker prize in 2016, however, breaks the rules and fits perfectly on the stage. That’s partly because of the quality of the writing and partly because of a beautifully nuanced solo performance by Laura Linney: a space that recently looked underpopulated with a four-character play, suddenly feels colonised by Linney’s commanding presence. Fans of the book will know that it is the reminiscence of a writer hospitalised for nine weeks in New York by a mysterious illness. But the focus is on five days when the eponymous heroine renews acquaintance with her mother, who has come to visit her from rural Illinois and from whom she has been long estranged. The two women talk, gossip about people from Lucy’s past, warily seek each other’s love. In the end, the mother departs as abruptly as she came and you feel the two women have briefly bonded without ever addressing their shared guilt: in the mother’s case, over Lucy’s impoverished childhood and, in Lucy’s, over her own necessary desertion.It sounds slight: in fact, it’s a story full of mysterious resonances. What comes out in performance, even more than in reading the book, is the idea that, even if you totally reinvent yourself, your past remains inescapable. Lucy has sought to overcome a childhood in which she and her siblings were beaten and deprived of the consolations of TV, films and magazines. Her father, who fought in the second world war, suffered from what we would now call post-traumatic stress disorder. Fleeing Illinois, Lucy has settled in New York, married, had children and acquired the ruthlessness that is part of a successful writer’s equipment. Yet, as Lucy admits, the Barton family provided a structure she was unaware of, until it was ended by death. Although I was sorry not to hear more of Lucy’s literary mentor, Sarah Payne, Rona Munro’s adaptation is sensitive to Strout’s structure. Richard Eyre’s production also has a distilled clarity: Bob Crowley’s set consists of a hospital bed and chair, while Luke Halls’s video design modulates between vistas of the gleamingly geometric Chrysler building and Illinois acres of soybeans and corn, which seem to stretch to infinity. But it is Linney who triumphantly carries the evening. I’d seen her once before on stage, in Eyre’s Broadway production of The Crucible, where she caught perfectly Elizabeth Proctor’s puritan severity. Here she switches easily between different modes. She talks to us, the audience, with warmth and ease. When she characterises Lucy’s mother, prattling on about the marital misfortunes of sundry relations, her voice acquires a rasping, midwestern edge. As Lucy relives her hospital memories, Linney is even more extraordinary: she shifts between exasperated fury at her mother’s wilful incuriosity and loving astonishment at this unworldly old woman’s ability to negotiate labyrinthine hospital corridors and the New York jungle. You can see the story in several ways but it is partly about the enforced loneliness of the writer who, at the same time, reinforces our common humanity. Linney, as a performer, has mastered the art of public solitude and gives you the uncanny feeling that you are listening not to an invented story but a slice of lived experience."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dfe838e61dbf86dd51293d289f1466782d89e3e/355_981_4210_2527/master/4210.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3fb9524705a26ceddb59b0e72d228d4","title":"sophie treadwell machinal ruth snyder almeida london","story":"When Rebecca Hall read it she couldn’t breathe. After Fiona Shaw played the role she got letters full of loneliness. This is the true story behind Sophie Treadwell’s trailblazing playIn 1927, Ruth Snyder dominated America’s headlines. Accused of murdering her husband, she became the first woman in New York state to die in the electric chair. The press slavered for stories about her photographer Tom Howard even smuggled a camera into her execution chamber at Sing Sing. His picture of Snyder, hooded and restrained, was splashed over the Daily News under the headline: “Dead!”Journalist Sophie Treadwell didn’t miss a day of the trial, although she wouldn’t report on it. Snyder’s husband was murdered for his life insurance and the case inspired the novel Double Indemnity by another reporter, James M Cain. But Treadwell took Snyder’s story and created a claustrophobic panorama of the American nightmare. Her play Machinal shows its heroine – referred to simply as Young Woman – to be lonely in marriage and motherhood. Bliss briefly blooms with a lover, but only leads to the chair.Lyndsey Turner revived Machinal on Broadway in 2013 and lauds “the way Treadwell follows, with brutal, inexorable logic, the journey of an unremarkable woman through a series of encounters which lead her to commit a remarkable act”. Every aspect of Snyder’s intimate life had been picked over in print Turner argues that Howard’s image of the accused, “sitting dead in an electric chair for all the world to see, must have struck Treadwell as obscene. Even in death, Snyder was regarded as public property.” “Because it was a story people knew, Treadwell could be incendiary,” argues Natalie Abrahami, who directs the Almeida theatre’s production opening this month. “She could hold the mirror up and say: ‘This is the world. Is this the way it should be?’” The question has lingered through the intervening 90 years, especially around women struggling to be heard. “I don’t imagine that when she wrote it in 1928 she thought that it would have such resonance now.”A decade before Machinal’s extraordinary success (the young Clark Gable played the lover on Broadway, and it was also a West End hit), Treadwell won a reputation in journalism. “Treadwell’s interests in journalism and theatre emerged simultaneously,” explains Jerry Dickey of the University of Florida. “In her early days as a reporter in San Francisco, she was prodded by her editor to engage in stunt reporting – Treadwell used her talents as an actress to assume a fictional persona and do undercover investigations.” She caused a sensation in 1915, posing as a prostitute to expose hypocritical charitable institutions.“I don’t believe there is an editor in America who would dare turn down anything that you write in France,” wrote her boss in San Francisco during the first world war. Women were discouraged from reporting from the frontline, but Treadwell travelled under a safe conduct pass. In Mexico, she scored an exclusive interview with Pancho Villa (inspiring her 1922 melodrama Gringo) in America she investigated factory work, equal pay and immigrant communities. Journalism offered access, and as in her drama, says Dickey, “she typically gravitated to the outcast, the poorly understood, the unconventional”.Dickey sees her reporter’s sensibility in Machinal: “She describes it much as she did in her previous newspaper accounts – with attention to the physical details of the woman defendant’s behaviour and the coarseness of the male jury and judicial system.” However non-naturalistic, Machinal retains a journalist’s feel for distilling a story to its juicy essence. Abrahami notes that “Snyder and her lover Judd Gray were tried as a couple, but he is edited out … She makes sure you see the machine, the structure of society.”Part of the play’s modernist audacity is in the soundscape Treadwell specifies. Clattering typewriters, deafening construction, the radio’s incessant chat and croon. They might suggest a metropolis bustling with opportunity – but they oppress the heroine, drowning her voice and squeezing her thoughts. To Turner, they “evoke a machine working at full speed”.Machinal premiered a year before the Wall Street crash demonstrated that the machine of American capitalism wasn’t infallible. “The play gives the lie to the image of the 1920s as a decade of unprecedented freedom,” argues Turner. “It’s a savage indictment of a society whose pursuit of efficiency and prosperity leads to a woman becoming trapped in the very machines designed to liberate her.”As I sit with Abrahami at the Almeida, the desk is awash with printouts from Treadwell’s archive at the University of Arizona. “If the writer was here, I’d ask loads of questions,” she explains. “When the writer is dead, I don’t know how to do that, other than by going through all the drafts to understand their process.” Leafing through the sheaves (“her handwriting is so beautiful”), she charts the play’s “juggernauting through these stages of life – daughter, wife and mother. It feels cinematic – the forward momentum is so extreme.”Abrahami traces the dialogue’s emerging musicality: “It’s written in the jazz age and has those syncopated rhythms.” The heroine struggles with the caffeinated chatter of the opening office scene. Her agitated interior monologues, built from shards of distress, “feel like a new form – I’ve never read anything like it”.When Rebecca Hall first read the script, she felt like she “couldn’t breathe for a minute”. Hall played the lead for Turner, who considers that “it takes a great deal of humanity, craft and courage to play a character who isn’t allowed to act on her own behalf.” Fiona Shaw, who led the last major British revival, directed by Stephen Daldry at the National Theatre in 1993, describes the challenge differently: “To play a not particularly interesting, not particularly good person. The morality of the evening doesn’t lie in her hands.”“It’s so brave,” Shaw reflects. “It gets right down to the bone.” Daldry and designer Ian MacNeil created a forbidding set that revolved, loomed and sank, stomping over the heroine’s sensibilities. But “in my mind I was in an empty room” says Shaw. She reached back to childhood for a telling gesture of the heroine’s loneliness. “I raised and kissed my own knee when she was getting ready for bed – because she had never been kissed.” She remembers the unusual amounts of mail she received from audience members – “men as well as women” – identifying with that isolation. Abrahami says: “I’m interested in unearthing the empowerment of the next generation. In the final scene the Young Woman says about her daughter, ‘Let her live!... There’s so much I want to tell her.’ Sophie Treadwell is talking to us from the grave, asking: are we letting women make the choices they need to make?”Abrahami indignantly brandishes an encyclopedia of American theatre. “There’s pages on Eugene O’Neill, but just one line on Sophie Treadwell: she wrote Machinal.” It can be hard to judge why her other plays didn’t gain traction. She wrote about Mary Wollstonecraft and Edgar Allan Poe: the latter script was designed for star actor John Barrymore, whom she sued when, as Abrahami tartly observes: “It appeared miraculously as a play written by his wife under a different title.”Seven of her dramas played on Broadway. Dickey says Treadwell “often wrote about characters that in some ways resembled herself – unconventional, uncompromising and filled with contradictions. With the exception of Machinal, Broadway audiences and producers consistently had difficulty empathising with Treadwell’s central characters.” Treadwell largely abandoned theatre and then journalism, after reporting from Mexico during the second world war and from devastated Germany in 1949: that same year, aged 69, she adopted a German baby. She spent her last years in Arizona and died in 1970. Everyone I interview wishes she had wider recognition. “She seems to me completely ahead of her time,” Abrahami insists. “A beacon. What I sense in the writing is her drive. If she wants to report from the frontline, she’s going to the frontline. She wants to go to Mexico? She’ll do that. She strikes me as a forthright person who saw the world as it was and wanted to say something about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ade584977bda300e1f274d012b03a43b24b5d59e/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f11feb8501e8fc72f912209e699e9009","title":"facebook private posts public glitch","story":"Company says it will notify users affected by bug involving its ‘audience selector’ toolFacebook said Thursday that it would notify 14 million users that posts they intended to share privately may have been published publicly, the company’s latest setback as it tries to rebuild user trust after the Cambridge Analytica scandal.The issue arose from a bug affecting Facebook’s “audience selector” tool, which allows users to decide whether to publish a post only to their friends or to a broader audience. The tool usually remains on the setting that was used most recently so that a user who only wants to share posts with friends does not have to keep selecting that option. But while the bug was active, from 18 May to 27 May, the setting was automatically changed to public.“We have fixed this issue and starting today we are letting everyone affected know and asking them to review any posts they made during that time,” Erin Egan, Facebook’s chief privacy officer, said in a statement. “We’d like to apologize for this mistake.” Facebook said it had reverted the audience settings to users’ prior preference. It will also show affected users a notification with an explanation and apology, and urge them to review any posts they made during the time period when the bug was active. The company’s quick admission of the error appears to be part of its efforts to increase transparency and regain trust following the Cambridge Analytica revelations. This spring, Facebook was harshly criticized for failing to inform users whose data had been improperly shared with the political consultancy until more than two years after the  had first reported on the issue. The two privacy lapses involve very different types of data, however. Jonathan Albright, the research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, has argued that Facebook’s audience tools, which it often touts as giving user’s control over their privacy, should instead be deemed “publicity settings”, because they only affect the audience of information that a user chooses to publish. The data involved in the Cambridge Analytica scandal was the massive amounts of information that Facebook gathers from users’ online behavior – such as liking posts or browsing the web – in order to target them with advertising."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82c90726839a6e90168dfe6ecba072f16e38618d/0_0_3675_2205/master/3675.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=199b98df08344ecccb5431473cee3e25","title":"marshall major iii bluetooth review wireless headphones","story":"The much-loved British brand has improved its wireless on-ear range, perfect for metal and hip-hop heads alikeThe Marshall Major III Bluetooth headphones are the latest in the much-loved British audio brand’s wireless headphone range, and while the changes are minor over the last pair they are still a winning combination of look, sound and battery life.You’d be hard pressed to notice the difference at first glance between 2016’s Major II Bluetooth and the new Major III Bluetooth. But compare them side by side and you realise they are slimmer and better looking, maintaining the classic Marshall styling in black vinyl.In fact, the new headphones are 24g lighter, which combined with softer ear pads make them a touch more comfortable to wear. They still squeeze my head pretty hard, but the top band does give a bit so they will eventually wear in.They are on-ear headphones, meaning they sit directly on your ear, not around it. The arms are slimmer and simplified, but maintain their height, twisting and tilting degrees of freedom so that they sit flat against your ear. The controls have been simplified for the Major III, with the brilliant gold-coloured metal joystick at the bottom of the left phone taking over all functionality. Hold it in for a few seconds to turn them on or off, press it once to pause or play the music, twice to trigger Google Assistant or Siri, tilt it left or right to skip the track and up or down to adjust volume. It all works very well, making you wonder why so many other manufacturers don’t have a similar control scheme.The Bluetooth connection is strong in all scenarios and supports aptX for higher fidelity and lower latency streaming with modern Android smartphones. Pairing is easy – just hold down the joystick for a few more seconds when powering the headphones on and find them on your phone.A standard 3.5mm analogue headphone socket is in the right ear cup for listening wired or when the battery runs out.The Major headphones have always sounded good with rock and similar genres, but the Major III Bluetooth suit a wider range of music types. They still sound great with driving rock music, but feed them something slightly more subtle such as the live version of Hotel California by the Eagles from Hell Freezes Over and you can hear good separation, punchy bass drums and clear vocals. The sound is very direct and those looking for thundering bass will have to look elsewhere. But the Marshalls make anything sound good, from Librarian by My Morning Jacket and Do I Wanna Know? by the Arctic Monkeys at the indie-rock end of things, to hip-hop tracks such as Dr Dre’s Forgot About Dre or Can’t Take It With Me by Blue Sky Black Death.The new Marshalls lasted well over 30 hours in my testing, making them some of the longest-lasting Bluetooth headphones around. You’ll probably be able to go weeks of commuting between charges, even at relatively high volumes.They charge in half the time that the older model did, going from dead to fully charged in around three hours via the microUSB socket in the right earcup.The Marshall Major III Bluetooth only come in black and cost £129, which puts them in the mid-range of Bluetooth headphones. Competitors range from around £50 and up. The previous generation Major II Bluetooth are still on sale for £69, while a wired-only version of the Major III cost £69 and the Marshall Mid Bluetooth cost £169.The Marshall Major III Bluetooth are another brilliant pair of wireless on-ear headphones from the British audio brand that bring great sound, very long battery life and classic styling.They aren’t perfect, squeezing my head a little too hard, lacking NFC for instant pairing and with the cost of Bluetooth headphones coming down over the last couple of years they’re not quite as good value as they were in 2016.But the Major III Bluetooth are packed with small improvements over almost every aspect of the design, fit and sound compared to the previous generation, and worth considering, particularly if you’re into driving rock music.Pros: great sound, long battery life, great controls, fold up for travel, sturdy, great look, good connectivityCons: on-ear design may not be comfortable for everyone, no NFC for one-touch pairing"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fafbed2da0a9e10b27586cf3b7d57f425e57361d/0_118_6070_3642/master/6070.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8abd6d9320440e95eb4714d8d40949d2","title":"how back up holiday photos without using laptop cloud wifi","story":"Graham and his wife take thousands of photos while travelling but aren’t always near wifi – is there a cloudless alternative?We take thousands of photos on our caravan holidays, and I like to back them up every day or so. At present, I take a laptop and an external hard drive, so I have a copy on the laptop in the caravan plus a copy on the hard drive in my car.Is there a way to make backups from SD cards to hard drives without carrying a laptop? I should add that many of the caravan sites we visit do not have wifi, so cloud backup is not practicable. GrahamBacking up photos used to be a problem for people taking exotic holidays. I thought it had gone away, thanks to advances in technology.First, SD storage cards have got bigger and faster. Unless you are a professional sports photographer shooting sequences of RAW images, it takes a long time to fill affordable 64GB or 128GB SD cards, or even larger cards. You can easily carry 1TB without even noticing. (Video photographers may still have problems.)Second, laptops have become smaller and lighter over the past decade, and they generally have much better battery life. It wasn’t fun backpacking a 2.5kg laptop plus charger, but 1kg alternatives have been around for at least a decade. And since you have a caravan, I wouldn’t have thought the weight mattered.In my case, the 11.6in laptop is much lighter than the DSLR, extra-wide zoom, prime lens and flashgun. If you’re using a compact camera with a vintage laptop, things might be different. However, you could always buy a mini-laptop with a 7in screen, such as the GamePad GPD Pocket, GPD Pocket or Mini PC.Third, wireless connections are now widely available. I cede to your superior knowledge of caravan sites, but I expect you pass through small towns that have free wifi. Even if it’s too slow to do complete backups, you could always upload copies of your top three photos of the day.You could also use a 3G or 4G wireless connection to upload photos. This can be worth it to pro photographers who buy data-only sim cards for the purpose, but it’s an expensive way to back up holiday snaps.In general, I think the best solution is to buy lots of large SD or microSD cards and carry a small laptop. This is what I do. However, not all old equipment can handle large cards. Check the manuals or search online to find out how big an SD card your camera can handle, and whether your laptop can read it. If it can’t, a little USB adapter will probably solve the problem: I use an Anker adaptor that can work with two cards – one microSD and one SD – at the same time.When SD cards appeared, they used Microsoft’s FAT12 or FAT16 file system, so they could only store up to 2GB of data. However, SDHC cards, which use FAT32, can store up to 32GB, while SDXC cards can store up to 2TB using exFAT. With storage capacities above 16GB – typically 32GB, 64GB and 128GB – it’s rarely worth the effort of deleting photos. Just stick a new card in when the old one is full, and reformat it later if really necessary.If camera capacity is the bottleneck, you could back up your camera’s small SD cards to large SDXC cards, or microSD cards.SD cards are not impervious to damage: I have one that no longer works after getting crushed in my wallet. However, they’re probably safer than external hard drives, especially the ones not designed for travelling. SD cards don’t break when you drop them.People have been looking for a ways to back up CompactFlash and SD cards for many years, but I didn’t notice any making an impact on the consumer market. That changed with the Gnarbox, which raised over $500,000 on Kickstarter in 2015. The company now has three products, and the Gnarbox 2.0 SSD is on the way. It’s on track to raise more than $1 million on Kickstarter, and will ship to the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, among other places. Pre-launch prices range from $299 (128GB) to $699 (1TB).The Gnarbox is actually a very small computer with its own processor and memory. The clever bit is that it’s controlled from a smartphone app, so you get some of the benefits of a laptop without the size, weight or screen.Of course, the need for a processor and memory pushes up the price. A 128GB Gnarbox costs £329.99 at Amazon while 256GB jumps to £449.99. By contrast, you can buy a 256GB SD card for £78.46.The Gnarbox can solve the storage problem for members of the GoPro-using, drone-flying, smartphone-addicted post-laptop generation. But you can buy devices that do more for less.Several companies have launched external hard drives (EHDs) with SD card slots. Some of them also have wireless connectivity. Unfortunately, I haven’t tried any, so I can’t comment on their performance or their usability. However, the need for extra software and electronics is bound to push up the cost of storage, compared to bare drives, and you’ll still have to sacrifice other features you’d get by using a laptop instead.Sanho targets serious amateur and professional photographers with portable backup devices that include a small screen. The HyperDrive Colorspace UDMA3, for example, includes a 160GB hard drive – user-replaceable up to 2TB – and a 3.5in 320 x 480-pixel screen for £379.90. It supports USB3, and a built-in USB-2.0 OTG host enables it to connect directly to some cameras and camcorders. (OTG stands for “on the go”.) Built-in wifi allows connections to smartphones via iOS and Android apps, and to laptops via browsers. Plug it in to your PC’s USB port and it appears as a normal external hard drive.One cheaper alternative is Western Digital’s My Passport Wireless Pro: an external USB3 hard drive with an SD card slot and built-in wifi. WD claims it does “one-touch SD card copy”. It also has a USB2 port that can connect to cameras and other devices (I assume via OTG), and it can create a local hotspot that can support up to eight devices.US prices on WD’s website range from $149.99 for 1TB of storage to $219.99 for 4TB. On Amazon, the 4TB version is the best value: £203.39 at the time of writing. The 1TB model costs £162.10. (US prices don’t include sales taxes UK prices include VAT.)However, the My Passport Wireless Pro has as many one star reviews as five star reviews, and the bad reviews would certainly put me off. As one reviewer says: “Good concept. Implementation less than perfect.”Based on reading a mind-numbing volume of Amazon reviews for numerous products, I think your best bet is Sunvalley’s RAVPower FileHub Plus, which is dead cheap at £39.99. It is not a storage device. It is a wireless travel router, a DLNA-compatible media streamer, and a 6000mAh external battery pack that will recharge your smartphone. All these features could be useful to a caravan family.It also includes an SD card reader, so you could use it to copy an SD card from your camera to your current external hard drive, or other device, without using your laptop. Of course, you will need the smartphone app to run the operation.Have you got a question?

To this day, Wan Chai is a dense assemblage of residential flats, small stores, hole-in-the-wall restaurants and the occasional bar, crammed into just a few streets. We start at Wan Chai’s far western end, by Star Street – an area that’s home to some of the city’s hippest boutiques and eateries. Grab an energising coffee at Elephant Grounds at the entrance to the area, before heading up the hill to explore. Make sure to pop by design store Kapok, which stocks work from some of Hong Kong’s best designers, before swinging by combination art gallery and print shop Odd One Out. Also seek out Lala Curio, hidden away down an alleyway off the main streets. It’s crammed full of whimsical, Chinoiserie-inspired decor, furniture and accessories.We’re heading down the hill and into Wan Chai proper now, turning on to Queen’s Road East: the city’s first ever road, which still snakes along a good portion of the island. The Happy Cake Shop (106 Queen’s Road East) has been baking Hong Kong’s unique buns and cakes since 1979 and there’s always a reassuring queue out the door. Trays of baked goods are regularly brought out from the back, and you’ll want to grab whatever’s piping hot: go for a coconut-filled cocktail bun or a sugar-crusted pineapple bun, which actually contains no pineapple at all. And of course, you can never go wrong with a classic egg custard tart.Further down Queen’s Road, we get to the Hopewell Centre – one of the city’s very first skyscrapers. This cylindrical building contains Hong Kong’s only revolving restaurant, The Grand Buffet but you’re not here for the food: you’re here for the glass observation lift that propels visitors up to the 56th floor. As you ascend, the dense city falls away from you and the harbour pops into view beyond. We follow Queen’s Road again until we arrive at Stone Nullah Lane. A “nullah” is an open storm drain, an Indian word borrowed during colonial times. Thankfully, the nullah has since been covered over, although the name remains. Sitting on the lane is one of the city’s best-preserved pre-war buildings: the Blue House (72 Stone Nullah Lane), so-named for its vibrant hue. This balconied tenement appears just as it would have done when it was built in the 1920s, thanks to restoration efforts that have won it Unesco plaudits. The building was once home to a respected kung fu studio, and the ground floor was occupied by a bone-setting clinic – the traditional Chinese practice that’s a combination of chiropractic and martial arts. Now, the Hong Kong House of Stories on the ground floor hosts small-scale exhibitions. At the top of Stone Nullah Lane, the beautiful Pak Tai Temple sits ensconced in the shade of two enormous banyan trees. It’s the largest temple complex on Hong Kong Island, hidden away among auto repair shops and residential units. Pak Tai is a martial god, responsible for the triumph of good over evil. The temple was built in 1863 but is actually home to a copper statue of the deity that’s more than 250 years older. Make sure to check out the buildings to the side, where some of the temple’s original tiling is preserved.By now you’ll be in need of a restoring drink, and Tai Lung Fung (5-9 Hing Wan Street) has just the thing. This unpretentious bar is steeped in Hong Kong culture, from the distinctly Hong Kong tiling to the old-school memorabilia on the walls – all just the right side of kitsch. Suitably refreshed, we’re heading into the open-air market on Wan Chai Road. The “wet market” – so named for the water spritzed on the vegetables, and the stalls that are hosed down every day – offers a true snapshot of Hong Kong life. Market-goers haggle over the price of bok choy, butchers carve off chunks of pork belly, and chickens are killed and plucked for the freshest possible meal. In among it all are dotted dried seafood stores, eateries and bric-a-brac boutiques.Time for a classic bite in a cha chaan teng. These no-frills eateries – literally “tea restaurants”– grew up around Hong Kong’s industrial boom in the 50s and 60s, serving uniquely Hong Kong cuisine. The 61-year-old Ho Wah Cafe still serves up all the old favourites. Order the house speciality: a toasted corned beef and egg sandwich, washed down with strong, sweet milk tea. Next door to Ho Wah sits the Green House, named for its one-time paint job. This group of 10 prewar tenement buildings has been refurbished (and painted white), reconfigured around a small open square into Comix Home Base, an arts centre for Hong Kong’s comics industry. The space holds regular exhibitions, so there’s always something new to see.Reward your wanderings with a superbly crafted cocktail at The Optimist (239 Hennessy Road), one of the city’s best restaurants. Or if you’re in need of a view, then head across the road to Wooloomooloo Steakhouse, whose rooftop bar offers gob-smacking views of the city from right in the middle of it all. Look over the edge and the roads seem to stretch away far beyond you, orange-lit arteries glowing and blinking as dusk falls on Hong Kong."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca5e88a0988240c99c15e21931af2ffc3b6f0c4f/0_0_4459_2674/master/4459.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86cc6f173852db0f0642e0e199f5894c","title":"sean hannity mueller witnesses bash phones","story":"Mueller had requested some witnesses turn in their phones after suspicion that Manafort used WhatsApp to tamper with witnessesSean Hannity is trying a new tactic in his attempts to derail special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.

He repeatedly attacked Democrats for being weak on national defence for raising privacy concerns about such programmes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1461f6c50b67bd71c1141ec23589b64b22ef5c68/0_218_4682_2810/master/4682.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=190b62cb8a9dac5dc58041af3857968d","title":"all eyes on ramzan kadyrov as chechnya hosts egypt in world cup","story":"Chechen leader is step closer to political goal of being Putin’s link to Middle East with arrival of Egyptian teamThe Tunisians were first to visit, followed by the Iranians, and then the Saudis. But it was the Egyptians, led by the Liverpool superstar Mohamed Salah, who snatched up the dubious grand prize: a World Cup training base in Chechnya. Once devastated by civil war, Chechnya is now the focus of intense international scrutiny over its crackdown on political opponents and gay people in this region in Russia’s North Caucasus. But the controversy did not stop delegations from the Middle East from lining up to tour the stadium that the Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov built and named after his father, the same pitch where he once reviewed more than 20,000 camouflaged soldiers likened to his personal guard. For Kadyrov, who has spent a decade building a pervasive cult of personality at home, playing host to a national side in this year’s World Cup is a step toward his foreign policy ambitions: carving out a niche as Vladimir Putin’s envoy to the Middle East and the de facto voice of Russian Muslims abroad.“We all know that our leader has a good relationship with Saudi kings, with princes, with the leadership of Egypt. We are happy Egypt has made the choice to come to us,” said Magomed Matsuev, the stadium’s director, sitting in his office under a portrait of Kadyrov and his father, Akhmad.Matsuev once hoped to see Grozny named a World Cup host city, and in 2012 went so far as to bring down executives from the British architects KSS and engineers Mott MacDonald to consider a stadium expansion. But politics got in the way, he says, and Grozny was passed over.Now, hosting a national team with a megastar like Salah, a world-famous Muslim footballer who celebrates each goal in a display of faith, has provided some consolation.“Through football, we are going to show that we are developing, not going backward like the press says, trying to reignite old hatreds through disinformation,” Matsuev said.Not far from the polished downtown, the Egyptian team, which arrives on Sunday, will be staying at a new luxury hotel built with investment from Dubai. Egyptian players will break the Ramadan fast with halal cuisine in a region where Kadyrov has made alcohol scarce, a pocket of Islamic worship in a country better known for a tradition of Orthodoxy or atheism.This is the Chechnya built by Kadyrov, a 41-year-old gym fanatic who has become one of Russia’s most effective, and brutal, politicians. The former rebel turned satrap was given carte blanche to quell the region’s simmering Islamic insurgency after his father, the former president, was assassinated in a bomb blast in 2004. Kadyrov has wielded faith as a tool to remake Chechnya, empowering loyal religious leaders and a local Sufi-infused Islam to cement his control. His religious fervour has sometimes veered into the bizarre: In 2015, he claimed to have received a blood transfusion from a descendant of the prophet Muhammad and said it had made him “the happiest man on earth”.“Islam has been a brilliant tool for Ramzan Kadyrov,” said Grigory Shvedov, the editor of Caucasian Knot, one of the few independent news agencies focusing on Russia’s North Caucasus region. By using his faith, “he can sometimes do more than laws in Russia may allow and remain legitimate in the eyes of his population”.With his power secure at home, Kadyrov has increasingly staked out a position as a defender of the faith outside of Chechnya. In Russia, Kadyrov has organised public protests against cartoons of the prophet Muhammad in Charlie Hebdo and the persecution of Muslims in Myanmar. He has sent military police to Syria and taken in the wives and children of Islamic State fighters returning from Syria.To some degree, Kadyrov has set out to fulfill his father’s prophecy that Chechnya would become “the link tying Russia to Saudi Arabia”.For the Kremlin, Kadyrov is an important envoy to repair decades of bad blood with the Gulf, a region that has traditionally kept close ties with Washington and seen relations further fray with Moscow during the conflict in Syria. One Russian diplomat compared Kadyrov’s role to an “advance man”, noting that his meetings were a way for the Kremlin to establish contact without holding formal talks.When Saudi Arabia’s King Salman visited the Kremlin in 2017 for a state visit, the first by a Saudi monarch, Kadyrov was there.Kadyrov “is very much needed as a person in the Middle East who can show that there is a country that won’t listen to Washington and won’t be scared by sanctions”, said Shvedov.There have been missteps as Kadyrov has attempted to establish religious authority. A 2016 conference of religious scholars in Chechnya ended in controversy after a fatwa was issued condemning Salafism, a branch of Sunni Islam widespread in Saudi Arabia. Media outlets in Saudi Arabia and the UAE later reported that Kadyrov travelled to Saudi Arabia to apologise in person to the crown prince, although Chechen officials deny that.Observers of Chechnya note that while Kadyrov’s interests often dovetail with the Kremlin’s, a leading motivation is to ensure continuing streams of funding to Grozny. “Kadyrov understands he is needed and he shows that he needs to be paid,” said Shvedov, noting Kadyrov’s aggressive lobbying from Moscow on behalf of the region’s budget. “And when he is not properly paid inside of the country, he might pursue his own deals and interests.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7fc09921ee388e23f8ecd15928a32311a44e0eb/0_251_4147_2488/master/4147.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b0ffe800e0a173eb0aa99df4d706555","title":"fresh free and beautiful the rise of urban gardening","story":"How an urban farms project in Dallas and a fellowship garden in Connecticut are helping their communitiesby  Rachel Obordo and   readersHow an urban farms project in Dallas and a fellowship garden in Connecticut are helping their communitiesby  Rachel Obordo and   readersIn Dallas, Texas, in an area designated as a food desert, meaning access to fresh fruit and vegetables is difficult, Big Tex urban farms have donated 85,000 servings of fruit and vegetables to the community since 2016.Developed for and funded by the annual Texas state fair, the project consists of mobile beds in car parks and a hydroponic greenhouse which allow plants to grow without soil. “The majority of the population in this area relies on small corner stores that do not provide access to quality produce or healthy foods,” said Jason Hays, the fair’s creative director. “Access to modern grocery stores can be inhibited due to pricing, transportation and education. The city tried to lure a large grocer with financial incentives but had no luck. “Access to fresh food options can have a profound effect on the health and wellbeing of iniduals, which can transform communities. I believe everyone should have equal access to healthy options as well as education to improve eating habits.”One recipient, Glenda Cunningham, of the Baylor Scott and White health and wellness centre, praised the project’s work. “The community looks forward to the Big Tex urban farm delivery each week. The food is fresh, free and beautiful,” she said.In Orange, Connecticut, the food production company Watson’s fellowship garden has been running for four years. The company grows produce for food banks and had extra space available, so it decided to expand and has opened its garden to a centre helping children with autism spectrum issues. Christina Cole, 47, a graphic designer at Watson, said: “The plot for Milestones Behavioural Services, which includes a pumpkin and melon patch, gives kids with autism and developmental disabilities the chance to not only have fun and be outside, but also learn life skills and take home what they grow and learn to cook with their families. With the garden season kicking in, we’re getting ready to put in a corn maze.”According to the Connecticut food bank, one in eight people in the state struggle with hunger. “We feel no one should have to think about where their next meal is coming from,” Cole said.The company provides 4,800 plants each year, and those not used are donated to the food bank for use in its gardens. Watson hopes the garden will not only help children but also address food insecurity facing older generations. “Those who are elderly and on a low income used to get vouchers from the state to access fresh fruit and vegetables, but the programme has been cut due to a lack of funding. With our garden we hope to work with the community and help with such issues. Everyone should have access to food, much less something fresh,” Cole said.She said shops were willing to donate food in West Haven but did not have the resources to do so. “I’m in the process of trying to organise the logistics of starting runners to help businesses get food to those who need it most. We’re hoping it will help reduce food waste in the area.” Rose Majestic, the executive director of Wheat, which provides food to people in crisis, said: “The people who comes to us can’t afford fresh produce so Watson’s weekly deliveries go a long way in helping them. We hope other businesses that have yards that can be dug up and used for feeding the hungry in our community start to do the same.”Watson is hosting an event in June to try to get local businesses to start their own community food-growing projects. “In light of the world nowadays, we should all get back to learning to grow our own food. It is the essential basis for survival. It can only further us all to know how to feed ourselves healthily and it’s a great help to have an alternative food source for our neighbours.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theThis article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

The ICRC said it could only continue its operations in Yemen if it had the full agreement of all parties to the conflict. An ICRC employee, a Lebanese national, was killed on 21 April when an unknown gunman opened fire on the man’s car in the south-western city of Taiz. Stillhart said: “While the Yemen delegation has received numerous threats in the past, we cannot now accept additional risk less than two months after a gunman killed a staff member. “The security of our staff, who are being intimidated by parties to the conflict, is a non-negotiable prerequisite for our presence and work in Yemen and an absolute priority.”The new UN special envoy, Martin Griffiths, is due to publish the outlines of a peace plan in two weeks in which all warring sides will be asked to lay down arms and work towards a joint government. The ICRC said it had worked in Yemen for more than five decades to help victims of armed conflict and violence, including displaced people, families of the missing, detainees, mine victims, and those in need of healthcare in Sana’a, Aden, Taiz, Sa’ada and Hodeidah.

Photograph: iStockphotoThere were no surprises in this morning’s Junior Cert Paper 1 in Irish which was described by teachers as being “very much in line” with previous years.The two-hour paper is broken into three sections and the composite parts of the paper are the cluastuiscint (listening comprehensionl), an léamhthuiscint (comprehension), trialacha teanga comhthéacsúla (contextual language test) and ceapadóireacht (composition).Teacher Ruth Morrissey of St Michael’s Community College in Kilmihil, Co Clare said the exam contained: “nothing that they wouldn’t have prepared for and there was nothing unexpected on the paper.”“I think it was very encouraging. A lot of students can be nervous going in in the morning. But no, everyone came out and was saying ‘I’m glad I stuck with the honours’”.The reaction to the listening comprehension was mixed. Teacher Robbie Cronin of Marian College, Ballsbridge, in Dublin, said some students found they did not have enough time for this section of the exam.“The old chestnut of the listening comprehension comes back again. Students of Irish hear the pieces only twice, as distinct from the other modern languages which are heard three times. “My students said that they felt they hadn’t enough time to write down the answers. The píosa nuachta , which dealt with a student winning young scientist award, proved particularly difficult in this regard.” Students at St Michael’s Community College were happy with the dialects heard in the aural. “Sometimes there is an issue with different dialects but they found it very straight-forward and very clear this year in comparison with previous years,” Ms Morrissey said. The questions asked about the cluastuiscint were “very much in line with previous years,” she added. Commenting on the rest of the paper, Ms Morrissey said students would have been familiar with Dialann Dúradán (Diary of a Wimpy Kid), which came up, while the questions on an Chathair Ghlas (the world’s first forest city being built in southern China) might have been more difficult “as some of the vocabulary might be more challenging”. She added that the questions in this section were seen as “very fair” by her students.In the section on grammar, candidates were asked to show their knowledge about the aimsir chaite (past tense). They were asked rewrite a piece of text in the past tense describing the launch of a CD last year by TV personality Eoin McDermott in association with Conradh na Gaeilge and Raidió Rí-Rá. “It was great to see something modern and up-top-date,” said Ms Morrissey. “He is someone the students would be very much familiar with. They were happy enough with the grammar.”Analysing the final writing section in which students were asked to write an essay, compose a story or outline an argument one would make during a debate, Ms Morrissey said: “It allowed a well-prepared student the scope to really show off their grammar and vocabulary” Overall, students were happy with Paper 1. “It was very fair. A lot of them were very happy coming out of the paper, so fingers crossed for the afternoon paper,” she said.“I thought it was well put together. I think seeing more modern stuff come up in an Irish paper is always going to be welcomed by teachers. There is this old perception that it is old-fashioned but seeing these come in during the current climate is welcome.”The reading comprehension on the Ordinary Level paper “were good if a bit dated,” said Mr Cronin. One piece of text referred in the future tense to concerts to be played by Ed Sheeran despite that they took place in early May.A piece of text on GAA star Ríona Ní Bhuachalla, “although a good article, missed that she has just retired from intercounty,” said Mr Cronin.Mr Cronin said the graphics in the written section (6a) where students were asked to write a letter about their dog “seemed childish”. He pointed out a grammatical error in question 5 where the words i dteach “mo chara” should instead be i dteach “mo charad”.He said it was “disappointing to have a grammatical mistake so prominently shown”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3520544.1528231703!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"kinahan gang member s shadow hangs over irish boxing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Katie Taylor with her father Pete Taylor (left): home town fight was deemed impossible  due to security issues around boxing. Photograph: Aidan CrawleyThe shadows cast on Irish boxing by the Regency Hotel gangland shooting more than two years ago have never faded. In the wake of Tuesday’s shooting, those shadows are now even longer.David Byrne was shot dead in the foyer of the Dublin northside hotel on February 5th, 2016. Patrick Hutch (25) subsequently pleaded not guilty to his murder.The boxing event was hosted by MTK, the Marbella-based boxing outfit co-founded six years ago by Daniel Kinahan, a leading member of the Kinahan crime gang.Last January, two people were shot and injured outside the National Stadium on Dublin’s South Circular Road, where an under-age amateur boxing event was being staged.One, a man in his 40s was known to gardaí. The second, a student in his 20s and not linked to crime in any way, was caught in the crossfire. The intended target fled down the South Circular Road towards Griffith College. A boxing event, featuring five of MTK’s boxers, listed for the Citywest Hotel just a few days afterwards was cancelled when the hotel pulled out on security grounds.Shortly after Citywest’s decision to cancel, MTK Global said it was quitting Ireland because the Irish media had repeatedly slandered and vilified it and its stable of professional boxers. In a statement, Sandra Vaughan, the chief executive and sole shareholder of MTK Global, distanced herself and MTK from Kinahan, saying all ties with him had been cut since February 2017 after a management buy-in.“This witch hunt by Irish media has left me with no choice but for MTK Global to pull out of the Republic of Ireland for the immediate future. We will not host fight nights in Dublin nor will any MTK Global athletes fight on a Dublin card.” In July 2017, it was reported that several MTK boxers were training at Bray Boxing Club, the club run by Pete Taylor, the father of Olympic boxing champion Katie Taylor. However, his daughter, who has since gone on to win International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Association titles, no longer trains there. She spends most of her time based in the USA, near Hartford, Connecticut. The three MTK boxers were heavyweight Sean Turner, a new professional Gary Cully and Irish amateur champion David Oliver Joyce, who competed on the same boxing team as Katie in the Rio Olympics in 2016. Speaking at the time, Pete Taylor explained he was coaching the three boxers for no payment, partly because he knew Joyce from amateur boxing. “It’s my club. I own it. “I can train who I want. It’s all boxing,” he told a Sunday newspaper. There is no suggestion that Pete Taylor or any of the boxers he coached in Bray were connected with crime.Last month, Katie Taylor’s manager, Brian Peters, during a press conference in Meath, was asked if the popular 31-year-old Olympic champion could look forward to a home town fight.He would say no more, though he was questioned on whether it was off the agenda because of concerns about security at boxing events because of Daniel Kinahan’s known interest in boxing.“I’m not sure,” he replied. “If you want to run a show, there are sanctioning bodies, the gardaí . . . there are a whole load of boxes you have to tick to put on a show.”"},{"url":null,"title":"magdalene woman we were slaves to the nuns and the church but no more","story":"  June 5, 2018First time for many to speak freely to other women incarcerated in the laundries   June 5, 2018When I first met her she doubted justice would ever come her way-not from the Good Shepherd Sisters and not from the Irish State   June 5, 2018President apologises at \u0026Aacuteras reception to women who worked in laundries   June 5, 2018Banquet held in Dublin\u0026rsquos Mansion House for some 230 people incarcerated in laundries "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3523224.1528413505!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ex dup leader suggests fixed generational polls on irish unity","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer first minister Peter Robinson  said he did not believe the DUP was being hypocritical when it said Northern Ireland must be ‘in lockstep’ with Britain when it came to Brexit but not on certain social issues. Photograph: PA WireFormer Democratic Unionist leader Peter Robinson has suggested holding fixed generational polls on Irish unification as a way to stabilise politics in Northern Ireland.The ex-Stormont first minister said the approach would help make the constitutional question less disruptive to local politics and the prospect of a referendum less threatening.Delivering a lecture at Queen’s University in Belfast, veteran unionist Mr Robinson stressed he would be very confident that citizens would choose to stay within the United Kingdom. But, reflecting on the discordant aftermath of the Brexit vote, he said the prospect of a simple yesno poll to deal with a “colossal constitutional change”, and which could be carried with a majority of just one vote, was a “recipe for chaos” on the island.As such, he said there was a need for processes and timescales to be agreed in advance, rather than having to “tackle the issue on the fly” if unification was ever backed. “In this I am not, of course, talking about the nature and shape of the new state that would emerge if there ever was a vote to exit the UK,” he said. “I am alluding to the need to agree a process for negotiations, timescales and not only the means of reaching agreement on all the particulars but also who would be involved in negotiating such an agreement.“With those details settled, my own view, for what it’s worth, is that fixed generational border polls would be less isive and disruptive of our local political process.”Mr Robinson acknowledged he had “pulled the pin out of the grenade” with his remarks.The 1998 Belfast Agreement allows for a border poll on Irish unity to be held no more than every seven years but the document is ambiguous on when exactly it should be called.Explaining what he meant by “fixed generation”, Mr Robinson said any such poll should not be “on the whim of a Secretary of State, or on the demand of a political party”. In addition, it “should be sufficiently far ahead so that we have stable government in between”.The main focus of Mr Robinson’s lecture at Queen’s was his reflections on how to restore a stable powersharing administration. The former first minister, who was recently appointed an honorary professor of peace studies at the institution, warned that community ision in the region was “accelerating” and suggested violence could reignite if the political stagnation continued.“We are at risk of awaking the slumbering hostilities that we had all hoped would never again be aroused,” he said.Addressing an audience that included current DUP leader Arlene Foster, Mr Robinson said the most recent set of failed negotiations to resurrect Stormont ended in a “train crash”.In an apparent challenge to the current generation of leaders, Mr Robinson said: “Let’s be clear, not all of your colleagues, will want to make the necessary concessions... That’s where leadership comes in.”Speaking to The  ahead of the lecture on current controversies, Mr Robinson said he always has been “pro life” on the issue of abortion. And he rejected the suggestion that British and Irish citizens in Northern Ireland were being discriminated against by not having civil marriage equality, and abortion services that were available in Scotland, England and Wales, and soon the Republic of Ireland.He said he did not believe the DUP was being hypocritical when it said Northern Ireland must be “in lockstep” with Britain when it came to Brexit but not on these social issues.“No, it is a recognition that Brexit comes into a constitutional issue which his of course a matter for the United Kingdom as a whole,” he said. “The social issues are not constitutional matters.” In advance of his lecture, dozens of academics complained to the university about Mr Robinson’s appointment as a honorary professor of peace studies. Professor Emeritus Phil Scraton, Dr Marie Coleman, Professor Peter Gray and Dr Emma Reisz are among 37 academics who claim, in a letter, that the appointment is “weaving hostility to LGBT+ and Muslim staff and students into the fabric of the university”. This relates to comments made in the past by the former politician about the LGBT and Islamic communities. A QUB statement said it was “committed to the promotion of equality and ersity” and anyone who had raised concerns about an appointment could raise it with a member of the university’s honorary titles group. - Additional reporting PA-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord it took 35 years to build this stunning result","story":"Thirty-five years after it was placed into the Constitution, the electorate voted for the Eighth Amendment to be repealed and for provision be made for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day.

Photograph: Robbie ReynoldsThis time last year Leo Varadkar was in the middle of his interregnum. He was Taoiseach-elect but, like a half-finished fitted kitchen, not fully installed. It took a run to the Phoenix Park and the collection of his warrant of appointment to seal the deal, but another run to the Park the day before rather took the gloss off young Leo’s coronation.Remember when Enda Kenny decided his last act as taoiseach would be to assist his outgoing attorney general into a nice job in the Court of Criminal Appeal, via a last-minute dash to Áras an Uachtaráin? It walked the new Taoiseach straight into a monumental row about judicial appointments and him barely a day in office.A year on from those exciting, promise-filled interregnum days, before real life immediately intruded, Leo was back in the Phoenix Park again. The sun was shining, the flowers blooming and the only thing on the Taoiseach’s mind was making sure we all eat enough roughage and go for regular walks with our best pals. “It’s called the buddy concept,” he declared, as Simon Harris simpered gamely beside him. Since the abortion referendum, the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach have been running an awkward three-legged race together – neither, one suspects, that delighted to be shackled to the other. The pair were together again on Thursday morning for the launch of the Healthy Ireland summer campaign, which aims to get people thinking and acting positively about their health. Healthy Ireland – or “Hi” according to the logo – wants us to “walk with friends” and “feel good together” and encourage each other to take the first steps towards a better lifestyle. The launch was in the very lovely Phoenix Cafe in the park’s visitor centre near Ashtown Gate. Or “in my constituency”, as Leo put it. There was a very nice breakfast spread laid on in the courtyard, with not a rasher or sausage in sight and pomegranate seeds sparkling like little rubies on all manner of nutritious treats. We got stuck in to the apricot and coconut energy balls and didn’t feel in the least bit embarrassed when mistaking the gussied-up oats for a bowl of hummus. Little steps, after all, as Minister of State in charge of health promotion, Catherine Byrne, pointed out. “Hi” also wants us to “Share Some Fruit”. So buddies Leo and Simon, along with Catherine, strolled into the Victorian walled garden, where the herbaceous borders are a joy to behold, and prepared for the sharing of the fruit and the taking of the snaps. They were joined by a party of schoolchildren. “Give some fruit to the children!” roared the photographers as the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health posed in front of a stall heavily laden with the most wonderful selection of fruit and veg. “Will yis feed the children!”Simon began handing out cherries. “Here ya go. Have a cherry. Lots of cherries. You can have all the cherries.”Leo gingerly plucked at an apple and held it at a child. We were glad it wasn’t a sharp sort of fruit. The Taoiseach could have taken a child’s eye out with a conference pear. Simon held an apple in one hand and a pear in the other. So Leo held a plum tomato like it was red cricket ball, tossing it the air again and again the way cricketers do.The photographers weren’t happy, but their subjects were. Both men without their suit jackets and their sleeves rolled up – the favourite mode of dress for politicians in the field.“Can we have yis hold up a piece of fruit?” came the latest demand. Leo picked up a strawberry. “Hold up bigger pieces. No. Bigger pieces!” implored the snappers, staring pointedly at a large bunch of bananas. The Taoiseach eyed it up, muttered something to the Minister for Health along the lines of “no bananas” and the two of them laughed and steered well clear. Probably for the best.Then they answered some questions about Brexit and Leo’s visit to Belfast on Friday. He will visit the headquarters of the Orange Order and open the annual Féile an Phobail in west Belfast – a decision that has been criticised in some quarters in the North.“Arlene Foster has spoken at it in the past. I believe the headline act this year is Olly Murs – I don’t think anyone could accuse him of being a diehard republican, so it is very much a community event and I’m very honoured at being asked.” Meanwhile, back at the launch, he gave the audience a potted history of the Phoenix Park and told them they were in a building “which used to be the home of the papal nuncio”. The nunciature is now located nearby on the Navan Road “but is no longer the centre of affairs in the way the Vatican was in the past”.Simon Harris then admitted to being “useless at sport” while the Taoiseach – probably raging his handlers wouldn’t let him wear his running shorts and singlet – smirked beside him. As they left, a number of members of the Dublin Phoenix Nordic Walking Club approached, looking like they were about to attack them with trekking poles. But no, Mary Savage, Patricia Murphy and Freda Kerr were keen to congratulate the two men on the part they played in the recent referendum campaign.“I just wanted to be able to thank them for what they did for women,” said Mary.A nice way for Leo to mark the anniversary of his interregnum.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3523237.1528403868!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"q a on brexit so what did london propose","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUK Brexit secretary David Davis, a hard Brexiteer who threatened resignation if the backstop was not time-limited. Photograph: Will OliverEPASo what this latest thing to have happened in all this Brexit business?After months of awaiting a British response to the EU’s draft proposal around the “backstop” solution – a default plan to avoid a hard border in Ireland post-Brexit – London has suggested its own version of the plan.Wait, what’s the backstop again?To maintain an invisible border, the EU and UK agreed in a political deal last December that if they had not agreed a trade deal post-Brexit or other specific solution for the Border, then there should be a backstop maintaining regulatory alignment North and South to avoid customs checks.Where does the Government stand on this?Dublin is pushing hard for the backstop because, in the absence of a long-term trade deal (which will take years to negotiate) and an alternative solution (several of which have been suggested by the UK and rejected by the EU), this fall-back solution effectively maintains the status quo on the island of Ireland post-Brexit.Did the UK approve of the EU’s suggested backstop?Even though it agreed in principle to a backstop, London said that it could not agree to the EU’s proposed backstop because alignment would only apply to Northern Ireland and in effect establish a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. This caused alarm among the Democratic Unionist Party whose support is keeping Theresa May and her Conservative Party in power in the House of Commons.The UK government has formally proposed the idea a “temporary customs arrangement” in a government paper that would apply to the UK as a whole, keeping the entire country in the EU customs union in the event of a failure to reach a deal on customs arrangements with the EU.This backstop would, crucially for ardent Brexit supporters in May’s government and party, be limited in time. It would continue beyond the proposed Brexit transition period, when EU and UK will remain aligned, from the UK’s formal departure in March 2019 until December 2020. This would maintain frictionless trade between the EU and the UK and eliminate tariffs, quotas and customs processes on all EU-UK trade.So how long would this time-limited backstop last?May’s government has said the time-limited backstop will only apply, should it be needed, until a permanent customs arrangement is introduced and that it “expects” this to be in place by the end of 2021.“Expects”? But what if the permanent plan is not in place by then?That is where things get complicated, not just for the upcoming negotiations around whether the two sides can meet somewhere in the middle in time for a summit of EU leaders at the end of this month.This is not a guaranteed cut-off date and the EU would likely reject that because it is temporary in nature, does not protect the EU single market and customs union, and because Brussels had rejected the idea of allowing the backstop to apply to the UK as a whole. But the fudged position keeps the Brexiteers happy because it ensures that the UK will not have indefinite membership of the EU customs union.Why this time-limited backstop?The temporary measure was agreed as a concession by May to quell a cabinet revolt by UK Brexit secretary David Davis, a hard Brexiteer who threatened resignation if it was not time-limited.What does the Irish Government think of the UK proposal?It welcomed the fact the UK has proposed something but it is still assessing it. Prior to the proposal, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar rejected the idea of a time-limited version of the post-Brexit backstop arrangement because, he said, the whole idea of a backstop was that it should apply until there is an alternative in place that maintains a frictionless, invisible border on the island. It should be an “all-weather” backstop, he said.So what next?The formal response of the EU’s Brexit “task force” team of negotiators is awaited.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3523116.1528409998!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"some brexit progress but big questions remain in london","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tObservers of Theresa May’s management of Brexit might raise some questions about the details and progress made.

When Wonka puts the giant machine into operation, a tremendous whirring and banging begins, as ingredients disappear into funnels for processing steam rises, levers extend and withdraw, wheels turn eventually this great cacophony of industry and activity produces a small piece of gum. “Is that it?” asks Violet Beauregarde.Observers of Theresa May’s management of Brexit might feel some affinity for Ms Beauregarde. A great deal of political huffing and puffing, of threats and brinkmanship and arm-twisting and compromise, preceded today’s publication of the latest British proposals on Brexit. And all around Europe, the response has echoed the unfortunate Violet: “Is that it?”“All weather” is the new buzzphrase in the Brexit negotiations about the backstop, and means that it must be effective in both the good weather of an agreed EU-UK solution to the Border, but also in the bad weather of no agreement.Nowhere is the Brexit weather watched more closely than in Dublin, where officials were poring over the British draft yesterday, flashing instant assessments and reactions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, who is in the Middle East for a three-day visit. Coveney’s initial statement was cool, with no sign of a welcome. He stressed the need for “substantial progress” on the backstop in advance of the summit in Brussels at the end of this month. Officials in Dublin pointed out the obvious holes in the British document – it’s silent on the single market, silent on regulatory alignment, silent on the role of the European Court of Justice, and there is little detail on how the British proposals for remaining in the customs union but still agreeing trade deals with third countries would actually work. But actually there were some pluses for Dublin in the document. The prospect of long-term customs union membership, or at least equivalence, doesn’t just solve Dublin’s North-South problem, but also its East-West one. Crucially, the time limit to the backstop in the document, much heralded by the British media, is actually aspirational. The backstop only ends in 2021 if there’s something better in place. There’s plenty of scepticism about the document in Dublin and Brussels. But at the same time, officials were keen to acknowledge that it represents progress, and a willingness to engage. Yesterday’s document doesn’t of itself constitute “sufficient progress” – and in truth, the timelines in advance of the summit don’t allow for much more progress to be made – but there appears to be little appetite in Dublin or elsewhere for a showdown in Brussels in three weeks time. Better to keep the show on the road, many think, on the basis that at every stage, the British have more or less acceded to the EU position in the end.One of the great frustrations that Dublin and Brussels have with London in this process is that it takes so long, and requires so much effort in London to achieve so little progress.But the EU can handle that. Painstaking negotiations, institutional design, incremental progress – this is what the EU does. The question is whether Mrs May can handle it. As ever in Brexit, the European side is pretty transparent on what it will and won’t do. The real questions remain in London.

File photograph: Eric LukeThe mapping of DNA from some of the settlers who colonised Iceland more than 1,000 years ago offers an insight into the fate of thousands of slaves – mostly women – who were taken by Norse Vikings from Ireland and Scotland before they put down roots on the North Atlantic island.Anthropologist Sunna Ebenesersdóttir, of the University of Iceland and the company deCODE Genetics in Reykjavik, analysed the genomes of 25 ancient Icelanders whose skeletal remains were found in burial sites across the island. Sequencing using samples from teeth revealed the settlers had a roughly even split of Norse (from what are today Norway and Sweden) and Gaelic ancestry. It is the first in-depth investigation of how a new population is formed through a genetic process known as “admixture”.When the researchers compared the ancient genomes to those of modern people in Iceland and other European countries, they found contemporary Icelanders, on average, draw about 70 per cent of their genes from Norse ancestry. This suggests that in the 1,100 years between settlement and today, the population underwent a surprisingly quick genetic shift in favour of Norse genes, the researchers report in the journal Science.They confirm that while the ancient settlers, “mainly Norse men and Gaelic women”, are genetically indistinguishable from present-day Irish, Scots and Scandinavians, present-day Icelanders have over the course of 1,000 years, and numerous population bottlenecks, become a distinct new population. “Repeated famines and epidemics led to a substantial loss of sequence ersity from the Icelandic gene pool, causing it to drift away from its source populations in Scandinavia and the British-Irish Isles,” explained Kári Stefánsson, deCODE chief executive and co-author on the paper. Another possibility, he suggested, is that ancient Icelanders with more Norse ancestry held a slight edge in reproductive success over those with Gaelic ancestry, many of whom were enslaved when they came to the island.The Celts were often buried in unmarked graves though, intriguingly, a minority were buried in the traditional Viking way, with their sword and boat.On the study, he added: “This is a fascinating example of how a population is shaped by its environment, in this case the harsh and marginal conditions of medieval Iceland. “It is also another demonstration of how our small but well characterised population can continue to make important contributions to understanding the fundamental genetic and evolutionary processes that shape our species.”Their next step is to expand sample size, and to examine how diseases affected the population.

The UK is clear that the future customs arrangement needs to deliver on the commitments made in relation to Northern Ireland. The UK expects the future arrangement to be in place by the end of December 2021 at the latest. There are a range of options for how a time limit could be delivered, which the UK will propose and discuss with the EU,” it says.Last March, British and EU negotiators agreed that the backstop should apply “unless and until another solution is found” to avoid a hard Border in Ireland. Ms May’s official spokesperson said on Thursday that the new proposal is consistent with that commitment.The document’s publication was delayed by a dispute between the prime minister and her Brexit secretary, David Davis, who insisted that it should specify the date on which the backstop would end. Ms May held separate meetings on Thursday morning with Mr Davis and two other Brexiteer ministers, foreign secretary Boris Johnson and international trade secretary Liam Fox. Amid reports that Mr Davis threatened to resign from the cabinet, he met the prime minister for a second time on Wednesday before the document was published.Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said it had been another embarrassing day for the Conservative government over Brexit.“The clock is ticking on the Brexit process and it is imperative that an agreement is struck which will protect jobs, the economy and ensure there is no hard border in Northern Ireland. Instead, with the threat of a Cabinet resignation, Theresa May has signed up to a flawed proposal which is inconsistent with her earlier commitments,” he said.The EU published a draft version of the backstop last March which referred only to Northern Ireland being considered part of the EU customs territory after Brexit. The British proposal says that the whole of the United Kingdom will be considered part of the EU customs area as long as the backstop is in force.The document says that Britain would continue to apply the EU’s common external tariff but would be able to negotiate and sign new trade deals, “and implement those elements that do not affect the functioning of the temporary customs arrangement”.It acknowledges that a backstop arrangement will require an agreement on regulatory standards which will have to be addressed elsewhere.Meanwhile, British foreign secretary Boris Johnson has claimed the debate about solutions to the Border post-Brexit had been “blown completely out of proportion”.“It’s so small and there are so few firms that actually use that border regularly, it’s just beyond belief that we’re allowing the tail to wag the dog in this way,” he told party colleagues, according to an audio recording obtained by BuzzFeed News. “We’re allowing the whole of our agenda to be dictated by this folly.”Mr Johnson claimed a solution that allowed for trade with “our continental friends and partners” that was “as frictionless as possible” could be found easily.Earlier, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said Ireland cannot agree to a time-limited version of a post-Brexit backstop arrangement .“The principle that is in the existing backstop that is supported by the 27 EU member states is that it applies at least until there is an alternative in place,” Mr Varadkar told reporters before the British government published its proposals. “It is not something that can be just time-limited.“It has to be as they say ‘all weather’, it has to be applicable until such a time if and when there is a new relationship between the EU and UK that prevents a hard border.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"city highlights fromnational geographic travel photographer","story":"This is a selection of images from the National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year Contest which is open for entries until May 31, 2018.The Scenic Suitcase taken by Stephanie MillerThe colorful streets of Bo Kaap weren\u0027t always this way.

We didn’t necessarily realise that what we were creating was pioneering, we were simply too busy relishing all the opportunities and embracing the results before rushing on to the next challenge!The Butterick patterns allowed dressmakers on a budget to make Mary Quant\u0026#39s designs Friends have been extremely generous in loaning, and in many cases, donating garments and accessories to the V\u0026ampA which they have lovingly cherished for many years, so it will be fascinating to see what else will emerge! “I am enormously grateful to have been involved with so many talented people whose contribution to that ground-breaking, revolutionary and memorable era will also be recognised.”Curators have asked women across the country to help uncover the lost designs from hot pants, miniskirts and trousers for women to swimwear, accessories, tights and make-up.The most coveted missing items from the exhibition include one-off pieces from her famous Bazaar boutiques, as well as experimental PVC designs, and swimwear. Those who could not afford to buy her clothes could still be included the museum wants examples of home dressmakers who used the designer\u0027s patterns.The fashion guru defined the fashion of a generationOpening in April 2019, the exhibition will focus on the years between 1955 and 1975, when the designer revolutionised the high street with her subversive and playful designs for a younger generation.Specialist curator Jenny Lister said she was looking for the stories behind the clothes, which were worn by fashionable women of all incomes and backgrounds. She told The : “We are really looking for stories behind the designs. We\u0027ve had a lovely collection of clothes from a lady who lived in Malaysia in the early ‘60s with her husband and bought things through mail order from the shop in Kings Road and shocked everyone in Malaysia where she lived with the striking new designs. The window of one of Mary Quant\u0026#39s Bazaar shops. She is looking for clothing from the shops to use in the exhibition“We have also had a dress that someone bought by saving up from her holiday job, and talked to ladies who have worked for Mary Quant and have a dress which was worn to an interview at the shop on Kings Road.”The story of Mary Quant is particularly relevant to young women today, Ms Lister said, explaining: “People would really connect with that story today - she really opened that field for people to start a career in fashion. She spoke to students at the Royal College of Art and showed you could make a sucesssful business out of fashion. She helped the British export campaign and became the face of swinging London.“The way people use digital media now is the same as the opportunities hat Mary and her team were taking advantage of by using the new, emerging magazine industry for young women..They were very forward-thinking in using new models, young models and broke the mould for fashion.”A decade before Biba stormed onto the fashion scene, Mary Quant’s Bazaar boutique began to blow away the fashion cobwebs and usher in a style movement which, arguably, we’re still enjoying today her quote that ‘a woman is as young as her knees’ has never rung so true (just ask Brigitte Macron).The King’s road store which Quant and her husband-to-be Alexander Plunket Greene opened in 1955 became a hub for the youthquake which was beginning to sweep London.The shop was run in a way some would still consider revolutionary now, staying opening late for parties and becoming a hub where you went as much to show off your new outfit as to purchase it- many must now be buried away in attics waiting to be rediscovered.Quant’s name has often been placed beside those of the great Parisian couturiers- and debate ensues to this day about whether it was her, fellow Brit Jean Varon or André Courrèges who initiated the idea of the mini skirt- but her approach was different and she wanted her refreshingly modern aesthetic to be accessible to everyone, including the girls admiring photos of Twiggy or Jean Shrimpton in her designs.To that end, Quant began a diffusion line called Ginger Group and made her pieces available as Butterick patterns so that they could be run up on sewing machines in homes across the country.Now the V\u0026ampA wants to see the fruits of Quant fans’ creativity.It wasn’t just Quant’s mini skirts which represented a revolutionary new take on women’s style she ushered in the use of unexpected, daring fabrics and details which adjusted all expectations of how clothes should look. It was perhaps 1963’s ‘Wet’ collection which was the most seminal of these, using PVC, which was then in its early development, to create slick raincoats, skirt suits and hats which nodded to the space-age style which Parisian designers like Paco Rabanne and Courreges were also exploring. John Lennon’s wife Cynthia was amongst the early adopters of the look.As well as masterminding new items for a new generation of women with a carefree, youthful approach to their wardrobes, Mary Quant reframed old favourites.Take the Peter Pan collar which had previously been associated with polite femininity.In Quant’s hands, it became a graphic addition to sleek shift dresses and colourful blouses.The mid-Sixties were the height of Swinging London and Quant’s place at its epicentre so it’s perhaps understandable that the popular Peter Pan-collared designs were not saved for the Quant archives, instead making their way onto the backs of cool girls across the capital.Knits, swimwear and accessories: the full wardrobeMary Quant replaced elegance and politesse with edginess, daring and run-for-a-bus-ability, not just in skirts and dresses, but plenty of other wardrobe essentials, too.The V\u0026ampA is calling on women to dig out Mary Quant shoes, knits or swimwear which they might have purchased to get the full Quant ‘look’.Her most famous footwear includes colourful pixie boots, flower-splashed block heels and pop art Mondrian-inspired boots (Yves Saint Laurent also created a Mondrian dress in 1965).Meanwhile, bikinis were skimpy and brightly printed and knitwear was less cosy, more a vehicle for abstract patterns.Royal College of ArtVictoria and Albert

colds adenoids surgery childhood allergies asthma","story":"Study found heightened susceptibility to 28 different types of disease, including parasitic infections, skin ailments and eye complaintsHaving your tonsils out as a child makes you three times as likely to suffer from common colds and other respiratory infections, and may leave you more vulnerable to a host of other infectious diseases, a study has concluded.The common childhood removal of the tonsils or adenoids in the throat also increased the chances of allergic conditions and skin and eye diseases as well, Australian researchers found.This is likely to be because the\u0026nbsptissues play an important role in the early immune system, detecting and blocking the invasion of bacteria and viruses into the lungs and throat.They are often removed if they’re obstructing easy breathing, or where they are causing repeated bouts of tonsillitis and middle-ear infections.But the authors of this latest study say alternatives to surgery should be considered because of the increased risk of all types of infection.“Risks were significant for many diseases and large for some,” after surgery, the authors write in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Otolaryngoloygy.The study used health records from 1.2 million Danish children between 1979 and 1999, of which 60,400 had a tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, or combined surgery.It looked at these same children in their 30s and found patients who had a childhood tonsillectomy tripled their risks of infections of the upper airways like colds, rhinitis and bronchitis, compared to people who kept their tonsils.The risk of asthma and pneumonia were also increased by roughly 50 per cent in people who had the surgery.Because these infections are already common in the community, the extra impact of having your tonsils out could be considerable, the authors said.Our results show increased risks for long-term diseases after surgery, support delaying tonsil and adenoid removal if possible, which could aid normal immune system development in childhood and reduce these possible later-life disease risks,” said the study\u0027s lead author, Dr Shaun Bayers from the University of Melbourne.As we uncover more about the function of immune tissues and the lifelong consequences of their removal, especially during sensitive ages when the body is developing.”Removal of the adenoids, the tissue at the back of the roof of your mouth under the nasal cavity, doubled the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which includes emphysema and asthma.However these conditions are much rarer than respiratory tract infections overall – 0.25 per cent of the general population in their 30s have some form of COPD – so the impact is less pronounced.The authors said it was perhaps “not surprising” that removing these key parts of the body\u0027s immune system might undermine detection and susceptibility to respiratory infections.But they also found heightened susceptibility to 28 different types of disease, including parasitic infections, skin diseases and eye complaints – \u0026nbsp78 per cent of these were experienced more commonly in people who had these surgeries.These are unrelated to the airways and suggest there is some knock-on impact on the immune system from the loss of your tonsils or from the repeated minor infections this brings – this may become even more pronounced as the population ages.Our results show increased risks for long-term diseases after surgery, support delaying tonsil and adenoid removal if possible, which could aid normal immune system development in childhood and reduce these possible later-life disease risks,” said lead author\u0026nbspDr Shaun Bayers, from the University of Melbourne.As we uncover more about the function of immune tissues and the lifelong consequences of their removal, especially during sensitive ages when the body is developing.”Tim Mitchell, a consultant otolaryngologist and council member of the Royal College of Surgeons, said the findings were interesting and certainly warrant further investigation.“Before opting to remove tonsils or adenoids, surgeons will always consider and discuss all treatment options, including non-surgical treatments, with patients, and parents in the case of children, he said.There has been a significant decrease in the number of tonsillectomies and adenoidectomies performed in the last few decades.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

After further study of the field at New York’s Bellevue Hospital, she returned to Columbia as director of its new anaesthesia ision, its first female head of department.Building the unit from the ground up in partnership with her old mentor Dr Allen Whipple\u0026nbsp(who had steered her away from surgery), Dr Apgar\u0026nbspworked tireless as both a practising physician and administrator, no easy task when America’s entry into the Second World War in 1941 created significant staffing shortages.Dr Apgar\u0026nbspdeveloped her five-point score for assessing\u0026nbspnewborn health\u0026nbspin 1952. The test grades babies on scores of zero to two on five key criteria: the colour of their skin, their pulse rate, their reflex ability, their responsiveness to limb flexion and their respiratory rate. The resulting scores are totted up to give a total out of 10 indicating the health or otherwise of the infant in question.The criteria can be remembered by the acronym\u0026nbsp”Apgar”, standing for Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration.In 1959, by which point her test had been rolled out across US maternity\u0026nbsphospitals, Dr Apgar\u0026nbspleft the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center to\u0026nbspearn\u0026nbspa Master of Public Health degree from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health and served as vice president for medical affairs at the March of Dimes Foundation to advance the study of birth defects.She was an outspoken advocate for universal vaccinations\u0026nbspto prevent mother-to-child transmission of rubella during the pandemic that struck 12.5m people in the US between 1964-65 and contributed more than 60 articles to newspapers, magazines and academic journals, publishing her book Is My Baby All Right? with Joan Beck\u0026nbspin 1973.Dr Apgar\u0026nbspwas known throughout her career for her warm bedside manner and forthright optimism. In her personal life, she played the violin, enjoyed a range of hobbies from fly-fishing and stamp collecting\u0026nbspand took flying lessons, dreaming of swooping under the George Washington Bridge.Although\u0026nbspshe rarely campaigned against or spoke publicly about gender inequalities, Dr Virginia Apgar\u0026nbspglided past\u0026nbspthe sexism of her period with ease, preferring instead to lead by example and allow her professional excellence and commitment to her work speak for itself.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

New research suggests a vital link between our ability to sense our physical bodies and knowing how we feelStephen has been married twice. Two wedding days. Two “I do”s. Yet Stephen has no happy memories from either – or, in fact, from the marriages or any of his relationships.\u0026nbspHe met his first wife on a pre-nursing course when he was just 16. Six years later, they were married. Three years after that, they got orced she was never really the right one for him, he says.Almost two decades on, in 2009, he met his second wife through a dating site. He threw himself into the relationship and, the following year, with his father and her two adult siblings present, they married at the registrar’s office in Sheffield, where they both live.\u0026nbspHe put on smiles for the wedding photos because he recognised that they were expected but, as he explains: “From an inner feeling point of view, anything I do that requires an emotional response feels like a fake.“Most of my responses are learned responses. In an environment where everyone is being jolly and happy, it feels like I’m lying. Acting. Which I am. So it is a lie.”\u0026nbspHappiness isn’t the only emotion that Stephen struggles with. Excitement, shame, disgust, anticipation, even love… he doesn’t feel these, either. “I feel something but I’m unable to distinguish in any real way what that feeling is.” The only emotions he is familiar with are fear and anger.\u0026nbspSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autism, which Stephen does not have, or with psychopathy, which he doesn’t have, either.Last year, at the age of 51, he finally learned what he does have: a little-known condition called alexithymia, a word made from Greek parts meaning, roughly, “no words for emotion”.Despite the name, the real problem for people with alexithymia isn’t so much that they have no words for their emotions, but that they lack the emotions themselves. Still, not everyone with the condition has the same experiences. Some have gaps and distortions in the typical emotional repertoire.Some realise they’re feeling an emotion, but don’t know which, while others confuse signs of certain emotions for something else – perhaps interpreting butterflies in the stomach as hunger pangs.\u0026nbspSurprisingly, given how generally unrecognised it is, studies show that about one in 10 people fall on the alexithymia spectrum. New research is now revealing what’s going wrong – and this work holds the promise not only of novel treatments for disorders of emotion, but of revealing just how the rest of us feel anything at all.\u0026nbspAfter working as a nurse for 10 years, Stephen decided he wanted to do something different. A two-year Access to University course led to a degree in astronomy and physics, and then to a job testing computer games.He built a successful career for himself, working for various companies in their computer testing departments, managing teams, and travelling around the world to speak at conferences. He had no problem conveying facts to colleagues.It was in the context of more personal relationships – or any other scenario that would typically involve expressions of emotion – that he felt things were “wrong”.\u0026nbsp“At the beginning of a relationship, I’m totally into who that person is,” he explains. “I’ve been told I’m very good at maintaining a honeymoon period for ‘longer than expected’. But after a year it takes a massive turn. It all falls apart. I’ve put myself on a pedestal to be this person which I’m really not. I react mostly cognitively, rather than it being emotions making me react. Obviously, that is not valid. It’s not real. It seems fake. Because it is fake. And you can only pretend for so long.”\u0026nbspHe and his current wife stopped living together in 2012. He saw a GP and was prescribed antidepressants. Though he was still in contact with his wife, it was clear that the relationship was no longer working. In June 2015, he attempted suicide.“I had actually been posting on Facebook and Twitter regarding killing myself and someone – I’ve never found out who – contacted the police. I was taken to hospital and treated.”\u0026nbspA psychiatrist referred Stephen for a series of counselling sessions and then a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy, a type of Freudian-based therapy that, in trying to uncover unconscious drivers of thoughts and behaviour, is similar to psychoanalysis.\u0026nbspIt was in a book called Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt, which his therapist recommended, that he first came across the concept of alexithymia.“I brought it up in therapy, and that’s when we started talking about how I was very alexithymic. Obviously, I’ve got a vocabulary. I’ve got words for emotions. But whether they’re the right words for the right emotion is a different point altogether… I just thought that I wasn’t good at talking about how I feel and emotions and stuff like that. But after a year of therapy, it became apparent that when I talk about emotions I don’t actually know what I’m talking about.”The term “alexithymic” dates from a book published in 1972 and has its origins in Freudian psychodynamic literature.Freudian ideas are now out of favour with most academic psychologists, as Geoff Bird, a professor of psychology at the University of Oxford explains. “Not to disrespect those traditions, but in the cognitive, neuro, experimental field, not so many people are really very interested in anything associated with Freud any more.”But when Bird read about alexithymia, he found the descriptions intriguing. “Actually, it’s really quite amazing.” For most people, “at a low level of emotion, you might be a bit unsure about exactly what you’re feeling, but if you have a strong emotion, you know what it is”. And yet somehow, here were people who simply did not know.\u0026nbspBird started his academic career studying autism spectrum disorder, empathy and emotional awareness, which led to his interest in alexithymia.In one of his first studies in this field, he linked alexithymia, as measured with a 20-item checklist developed at the University of Toronto, with a lack of empathy. If you can’t feel your own emotions in the typical way, it makes sense that you can’t identify with those of others, either.\u0026nbspBut what really drew Bird into alexithymia research were his interactions with people with autism. “There has been this perception that people with autism don’t have empathy. And that’s rubbish. And you can see that immediately as soon as you meet some autistic people.”In a series of studies, Bird has found that about half of people with autism have alexithymia – it’s these people who struggle with emotion and empathy, while the rest do not. In other words, emotion-related difficulties are intrinsic to the alexithymia, not to the autism.Bird is passionate about spreading this message. He talks with feeling about one particular autistic study volunteer who did not have alexithymia: “A lovely guy with an IQ we couldn’t measure, it’s that good. He couldn’t hold down a job. But he volunteered to work at a care home because he wanted to do something productive with his time.“They said, ‘Oh because you’ve got a diagnosis of autism you can’t do empathy, therefore you can’t look after our elderly people.’ Which is just ridiculous.”\u0026nbspBird has since run a series of studies exploring alexithymia outside the context of autism. He has found, for example, that people with the condition have no trouble recognising faces, or distinguishing pictures of people smiling and frowning.“But for a few of our really alexithymic people, while they can tell a smile and a frown apart, they have no idea what they are. That is really quite strange.”\u0026nbspMany of the people with the condition who Bird has met talk about being told by other people that they’re different, though some do recognise it in themselves early on.“I guess it’s a bit like not being able to see colour, and everybody’s always banging on about how red this is or how blue, and you come to realise there’s an aspect of human experience that you’re just not participating in.”As well as better characterising alexithymia, Bird and his colleagues have also dug into what explains it, taking what could seem to be a circular argument – Stephen has problems with emotion because he has alexithymia, which is characterised by problems with emotion – and blowing it right apart.In situations that Stephen recognises as being in theory highly emotional – like telling someone “I love you” – he experiences changes inside his body. “I feel my heart race and this rush of adrenaline, but to me that feeling is always scary. I don’t know how to react. It makes me want to either run away or react verbally aggressively.”\u0026nbspFear and anger – and confusion – he understands. “Everything else just feels all the same… it’s this feeling of, ‘Errrr, I’m not quite comfortable with this – it’s not quite right’.”\u0026nbsp“Similarly with anxiety, it might be that someone experiences an emotional response associated with a fast heartbeat – which might be excitement – but they don’t know how to interpret that, and they could panic about what’s happening in their body.”\u0026nbspThe ability to detect changes inside the body – everything from a racing heart to a ersion of blood flow, from a full bladder to a distension of the lungs – is known as interoception. It’s your perception of your own internal state.\u0026nbspDifferent emotions are associated with different physical changes. In anger, for example, the heart rate rises, blood rushes to the face, and fists clench. In fear, the heart rate also rises but blood drains from the face.It’s generally thought that these changes are not entirely specific to inidual emotions, and so context is also important: if you feel your heart racing and you’re looking at a spider, you know it’s fear that you’re feeling, not sexual arousal.\u0026nbspWhat Bird, Brewer and others have found in people with alexithymia is a reduced ability, sometimes a complete inability, to produce, detect or interpret these internal bodily changes. People with the condition have normal-range IQs.They can understand as well as anyone else that they’re seeing a spider, rather than an attractive potential partner. But either their brains aren’t triggering the physical changes that it seems are needed for the experience of an emotion, or other regions of their brains aren’t reading these signals properly.\u0026nbspIn 2016, Bird and Brewer, along with Richard Cook at City University in London, published a research paper that characterised alexithymia as a “generalised deficit of interoception”.Here, then, was an explanation for these people’s problems with emotion – but also, in effect, a manifesto stating that the perception of a range of bodily signals is important for the experience of emotion in the rest of us.\u0026nbspIt’s an idea that we already express in everyday language: in English, for an apology to mean anything, it has to be “heartfelt”. If you truly love someone, it’s with “all your heart”.When you’re really angry, your “blood boils”. Instead of saying that you’re anxious, you might talk about having “butterflies in your stomach” (thought to be caused by a ersion of blood flow away from the digestive system).While most people may not be familiar with alexithymia, there is a different disorder involving flat emotions and poor empathy that seems to fascinate us, even more than it repels us: psychopathy. Can we learn more about how we feel by understanding psychopaths?Lieke Nentjes is in her early thirties. She’s slender and softly spoken it’s hard to picture her spending countless hours in small rooms with incarcerated, unshackled psychopaths, including serially violent men who have committed murder.\u0026nbsp“Then he explained that he was at the end of his therapy and was ‘resocialising’ and no one would hire him because they were intimidated by him. He wasn’t really angry. He was frustrated.”While the nature of psychopathy is still debated, psychologists generally agree that it entails, among other things, a lack of empathy or guilt, shallow emotions, and antisocial behaviour – treating other people badly and, in some cases, engaging in criminal acts.\u0026nbspIt has certainly been suggested that the reason some psychopaths are able to torture or murder people is that they don’t process emotions properly – they don’t feel fear, for example, and they don’t recognise it in others.\u0026nbspNentjes is based at the University of Amsterdam. Here in the Netherlands, if a criminal is found to have a psychological condition that relates to the crime, he or she is deemed to be only partially responsible.Such criminals might spend a few years in a regular jail before being sent to a secure treatment centre, or they may be sent straight for treatment.\u0026nbspNentjes decided to assess a range of criminals from these centres and from jails to find out just how psychopathic they were (with particular attention to different aspects of psychopathy), to learn about their lives – their upbringing, and their criminal behaviour – and also to measure their interoceptive ability.\u0026nbsp“Emotion is very central when you look at psychopathy – or rather, lack of emotion,” she says. So could it be that psychopathic offenders just aren’t very in touch with their bodies?\u0026nbspIn the course of the interviews, Nentjes asked questions to probe their levels of empathy, and how much remorse they felt about what they had done to their victims. “Some were just completely honest, and would say, ‘I don’t care,’” she says.“Others who were psychopathic would say, ‘Oh, but I’m very empathic.’ They had learned the lingo to describe feelings very accurately and they could talk about compassionate, empathic feelings towards others – but then when you look at the crimes they have committed…” Her sentence trails off.\u0026nbsp“There is research finding that psychopathic offenders can describe emotions in terms of words, but they lack the inner experience of the emotion,” she adds.\u0026nbspSince assessing a person’s ability to detect a range of bodily signals is tricky, the most commonly used measures of interoceptive sensitivity are based on judgements of heart rate. One test involves asking participants to count their heartbeats over varying periods – 25 or 50 seconds, perhaps – multiple times.About 10 per cent of us are good at counting heartbeats, 5 to 10 per cent are very bad, and the rest fall somewhere in between.In another test, volunteers are played a series of beeps that are either in sync or out of sync with their heartbeat, and asked which it is. On this type of task, about 10 per cent of the general population can do it really well, and 80 per cent can’t do it at all.\u0026nbspNentjes brought the necessary equipment for the heartbeat synch task with her into the interview rooms, and took measures for 75 offenders. She found a clear link: the higher an offender’s score on the antisocial aspect of psychopathy, the poorer their performance on the heart-rate task.This does at least suggest that psychopaths who are poorer at detecting bodily signals feel less emotion and therefore less empathy for others.Psychopathic criminals are sometimes ided into the “white-collar” type, who tend to commit non-violent crimes such as fraud, and the violent type. In her interviews with this violent group, Nentjes was struck by one similarity, in particular, compared with the white-collar group.“That was their upbringing. Or rather lack of it. Emotional abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. A lot of physical abuse. I’ve heard people literally say that emotion is not of use to them. All they felt during their upbringing was fear.”\u0026nbspAs a child, Stephen suffered extreme emotional neglect. When he was six, his mother intentionally set fire to their home in Nottingham while she, Stephen, his younger brother and even younger sister were all inside. Fortunately, the children’s father, who had left for work, realised that he’d forgotten his packed lunch and came home.\u0026nbspLooking back, Stephen says it’s clear that his mother was suffering from post-natal depression. But she received no treatment, “and all I knew was anxiety and being worried”. After the fire, his mother went to prison. His father was a steelworker, who worked all kinds of shifts.“A neighbour contacted social services and Dad was told to sort it out or they’d take us away. None of my dad’s brothers or sisters wanted me or my brother because we were little shits. We were always in trouble. Robbing shops. All kinds of stuff. So we went into care.”\u0026nbspFor the rest of his childhood, Stephen was in and out of care homes. The only emotions he remembers feeling, even then, are fear, anger and confusion. “Christmas, birthdays, people out of the blue at care homes being nice to me… I never really got used to it. I always felt uncomfortable. There’s just a mess of feelings inside me that I don’t interpret properly, or respond to properly.”\u0026nbspAlexithymia is often associated with trauma and neglect from a young age, explains Geoff Bird. Twin studies have suggested a genetic component, too. And it’s also linked to certain types of brain damage, particularly to the insula, the region that receives interoceptive signals.\u0026nbspAs Rebecca Brewer notes, the kind of anxiety that Stephen experiences is common in people with poor interoception. At the University of Sussex, Hugo Critchley and Sarah Garfinkel, who have expertise in psychiatry and neuroscience, are looking at ways to alter interoception, to bring anxiety down.\u0026nbspGarfinkel has put forward a three-dimensional model of interoception that has been well received by others in the field. First, objective accuracy at perceiving interoceptive signals – how good you are at counting heartbeats, for example.Second, subjective report – how good you think you are. And third, metacognitive accuracy – how good you are at knowing how good you actually are.\u0026nbspThe third dimension is important because various studies have found that the gap between how good someone thinks they are at counting heartbeats, for example, and how good they actually are predicts their levels of anxiety.Lisa Quadt, a research fellow with the Sussex group, is now running a clinical trial with the aim of testing whether reducing this gap for people with autism can reduce their anxiety.In a pilot study, Critchley, Garfinkel and MSc student Abigail McLanachan recruited a group of students who came into the lab for six training sessions. In each session, they first did the heartbeat-counting task.The volunteer sat at rest, with a loose rubber pulse oximeter on their forefingers, and reported how many beats they’d counted. Then McLanachan told them how they’d done so that they got a better sense of how accurate they were.McLanachan then got them to do a few minutes of jumping jacks or walking fast up the steep hill outside the building – whatever was necessary to raise their heart rate, to make it easier to detect. (“Because some people really can’t feel their heartbeat at all. I can’t,” Quadt explains.)Then they went back into the lab, did the tasks again and, as before, were given feedback each time.\u0026nbspThis was just a pilot study on a general student population. But after three weeks, not only had the students’ accuracy improved on all three dimensions of interoception, but they also reported reductions in anxiety of around 10 per cent.\u0026nbspFor the main trial, volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will complete the same tasks as in the pilot, but once at the start and once at the end they’ll do them inside an MRI scanner.This will allow the team to monitor activity in the insula, which receives heart-rate data, and look at how changes in that activity may correspond to connections between the amygdala, which detects threats, and the prefrontal cortex, which can work out whether a potential threat really is or is not dangerous and so whether anxiety is warranted.The hope, Critchley explains, is to see improved connectivity between these two regions, which previous studies have linked to reduced anxiety.\u0026nbspIn Oxford, meanwhile, Geoff Bird wants to look at the idea that there are two different types of alexithymia. People with one type don’t produce enough of the bodily signals necessary for the experience of an emotion, so would be unlikely to benefit from the Sussex group’s kind of training.People with the other type produce all kinds of bodily sensations but their brains don’t process these signals in the typical way. This second group, which includes Stephen, might benefit more.\u0026nbspBird stresses that, although people with alexithymia struggle to understand emotion, that doesn’t mean they don’t care about other people. “For the most part, iniduals with alexithymia can recognise that others are in a negative state, and this makes them distressed.“The problem is that they can’t work out what the other person is feeling, and what they are feeling, and therefore how to make the other person feel better or how to reduce their own distress. I think that’s important because alexithymia is different from psychopathy in that respect.”Stephen says that for him, this is certainly true. And in theory, an emotional training technique is something he would welcome. “I’ve got several books about emotions and feelings and they don’t make a jot of difference because they’re not talking specifically enough about what you actually feel within your body is which emotion.”\u0026nbspFor now, given the absence of available treatments for alexithymia, Stephen plans to use his newfound understanding of himself, gained through therapy, to try to move forwards. At first, he says, he hoped that therapy would fix everything.“I thought every day would be perfect, brilliant… and I’ve come to realise that’s not going to happen. I’m always going to have problems, always going to have issues.”\u0026nbspHe’s learned valuable lessons, he says. Though he and his wife are still separated, they talk regularly and now he tries not to reject her views on his anxiety. “Rather than go, ‘No,’ I will listen. I think, ‘Well, you know what emotions are about and I don’t, so I’m going to listen to you and I’ll either take it on board or I’ll find a way to deal with it’.”He’s also thinking about moving to work with people who are struggling with substance abuse, because he’d like to be back in a career where he can help people.\u0026nbspMost of all, he’s determined to use his diagnosis of alexithymia. “For me, it empowers me – now I know about it, I can read about it. I can find out more about it. And I can develop certain tools that enable me to combat it.”People without alexithymia could probably use such tools as well. Bird has led work showing that people who are more aware of their own heartbeat are better able to recognise others’ emotions, a crucial first step in being empathetic.He’s planning studies to investigate whether heartbeat training might therefore increase empathy.\u0026nbspThose who want to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in daily life, but who either can’t or don’t want to change the sources of stress, could focus on changing the signals coming from their bodies instead.Regular physical exercise should dampen down the kinds of bodily signals (from the heart and circulation, for example) that the brain could interpret as being anxious – so it should dampen down feelings of anxiety, too.\u0026nbspKnowing that signals from our bodies underpin our emotions could be empowering for all of us.

But now here she is, a teenager, and we are watching Love Island together.I am a Love Island virgin, which are three words you won’t hear together very much over the next eight weeks. I have never seen it before, and am only vaguely aware of it. That isn’t to say I’m some television snob I’ve watched copious amounts of Big Brother. I do like I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!. I have caught myself laughing at Mrs Brown’s Boys. I even saw The Chase once.But somehow, Love Island has been slightly beyond the periphery of my experience. I mean, I’ve never seen The Only Way is Essex, but I feel like I have. Love Island, though… my reality TV filter must be clogged, and the past three\u0026nbspseries of it have been caught up in the webbing, never really permeating even my subconscious mind.I have a vague idea that Love Island is some combination of castaways having to undergo Bear Grylls-style survivalist trials crossed with the sort of orgy the Marquis de Sade might have dreamed about after eating a particularly pungent cheese too close to bedtime.So, here we are, settling in front of ITV2, my teenage daughter and I. My wife questions the wisdom of Alice encouraging me to watch a programme which, she informs me, will feature a parade of nubile young women in bikinis, as though I am a pensioner in a comedy sketch who might have a heart attack. But I am insistent Alice and her friends have been frantically Snapchatting all evening in excitement at the prospect of series four of Love Island. This will help me get down with the kids, I am sure of it.I ask Alice for a brief précis of what it’s all about as the titles start. She tells me that there will be more boys than girls and everyone has to couple up but the spare boy then has to steal a girl from\u0026nbspone of the others and at the end of the first round the boy without a girl is unceremoniously dumped from the show.How utterly awful, I think. And is there a point to it all? Apparently, yes £50,000 for the last couple standing. And, apparently, “Instagram promotions”, whatever that might entail. But wait monogamy is not the name of the game. Every so often there has to be a process of “recoupling”, says Alice, which sounds to me like something unpleasant from an episode of 1970s sci-fi series Logan’s Run.This, I ponder, is going to be an interminable couple of months. Surely they must do something other than pant over each other? Yes, Alice says. There are tasks and challenges. What, like they have to catch fish and find coconuts and stuff?She laughs. No, not like that at all. And as the first of the female contestants begins to arrive, I start to understand. This is not so much Bear Grylls as Bare Arse. The girls are deposited at a posh hotel inidually, via Jeep, dressed in the teeniest, tiniest of bikinis. There is Samira, who is a dancer, Hayley, who is a model, Kendall, who manages a shoe shop. They are wearing a handkerchief’s worth of fabric between them. By the time Danny Dyer’s daughter rocks up, I am secretly wishing someone would put some clothes on. I must be getting old.I lose track of who is who because I’ve had a sudden moment of dissonance. The voiceover guy has a Scottish accent that sounds awfully familiar. It is Iain Stirling, Alice informs me. “Don’t you remember? He used to be on CBBC.”Oh my God. He’s the fresh-faced young chap who used to come on with Hacker T Dog. I always had a fondness for Hacker because he was from Wigan, like me. And now his mate Iain is narrating this cesspit. I look at my daughter, and remember those years of Tracy Beaker and Dora the Explorer. Truly, the days of innocence are over.I ask Alice, cautiously, nervously, if she looks up to these girls, whose makeup has more mass than their clothing and who are talking about willies. She rolls her eyes. “It’s just entertainment, Dad.” I think there are five practically naked girls cavorting on screen now, but to be quite honest I’m eyeing up the fire pit on the sun terrace. Is it gas powered? Where does the canister go?But here comes Caroline Flack, presiding over things like some brothel keeper in a Wild West frontier town. Because that’s exactly what it feels like when the boys turn up, one by one, like cattlemen who have been on the trail too long, excitedly wringing their stetsons and being invited by Flack to inspect the lineup of girl flesh on offer and take their pick.Oh, the girls do have a tiny bit of agency they are allowed to take a step forward if the boy in front of them takes their fancy. But ultimately, the guy gets to choose, though I am told these roles reverse in the coming days.The boys are all rippling six packs and tattoos. There’s one called Niall, who seems sweetly funny, and a guy called Wes, who claims to be some kind of engineer in the nuclear industry, except he’s having trouble saying the word “nuclear”. He gives up and falls back on some double entendre, which I’m 100 per cent sure some researcher has not written for him, promising with a leery wink to “engineer the ride of someone’s life” and then, if that was a bit too subtle, says something about having a big gear stick.My wife, no doubt thinking ahead to getting up at 6.30am today, wonders just how these people get eight weeks off work to do this. And that’s never more pressing a question than when Alex turns up. He’s an A\u0026ampE doctor. How can they spare him? He’s presumably done six years of medical school so he can try to crack off with a girl on a televised Club 18-30 holiday. Doesn’t he know how hard-pressed the NHS is? Hasn’t he seen 24 Hours in A\u0026ampE?Half an hour in and I try to get into the spirit of things by betting my daughter a fiver (I know, I know, the sheer crimes of moral turpitude we have descended to) that a boy whose name sounds like\u0026nbspEeyore, but is Eyal, will pick Samira, the dancer, who seems quite switched on compared to the others. I lose the wager. I’m disappointed in Eyal. I thought he had more about him.We meet Jack, who has the most astonishingly white teeth I have ever seen in my life. Apparently he went all the way to Turkey to get them done. You could see the glow of his teeth from the International Space Station.\u0026nbspI have drifted off when someone says, in what context I know not, that it’s “too soon to spoon!” Is it too soon to switch over and watch Lucy Worsley cosplaying a suffragette, I wonder?By this point I am finding it all quite dreadful, and not because I’m old. It’s because it reminds me of what it was like to be young. If you were ever left standing tearfully at the end of musical chairs, if you ever were picked last for games, if you ever walked home alone from a disco and listened to “How Soon Is Now?” by The Smiths on repeat while staring mournfully at your Betty Blue poster, if despite your best efforts you could only ever cultivate the physique of Little Plum from The Beano, then Love Island is a hateful parade of everything you wanted to be but weren’t.I look at Alice. God, I think, please don’t ever be so shallow as these people. But she’s on Snapchat with her friends. One of them likes Jack, he of the luminous gnashers. Alice pulls a face. Who do you like best, I ask? Eyal.Back on screen, Eyal is indeed coming across as, relatively, deep. He is trying to explain to Hayley, the model, what the word “superficial” means. There’s a new guy arrived, called Adam, whose job is to break up one of the couples and get his chosen girl to be with him. It’s becoming like a standard night out, except there are no fights. Apparently giving someone who tries to steal your girl a good shoeing is verboten and gets you kicked out.A little too late, perhaps, I start to wonder if this is really appropriate for Alice. But she has already seen the latest season of 13 Reasons Why, and also informs us that she has watched a movie called Ibiza that is trailed in the ad break which seems to be very heavy on jokes revolving around male ejaculation. Where did those Dora the Explorer days go? When Adam is going round trying to steal girls I want to shout at the screen, “Swiper no swiping!” But it would just make me sad.Everyone goes to sleep, the “couples” sharing beds. They are young and full of self-esteem, and no one is in their forties\u0026nbspand worried about snoring or accidental nocturnal flatulence. As far as I can tell, nobody has sex, which is a relief. It’s probably the best night’s kip Alex the A\u0026ampE doctor has had for years.Are you embarrassed watching this with me, I ask.\u0026nbspAlice shrugs. “Not on the first episode,” she says. “I probably would be, later on.” It will, I am told, get heavy later on. I am slightly aghast. People will actually have sex? On the telly?There was one couple that didn’t last year, says Alice. One couple that didn’t do it? Only one? I’m not sure whether to feel proud of them or sorry for them.It feels like this is going to be a very long eight weeks, daily doses of people pretty much doing the same thing over and over again. A bit like Dora the Explorer. And even with the salacious promise of off-screen sex among these beautiful, vacuous people, I imagine it’s going to be less the Marquis de Sade’s 120 Days of Sodom than 56 Days of Sod All.It’s too much time to devote to these people, and I’m afraid Alice might be on her own – with her pals on Snapchat of course – for the rest of Love Island. I gave it a go and it at best bored me, at worst made me feel vaguely angry and depressed.Though I might tune in tonight, just to see who gets kicked out after last night’s cliffhanger…or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

While the discovery does not shed light on whether Mars was once home to alien life,\u0026nbspand whether it could still be,\u0026nbspthe findings could be the result of ancient life there.“The chances of being able to find signs of ancient life with future missions, if life ever was present, just went up,” said Curiosity’s project scientist, Ashwin Vasavada of Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\u0026nbspExperts say that the findings should propel us to look for conclusive evidence of alien life living on the planet.“With these new findings, Mars is telling us to stay the course and keep searching for evidence of life,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at Nasa\u0026nbspheadquarters\u0026nbspin Washington. “I’m confident that our ongoing and planned missions will unlock even more breathtaking discoveries on the Red Planet.”The new announcement is actually the result of two\u0026nbspnew studies that reveal vast\u0026nbspdetail about how methane exists on the planet, as well as the unexpected organic molecules that are preserved in its soil.And one team has made a significant breakthrough in our attempt to understand the ancient organic matter on Mars, which could help us discover\u0026nbspwhether the world was once habitable and what happened to it in the billions of years since.The surface of Mars is inhospitable today. But in the past, it almost certainly had liquid water, which could have helped fuel life there.The Curiosity rover has headed to an area that was thought to once have been a large lake of that water, inside Gale Crater. It was inside that hole where scientists found the new findings, which suggest the\u0026nbspwater lake had all the necessary ingredients for life – from chemical building blocks\u0026nbspto the energy sources required to sustain life.\u0026nbspThe two studies appear in the journal Science. In a companion article, an outside expert describes the findings as “breakthroughs in astrobiology”.\u0026nbsp“The question of whether life might have originated or existed on Mars is a lot more opportune now that we know that organic molecules were present on its surface at the time,” wrote Utrecht University astrobiologist Inge Loes ten Kate of the Netherlands.\u0026nbspKirsten Siebach, a Rice University geologist who was also not involved in the studies, is equally excited. She said the discoveries break down some of the strongest arguments put forward by life-on-Mars sceptics, herself included.\u0026nbsp“The big takeaway is that we can find evidence. We can find organic matter preserved in mudstones that are more than 3 billion years old,” Ms Siebach said. “And we see releases of gas today that could be related to life in the subsurface, or at the very least are probably related to warm water or environments where Earth life would be happy living.”\u0026nbspThe methane observations provide “one of the most compelling” cases for present-day life, she said.\u0026nbspScientists have long been baffled by the discovery of significant amounts of methane on Mars. On Earth, most methane is produced by biological sources, leading to hopes\u0026nbspthe Red Planet is more alive than we had thought.The new data suggests\u0026nbspthe methane is being stored underneath the surface of the planet. Seasonal changes appear to bring that methane out and onto the surface, where it has been detected by Curiosity,\u0026nbspsuggest the scientists.Another piece of research published simultaneously shows that intriguing organic molecules have been found in ancient rock on Mars. Curiosity took new samples and heated them so that it could analyse the molecules that were released – and the data showed there is certain matter\u0026nbspsimilar to the kind of organic-rich rock found on Earth.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Also, they are organised in repeated groups, as expected if the animal had multiple paired appendages.”Previously, no evidence of limbed animals had been discovered that pre-dated the Cambrian Explosion, the sudden surge in ersity that occurred on Earth around 510 to 540 million years ago.Unusually, the footprints of the creature in question appear to be irregular and disorganised, suggesting it was somewhat clumsy.In the paper published on the findings, researchers said tracks bore a resemblance to fossil prints recorded\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspDunure and Montrose in Scotland, thought to be between\u0026nbsp419 and 358 million years old.The new find does not however provide scientists with enough information to determine what kind of animal the footprints\u0026nbspbelonged to.“We explicitly stated in the paper that we do not know exactly what animals made these footprints, other than that the animals must have been bilaterally symmetric because they had paired appendages,” Dr Xiao added.“At least three living groups of animals have paired appendages – arthropods such as bumble bees, annelids such as bristle worms, and tetrapods such as humans.\u0026nbsp“Arthropods and annelids, or their ancestors, are possibilities and modern arthropods and annelids provide appropriate analogue to guide our interpretation of these fossils.\u0026nbsp“But unless the animal died and preserved next to its footprints, it is hard to say with confidence who made the footprints.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It really broadens the scope of possibilities.The fossils also provide insights into the evolution of tetrapods from fish during this period.Dr Gess said that the Devonian tetrapods ultimately pioneered the way for our ancestors up out of a dangerous, swampy world into the sunshine and a bright new future.The discovery was made at Waterloo Farm near Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape after the South African National Roads Agency carried out controlled rock-cutting explosions along the N2 highway.This cutting exposed dark grey mudstones of the Witpoort Formation that represent an ancient environment of a brackish, tidal river estuary that contains abundant fossils of animals and plants.The research was supported by the South African DST-NRF Centre of Excellence in Palaeosciences, based at the University of the Witwatersrand and the Millennium Trust.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We now know that every form of Brexit will damage our country and threaten jobs and livelihoods, and even the prime minister is now admitting we are heading for a terrible deal.”Meanwhile, one of Boris Johnson’s ministers provoked fresh controversy when he suggested a second EU referendum on the final Brexit deal would be “possible”.Sir Alan Duncan told an audience in Berlin that voters would not be allowed to reverse the original decision to leave the EU but they would get “the choice would be between the exit deal on offer or having no deal at all”.It comes as MPs gear up for weeks of parliamentary warfare over preparations for leaving the EU, as it was announced that two key Brexit bills will return to the Commons.Cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom revealed that the long-delayed trade and customs bills will both be debated by MPs in mid-July, following speculation the government has kicked the vital legislation into the long grass over fears of conflict with pro-EU rebels.Her announcement came ahead of next week’s Commons showdown over Ms May’s flagship Brexit legislation – the EU (Withdrawal) Bill – where ministers will seek to overturn all 15 Lords defeats during a fraught two-day contest.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Hippos are susceptible to the infection, and can pass it to humans who eat infected meat.\u0026nbspZambia\u0026nbspinitially suspended a planned cull in 2016 following pressure from activists, but Born Free\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspaccused\u0026nbspthe government of “secretly” overturning the decision and “promoting the cull to trophy hunters”.\u0026nbspWill Travers, chief executive of\u0026nbspthe charity, told The Independent\u0026nbspthe authorities have failed to provide enough\u0026nbspevidence showing\u0026nbspan overpopulation of hippos in the Luangwa River, or to make public any data that\u0026nbspjustifies\u0026nbspthe cull.They are, apparently, using the same flawed rationale for the slaughter as last time – a preventative measure to avoid a future outbreak of anthrax, combined with an assertion that low rainfall will exacerbate the situation, he said.They also appear not to have informed key stakeholders in the Luangwa Valley...\u0026nbspThe negative consequences for thousands of hippo and Zambia’s reputation as a wildlife tourism destination cannot be underestimated.”Umlilo Safaris, a South African trophy hunting company, last month began\u0026nbspoffering customers\u0026nbspa five-day “hippo management hunt” in the Laungwa Valley for £10,500 each.\u0026nbspThe organisation’s Facebook page says hunters can shoot five hippos per trip and keep the animals\u0027 tusks.Richard Kock, professor of wildlife health\u0026nbspat the Royal Veterinary College, told The Independent the government needed to provide\u0026nbspdata to justify the cull.\u0026nbsp“There’s no doubt that hippos can build up numbers until there really are probably too many for the ecosystem,” he said. “And so I think the anthrax may well be a factor in controlling their populations, and it may benefit the environment because they will consume large quantities of herbage, and obviously that will affect other species.\u0026nbsp“I’m also very sensitive to the fact people use these things as excuses for nefarious behaviour. So I would say you need good data and you need good evidence and it should be the scientific authorities who should back up any sort of criteria on culling. And it should be justified.”In a statement, Zambia\u0027s ministry of tourism said the culling was to maintain a suitable habitat for aquatic species and wildlife in general, noting that similar culls had taken place before.The hippos are causing considerable damage to the riverbanks and continue to threaten the sustainability of the river system, a spokesperson said.The move comes months after more than 100 hippos died from a suspected anthrax outbreak in Namibia.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

That debate will take place on Monday, a Storting spokeswoman told The Independent.Following that, it must receive royal assent from King Harald V before it officially becomes law.During the debate politicians said they believed it was important that students and teachers be allowed to see each others’ faces and communicate openly.The Labour Party’s Jan Bøhler said: “It is crucial for a good learning environment that one can see each other’s face throughout the open school landscape.”Mathilde Tybring-Gjedde. of the Conservative Party, added: “Tolerance for differences is essential, but at the same time, we must ensure that all people have equal participation and equal opportunities.“Kindergartens should be good learning places and meeting places. It is crucial for the children that they can have open and good communication with safe adults.”The niqab covers a woman’s whole face apart from her eyes while the burqa adds a transparent veil over the eyes. The ban would not affect the hijab, Reuters\u0026nbspreported when the bill was proposed.Åshild Bruun-Gundersen, of the conservative Progress Party which is part of Norway’s ruling coalition, called the burqa and niqab “suppressive garments that prevent integration” that prevent women “from living a free life”.Her party, which favours tighter rules on immigration, wants a full ban on the coverings in public places, she said.The Socialist Left Party (SV), however, said it would not support a nationwide ban because evidence suggested that people wearing the coverings in schools was a “minimal problem”.Educational institutions, in their responses to a consultation, indicated it was “hardly a problem”, SV’s Mona Fagerås said, adding that local disputes have been settled through dialogue.Norway’s National Union of Students also believed the proposal was “not in line with the principle of equal right to education”, she said.Ms Fagerås added: “Work on women’s oppression and increased gender equality need to be strengthened. To introduce a national ban on face-covering garments does not solve the problem of women in Norway today being exposed to negative social control and honour-related violence.”The move towards instituting a ban comes nearly two years after Norway first set out its intention to restrict their usage.Last week,\u0026nbspneighbouring Denmark became the latest European country to introduce a ban on face coverings including Islamic veils.The government there claimed its new law, which does not ban headscarves, turbans or the traditional Jewish skullcap, was not aimed at any religion.Amnesty International criticised the ban, saying “all women should be free to dress as they please and to wear clothing that expresses their identity or beliefs”.“Whilst some specific restrictions on the wearing of full-face veils for the purposes of public safety may be legitimate, this blanket ban is neither necessary nor proportionate and violates the rights to freedom of expression and religion,” said\u0026nbspits Europe director, Gauri van Gulik.Police must use “common sense” in enforcing the law, Denmark’s justice minister said. It allows people to cover their faces if there is a “recognisable purpose” to doing so, like wearing a motorcycle helmet or in cold weather.France, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Netherlands and the German region of Bavaria have all implemented restrictions on wearing full face coverings in public.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I find it particularly interesting that the Israeli tweet uses a meme with women to react to the Ayatollah\u0026nbspKhamenei’s tweet.”Israel’s Mean Girls gif had been retweeted more than 9,000 times and liked more than 27,000 times within a day of being posted.The Twitter exchange came amid growing tensions in the Middle East since Donald Trump announced the US was withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal and reimposing sanctions on Iran.\u0026nbspOn Tuesday, Benjamin\u0026nbspNetanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, sought to convince European states to abandon the deal, claiming Tehran’s threats to increase uranium enrichment capacity showed it still planned to destroy Israel.Britain, France and Germany are scrambling to\u0026nbspsave the accord, under which Iran\u0026nbsppromised to curb its nuclear programme in return for lifted sanctions.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

If he fires at us, we will destroy his forces\u0027​Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to carry out direct military strikes targeting President Bashar al-Assad’s regime unless all Iranian forces are withdrawn from Syria.\u0026nbspThe aggressive ultimatum to Damascus is a significant escalation in the confrontation in Syria between Israel and Iran.The Syrian leader was “no longer immune, his regime is no longer immune. If he fires at us, we will destroy his forces,”\u0026nbspMr Netanyahu declared during a visit to London, speaking at a question and answer session at the Policy Exchange think tank.Israel has carried out a number of air strikes on Iranian bases in Syria and has repeatedly demanded that Iran, which it considers “an existential threat”, must remove its forces and weapons from Syria.But this was the first time that it had been stated that the Assad regime would be punished for the presence of Iranian forces, which have been fighting Isis\u0026nbspand Islamist rebels.Mr Netanyahu said: “I think there is a new calculus that has to take place and Syria has to understand that Israel will not tolerate the Iranian military entrenchment in Syria against Israel.“The consequences are not merely to the Iranian forces there but to the Assad regime as well, I think it’s something that he should consider very seriously.”The Israeli prime minister blamed Assad personally for the presence of Tehran’s forces in Syria as he warned of possible Israeli intervention.“Assad has to consider this: when they waged this horrific civil war, Israel did not intervene. Now the war is nearly over, he invites Iran in to entrench itself?” \u0026nbspThe Syrian leader was accused of facilitating Tehran “to move its army a thousand miles so it can threaten Israel. They want to bring in precision guided rockets with half a ton warheads and submarines to the Mediterranean… Iran does not believe in a master race, it believes in a master faith,” and is bent on conquest, Mr Netanyahu charged.The prime minister is on a tour of Western Europe to try to drum up support for further action against Iran, after US President Donald Trump reneged on an agreement between international powers and Tehran over its nuclear programme.The other signatories to the deal – Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China – as well as the United Nations have all stressed that it was working and the Iranian government was abiding by its commitment.Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and Theresa May have told Mr Netanyahu that they are\u0026nbspdetermined not to abandon the agreement, the scrapping of which could lead to nuclear proliferation in the region and beyond, they warned.That, he boasted, had been effectively destroyed by him and Mr Trump.He warned European businesses of the punitive fines they would face under American sanctions if they continued trading with Iran.Mr Netanyahu stated that his aim on the trip, instead, was to “expose” how “Iran is devouring one nation after another” and ask Western European governments to do more “about reversing Iran’s aggression in the region and getting them out of Syria”.The French, German and British leaders have all raised their concerns with Mr Netanyahu about the recent brutal violence at the Gaza border in which dozens of Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli troops.The UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, urged the Israeli government to open an independent inquiry into the deaths and injuries suffered during the protests.Asked at the London meeting why non-lethal methods, such as water cannons and rubber bullets, were not used, or even a policy of shooting at legs, rather than shoot to kill, not pursued, Mr Netanyahu insisted: “We have tried all these methods, they don’t work. These were not non-violent protests, quite the contrary.“We are doing everything we can to both minimise casualties and, at the same time, protect Israeli lives.”Referring to Israel’s success in technological innovations, Mr Netanyahu added “given our record, we probably will figure something out, but we haven’t got there yet. The last thing we want is violence or confrontation.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We don’t want to compromise,” he confessed to Vice online news. Now we all know. Our grovelling attempt to buy a friendly, friction-free and costly trade deal was doomed from the start.Brussels was never going to let Britain be better off outside.The Commission was determined to punish us for daring to leave. For believers in ever-closer union this an immutable article of faith.Abandoning the True Path is a heresy punishable by economic death.If we make it a success, we put the sacred Project in peril.In fact we should welcome Barnier’s harsh honesty.It provides an urgent wake-up call to dithering Theresa May who seems to favour a deal at any price.The PM’s weakness has made Britain a soft touch for Brussels and renegade Tories.Mrs May, a Remainer, has surrounded herself with a Downing Street coven of pro-EU fanatics and Whitehall mandarins who want her to cave in.She has a defeatist chief whip who keeps telling her she can’t win Commons votes against Brexit wreckers.And she is terrified of Chancellor Phil Hammond, a defiant Remainer who sabotaged spending on No Deal plans.Meanwhile, officials stoke fake news about a food, fuel and medicines crisis while the tax man invents a ludicrous annual £20BILLION customs bill for British exporters.Theresa May’s government is scaring itself to death.But a Sun on Sunday poll reveals voters don’t buy this rubbish.Most think, rightly, Theresa May has made a total hash of negotiations and must be replaced as PM when we leave next March.Mrs May is a rabbit in the headlights — aware of the trap she is walking into but paralysed by indecision over ways to escape.She seems to believe the EU Commission really can cripple one of the world’s major economies, wreck security ties and revive terrorism in Northern Ireland.And she is ready to cough up a gigantic £39BILLION of taxpayers’ cash for the privilege of surrendering — a prospect which enrages Remainers as much as Brexiteers.Paying that monstrous ransom in return for national humiliation would condemn the Tories to the scrapheap at the next election and hand the country over to a Corbyn-led Marxist nightmare.Ambitious Barnier — a preposterous puffed-up plutocrat — thinks he’s got it in the bag.EU needs all the friends – and money – it can get.In fact, his arrogance is causing alarm among EU leaders who want a deal — and offers Britain a chance to escape not just intact but in triumph.Barnier may have the support of France which has throughout history seen Britain as the great enemy.But many other countries — including Sweden, Holland, Italy and even Germany — regard the UK as their best customer.Trade is two-way traffic. Trade wars are bad news, as Donald Trump is starting to prove.Theresa May may be super-cautious but she has surely learned that boldness pays.She earned her leadership spurs by taking on Police Federation thugs. And she won global credit by standing up to Vladimir Putin over the Salisbury nerve agent poisonings.She must apply those lessons to this month’s crucial EU Council where member states gather to consider Britain’s future, just as Italy bursts into flames.The PM has a choice.She can accept an unpopular compromise which will unravel disastrously if British voters think they’ve been conned. Or she can march into talks with a clear, fair, take-it-or-leave-it offer to Europe from a valued economic and security ally.Her £39bn cheque is the trump card. With Greece destitute, Italy imploding and Austria, Poland and Hungary near revolt over immigration, the EU needs all the friends — and money — it can get.European leaders would have to decide whether to accept the deal or see Mrs May take everything off the table, including that mouth- watering £39bn pile of crisp Bank of England notes.Forget about “cliff edges”. The EU desperately needs that cash. There would be a stampede to stop Mrs May reaching the exit.Now it seems most if not all those casualties could have escaped if they had not been penned in their flats by fire-brigade diktat.We raise our hats to the fire service teams who risked death in this hideous blaze.

Imagine how fast Tory fortunes, shored up by Leave voters, will nose-dive if Brexit is fatally wounded.Remainers already blame them for holding the referendum. Leavers will blame them for negating 17.4million votes.There is only one solution.

He’s pointing out the reality of Brussels turning its back on the peerless UK ­security services it relies so heavily on.EU bureaucrats plainly consider a few more terrorist victims mere collateral damage in their zeal to punish us.This is the truth behind the “happy, inclusive” EU of Remainer fantasies.It is a hard-nosed trading cabal, run mafia-style by unelected bullies treating voters as cannon fodder.IT would be an act of national self-harm for MPs to reject a third Heathrow runway.Transport Secretary Chris Grayling is poised to give it the nod, possibly today.

Is it an all-weather backstop?”But Keir Starmer, Labour’s Shadow Brexit Secretary, called it “another embarrassing day for the Government”.He said Mrs May has “signed up to a flawed proposal which is inconsistent with her earlier commitments”.Earlier senior Brexiteers had been left furious at reportedly being left in the dark over the plans, after they were not shown the back-stop outline until hours before it was due to be published earlier this week.Meanwhile several leading Remain-supporting cabinet ministers were shown it at the weekend.One government figure told The Times it was a “disgrace” and a mark of the “utter shambles” of the state of Brexit negotiations in government.The document itself was causing consternation, which Eurosceptics said would put Britain “in purgatory”.With the ongoing wrangle about what type of long-term customs agreement the UK wants after Brexit seemingly set to continue, the fall-back position is becoming more likely to be required.So what is it?When the UK exits the EU, it will need a new agreement on goods travelling from Northern Ireland and the Republic.So far Britain and Brussels have failed to agree on any sort of permanent deal, so in order to break the deadlock Mrs May agreed to a fall-back option in case one cannot be found by the time we exit the bloc.Known as the “back-stop”, it would come into force after the transition period ends in December 2020 if theres no deal.It would mean the UK would keep existing trade rules, and prevent border posts being set up and trade grinding to a halt.But its original form did not have a fixed end point for the plan to finish, leading to fears it would end up being a permanent solution.This would prevent the UK from signing trade deals with other countries outside the EU, which Brexiteers say would render the vote to leave pointless.It has now been amended, saying the UK expects the future arrangement to be in place by the end of December 2021 at the latest.That would already mean delaying our effective Brexit date until more than five years after the EU referendum, and the wording leaves the potential for it to last even longer.However without a fixed end date Brexiteers were worried it would lead to a “Hotel California Brexit” where we would never really leave Brussels control.A senior Tory had warned Mrs May she could not afford to lose him.Former Brexit minister David Jones told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: We need to make sure that David Davis stays at the negotiating table.“Anything that caused him to leave would be deeply regrettable and deeply damaging to the country.The Sun had revealed last night the 69-year-old ex-SAS reservist told friends he will stay and fight the “people trying to box me in”, and today it appears he has agreed to stay on.This morning Mrs May’s former chief of staff Nick Timothy said his old boss had made a “mistake” in agreeing to a customs backstop at all.He warned a “Brexit summer crisis” now looms after she agreed to the EUs interim backstop plan in March to try and break the deadlock in the Brexit negotiations.After today’s crunch meetings things don’t get any easier for the PM, as she will fly out tonight to Canada for the G7 meetings and a showdown with Donald Trump over his steel tariffs and the looming trade war.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His friends described him as a cultured fellow and he impressed Bella with his knowledge of ballet .They next met in Paris, where they went for a date, although Bella admitted it was three months before they slept together, and that Stringfellow, was her first lover.Of course, at the time Stringfellow was seeing other women - but in 2004 their relationship became exclusive, a first for the Casanova.Bellas father Neil, a retired accountant, was initially unhappy at the match, and the couple admitted in a 2009 interview that it had taken some time for him to welcome Stringfellow into the family.In fact, Bella had been so afraid of her fathers reaction - she described her dad as old-fashioned - that she confided in her mother but put off telling him.But then one night Stringfellow had a boozy evening and slipped over, calling Bella to say hed dislocated his shoulder. The next day, she accidentally blurted out the story about her injured fella to her dad.Later that evening, the family were watching Sky News when an item came on about Stringfellow dislocating his shoulder, to which Neil turned to his daughter and said your boyfriend had better not be Peter Stringfellow, forcing her to own up.Neil went ballistic and refused to meet Stringfellow for a year. But once they met, he too fell for the businessmans charisma, with the pair becoming firm friends.Stringfellow proposed on Valentines Day 2005 and asked Neil for his daughters hand in marriage.The pair then moved in together, dividing their time between his plush, famously leopard-print decorated villa in Majorca and London.By this point, Bella had given up ballet. She cited the immense pressure to stay thin for her job as being a major reason behind her decision.Shed later be given a role as Executive Editor on the Stringfellows in-house magazine.Conservative-supporter Stringfellow would often take his wife to Tory functions, where she met Prime Minister Theresa May.Bizarrely, it was former PM Margaret Thatcher who may have planted the seed for the couple to actually go through with the wedding, asking him when he was going to make an honest woman of his lady.Their Barbados beach wedding was an intimate affair, attended by 26 guests in total.A month after their glamorous nuptials, Stringfellow told the Daily Mail that he was madly in love with Bella.I will be a good and faithful husband to her for the rest of my life. I want to make Bella happy. I will not let her down. I have met the love of my life, he said.Up until I met Bella, exclusivity had not been part of my life. But that has all changed.The old Peter Stringfellow is gone and Bella and I are looking forward to a wonderful future together.And he stayed true to his word, with no reports of him cheating on his wife surfacing in the press during their nine years of marriage.In 2013, she gave birth to daughter Rosabella, her first child and Stringfellows third after Karen, 54, from his first marriage, and Scott, 52, from his second.Son Angelo followed two years later.They happily settled into family life, having a cosy existence cooking at home together, keeping chickens and walking their dogs.Of course, with their age difference it was likely that Stringfellow would pass away first, something the couple admitted they had discussed.He was previously diagnosed with lung cancer in 2008, and credited Bella with nursing him back to health and staying by his side throughout his medical treatments.In a 2009 interview, he said If things go according to their natural course, then I will go first and Bella will still be a stunning woman. She must move on and have a life.But Bella interrupted, saying no, no, I wont, I wont have a life, absolutely not.She has not released a statement on his death at time of writing.With his vast fortune of nearly £40m, Stringfellow has ensured his children will be educated and cared for in the best way possible after hes gone, and revealed in 2016 that he would give whatever I had left to them.They’ll have a wonderful mother and two great families on standby. Whatever I have left goes to them.Bella is still going to be a beautiful young woman when I’ve gone and she is smart enough to make sure whoever she chooses will fit in with her and the children.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Instead, Brexit has made both independence and the SNP relatively less popular among those Scots who are not very enthusiastic about the EU, even if they did vote to Remain.“So far this has been a tendency to presume that the fall in SNP support in the 2017 election simply represented a rejection of the party’s plans for a second independence referendum.“Our research suggests that it was also occasioned by a dislike of its pro-EU stance among some of former SNP voters.He added: “Meanwhile, far from simply winning votes as a result of her opposition to a second independence referendum, Ruth Davidson appears to have profited from a swing among Leave voters.“That leaves Ms Davidson with an electorate whose views on Europe are in many cases strikingly different from her own.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And if there\u0027s something you don\u0027t feel happy doing then remember Halfords offers a Free Bike Check to track down problems. The 32-point inspection covers all the crucial areas and if any problems are found the experts can also fix them for you. They also offer a great range of services and repairs for added peace of mind. Wheels first    It makes sense to start with a bike\u0027s wheels when you are doing maintenance. There are a number of things you need to check here to keep things safe. Tyres are the most obvious thing of all, so let\u0027s start there. If you haven\u0027t been out on the bike recently then it\u0027s very likely that the tyres will have deflated. Bear this in mind if you\u0027re planning a trip because you\u0027ll want to test them to ensure they hold air. Inflate them , leave the bike for a few days and come back. Hopefully they will stay inflated, but if not you might have a puncture. There are a couple of ways to deal with punctures. If you\u0027re a bit short of time, or out and about, then using a tyre sealant can be a good solution. This liquid is pumped into the tyre and will seal small punctures immediately. Slime Bike Tyre Sealant is \u0026pound9.99 and not only fixes existing punctures but also prevents future holes from causing a problem.  For most punctures you may need to use a puncture repair kit. It\u0027s a bit more time-consuming to do this as you need to remove the wheel first. If the bike doesn’t have quick release wheels then use a spanner or a tool like the Bike Hut 3 Way Socket for \u0026pound5.99 (which comes in two sizes, so check what size wheel nuts your bike uses). Check out the Halfords guide to puncture repair. Once the wheel is off, using the Halfords Essentials Puncture Repair Kit , above, which is just \u0026pound12, will allow you to get the tyre off the wheel using the included levers. Some punctures might be really obvious, if not then inflate the inner tube - if you don\u0027t have a pump why not pick up the Halfords Metal Track Bike , below, for just \u0026pound20 (save \u0026pound5).  Once inflated, submerge in a bucket or bath of water and look for the bubbles. The puncture repair kit comes with chalk and a crayon to mark the area you need to fix. Once you\u0027ve found the puncture a brief rub with sandpaper before you apply the patch helps the adhesive stick properly. Large punctures will require a new inner tube. If you\u0027re planning a big family cycling trip then you\u0027ll also want to make sure you have a compact pump with you when you\u0027re out and about. Check out the Bikehut High Pressure Bike Pump for \u0026pound15 (save \u0026pound4). You should also carry spare inner tubes with you as some punctures can’t be repaired. Gears may need specialist attention    Although expert riders may feel confident adjusting their own gears it\u0027s not a job to undertake unless you know what you\u0027re doing. The big problem with messing about with gears is that you can make a simple problem worse and render your own, or your children\u0027s bike, impossible to ride. Ultimately though, it\u0027s not worth taking risks with your family\u0027s bikes and their safety. Instead, get an in-store Halfords expert to help you get your gears working again. A FREE Bike Check will locate problems and then a trained expert will be able to fix them safely for you. A regular service will help to stop these problems before they appear and will likely be cheaper than repair. Also take a look at the Halfords Adult Bike Care Plan and the Kids Plan to keep your bikes in tip-top condition. Brakes are crucial    It\u0027s obvious but important to mention that without brakes you\u0027re in big trouble. Every bike needs regular checks on its braking system, as you ride it\u0027s inevitable that cables stretch slightly and brake pads can wear down. This needs to be corrected, and because brakes are crucial you might want to consider popping in to Halfords to have them serviced. You can certainly tell if you have a problem first though. Test the front and back brakes on your own and your kid\u0027s bikes regularly to make sure they stop the wheels. You can inspect the brake pads to make sure they’re aligned with the rims, if not they need to be serviced. A FREE Bike Check at Halfords will locate any problems and the in-store experts can get your brakes working perfectly again. Halfords has Bike Care Plans which cost \u0026pound15 for a year children\u0027s bikes and \u0026pound25 for adults . These plans include a silver service which checks everything from wear and damage to aligning the brakes. Never break the chain    Don\u0027t worry, it\u0027s very unlikely that you\u0027ll suffer a broken chain , but it can happen. If it does you\u0027ll be stuck, so it\u0027s really worth having a repair kit with you, especially if you\u0027re mountain biking. Check out the Park Tool Chain Brute Tool for just \u0026pound9.98, ideal if you need to repair a broken chain on the road. You might also need to carry some spare chain links with you too - you\u0027ll need to make sure they are compatible with your bike. It\u0027s also worth keeping your family\u0027s bike chains well oiled, or as most people say in cycling circles lubricated. You can use oil, and this is the cheapest option at just \u0026pound4 for Cycle Oil, below . You should also clean your chain before applying lubricant, there are special cleaners to help with this.  More expensive lubricants come in either wet or dry formulas. Wet is more weather resistant but dry is more likely to be washed away by rain but doesn\u0027t gunk up your chain. Dry lubes aren’t well-suited to, say, commuting where the weather is unpredictable. Most people will want wet lubricants like Muc-Off , now \u0026pound2.99 (save \u0026pound1 off RRP). Ceramic lubricants are something of a mid-way between wet and dry offering the advantages of both, check the Muc-Off Ceramic Lube \u0026pound7.49 (save \u0026pound2.50 off RRP). Sometimes chains will come off when cycling. In some cases because they have stretched and may need shortening or replacing. In most cases they can be relocated by hand although you may want to wear protective gloves for this. Tighten everything The last step for bike maintenance should be to check the bolts, like those on the wheels, are well tightened. There\u0027s no need to over-tighten, as this can cause problems too, but make sure nuts are all firmly secured. A spanner set or special bike tool will be needed, but the Halfords 9 Piece Combination Spanner Set is just \u0026pound20 and should cover most bike nut sizes.

Experts warn Three Lions supporters heading to Russia for the showpiece could be targeted by local thugs. They are particularly fearful for gay and ethnic minority fans at the tournament, which kicks off on Thursday. In a report, the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee warns the expected 10,000 supporters expected to travel from Britain: “Russia presents particular risks as a World Cup host, due to the history of violence by football hooligans intolerance and discriminatory state policy towards LGBT individuals the history of racist abuse in and around football matches current heightened political tensions and the threat of terrorist attacks.  “We remain concerned about the safety of UK fans travelling to Russia, and the apparent lack of specific provisions to protect targeted groups, particularly LGBT football fans.” Russian hooligans have a history of targeting minorities - and MPs believe yobs will use the World Cup to commit violence. “The far-right culture of Russian hooligan groups could place LGBT fans at particular risk of violence during the World Cup,” says the 28-page report. “As with LGBT football fans, the far-right culture of Russian hooligan groups could place BAME fans at a greater risk.” MPs were especially worried about fans visiting places outside the three cities where England play group matches: Volgograd, Nizhny Novgorod and Kaliningrad.  The report highlights the “additional consular support and rigorous security measures in place on match days in cities where England plays”. But it adds: “We are particularly concerned about the safety of UK fans outside these times and places and call on the FCO to do more to make fans aware of the distinction between arrangements in place on match and non-match ays and in England and non-England match cities.”  British officials based in Moscow who were drawing up plans for keeping fans safe during the football spectacle were among those kicked out by the Kremlin in tit-for-tat expulsions following the nerve agent poisoning of former KGB agent Sergei Skripal and is daughter Yulia in Salisbury in March.

The embattled Prime Minister has made a humiliating climbdown to appease her Brexit Secretary - after a string of meetings and threats to quit. She\u0027s agreed to limit her backup plan for post-Brexit customs to one year - er, sort of - in what we in Westminster call a \u0027fudge\u0027. She was up against the clock to get it. This evening she\u0027s flying to meet Donald Trump at the G7 summit. So it\u0027s been a day of chaos in Westminster with journalists being told opposite things within minutes of each other - or even at the same time. We\u0027re here to guide you through the barmy \u0027backstop\u0027 row, how it broke out, and how it ended. Here\u0027s your minute-by-minute explanation of the last 24 or so hours. The EU has a customs union. This means all 28 member states can trade with each other without any checks or duties on goods. Theresa May has said Britain will leave this after December 2020, so she can sign trade deals with non-EU countries. But officials have warned a new UK customs system won\u0027t be ready in time. So they\u0027ve devised a \u0027backstop\u0027 - a backup plan that will carry on some EU customs rules in the UK if there\u0027s no deal. It is designed to stop ports grinding to a halt and Northern Ireland setting up border posts, which could lead to violence. Yet Brexiteers were furious because it had no set end date. In a huge Tory row, they warned it would trap Britain half-in, half-out the EU. After frantic last-minute talks, and threats to quit by Brexit Secretary David Davis, a time limit was put in - December 2021. Yet the government only expects to follow that time limit. It is not legally binding. And the EU poured cold water on it. Britain and the EU also disagree about what the backstop will do. EU plans back in March would have kept Northern Ireland aligned with Brussels customs rules, but Theresa May rejected this because it draws a border between the province and the mainland. So she drew up Britain\u0027s own backstop, which is now being put to the EU for discussion. The UK plan is a temporary customs arrangement allowing totally tariff-free trade between the EU and the whole of the UK. So the UK would carry on being in the EU Customs Union in all but name until December 2021. But the UK also wants to sign new trade deals with nations outside the EU. Britain even wants to implement parts of these deals that don\u0027t relate to the backstop. Brussels has repeatedly said this won\u0027t be possible - so the new plan is setting up for a big battle with the EU. And as time ticks on, the backstop will become less of a Plan B and more of a Plan A. It\u0027ll turn from backstop... to frontstop. Shock reports emerge that Theresa May has handed Cabinet ministers a paper on the backstop - and wants to publish it within one day. Furious Brexiteers start briefing Westminster journalists that they\u0027re being \u0027bounced\u0027 into a decision with \u0027mad\u0027 speed. They complain it has no firm time limit for when the backstop would end - leaving Britain half-in, half-out of the EU. Reports soon emerge that the chief objector is none other than the Brexit Secretary himself - David Davis. 4.25pm  At a Q\u0026ampA in Westminster, David Davis shocks journalists by leaving them in no doubt there are big splits and hinting he could resign. Asked if he can stay in his job if he doesn\u0027t approve of the backstop, Mr Davis said: “That’s a question I think for the Prime Minister, to be honest.” 10pm  Brexiteer anger deepens as it\u0027s reported Cabinet Remainers saw the document over the weekend - days before some Brexiteers, including Boris Johnson. A source tells the Times it is a disgrace and an utter shambles. Thursday 7 June 8.20am  Tory ex-Brexit minister David Jones, an ally of David Davis, takes to the airwaves to row in behind battling David Davis. He warns the backstop with no time limit would damage Britain by tying it to EU rules. But he calls on Mr Davis to keep his job, saying losing him now would be upsetting and deeply dangerous for the country. 8.44am David Davis is seen strolling through Parliament smiling, tieless and carefree on his way to a meeting with Theresa May. 10am  Theresa May holds separate, face-to-face crisis talks in her Commons office with \u0027three Brexiteers\u0027 David Davis, Boris Johnson and Liam Fox. The Brexit Secretary\u0027s meeting is the longest and goes on for more than an hour as the pair try to thrash out a compromise. He leaves the door open to the possibility he could quit. 10.27am With the ministers still in a Vatican-style conclave, Tory Brexiteer Nadine Dorries gives undoubtedly the most helpful contribution of the day. She tweets: David Davis is ex SAS He’s trained to survive. He’s also trained to take people out. #Brexit   11.25am White smoke!  A Downing Street spokeswoman tells us the talks were constructive. Asked if any of the trio of Brexiteers threatened to resign she says: No. Asked if she is confident Mr Davis will still be in his job by the end of the day she says: Yes. Government sources indicate to us that the meeting was conclusive. They say the backstop will probably be published before the meeting of the Brexit \u0027 war cabinet \u0027 at 12.30pm. 11.59am No white smoke after all!  David Davis is called BACK in to see the Prime Minister at her behest, this time in Downing Street. Talks were inconclusive, sources close to him say - the exact opposite of what journalists were told half an hour earlier. 12.16pm A source close to David Davis tells Sky News: He\u0027s not planning to resign. But then one minute later... 12.17pm An hour after the plan was supposedly agreed the threat of David Davis resigning raises its head yet again.  A \u0027senior government source\u0027, presumably close to David Davis, tells ITV: DD is not a man to be bullied. He has demanded a clearly defined time limit to the backstop and has stated he will walk if he doesn’t get it. If this is a game of chicken between the PM and DD there will only be one winner. 12.30pm The Brexit war Cabinet meeting begins and lo and behold, the paper isn\u0027t published.  1.08pm After chaotic behind-the-scenes horse trading the backstop plan is finally published. David Davis looks like he\u0027s won a victory with a date of December 2021 when the backstop should end. But it\u0027s clear his victory may prove hollow because the government only expects the date to happen - there\u0027s no guarantee. 1.47pm EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier pours cold water on the plan almost immediately.  He tweets: We will examine it with 3 questions: is it a workable solution to avoid a hard border? Does it respect the integrity of the single market and customs union? Is it an all-weather backstop? 1.47pm and 4 seconds Frantic debate ensues over what on earth an all-weather backstop is. 2.11pm  Now it\u0027s war between the Brexiteers in government and, er, the Brexiteers in government. A source tells the Times: DD claims of victory are simply delusional. Even Barnier is now expressing sympathy for him. It\u0027s beyond a joke now. 3.32pm "},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn calls theresa stand","story":"NewsJeremy Corbyn calls on Theresa May to stand up to \"bully\" Donald Trump and save British steel worker jobsThe Labour leader makes his plea as the Prime Minister goes into talks with the US President at the summit of G7 leaders in Canada\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAndrew GregoryPolitical Editor22:30, 7 JUN 2018Updated22:37, 7 JUN 2018NewsJeremy Corbyn is calling on Theresa May to show true leadership by confronting Trump over the tariffs (Image: PA)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Jeremy Corbyn today urges Theresa May to stand up for thousands of British steel workers whose jobs are being threatened by “bully” Donald Trump’s trade war.  The Labour leader makes the plea as the Prime Minister goes into showdown talks with the US President at the summit of G7 leaders in Canada.  It will be Mrs May’s first face-to-face meeting with Trump since he imposed a 25% import tax on steel imports and 10% on aluminium .  Mr Corbyn is calling on her to show true leadership by confronting the US leader over the tariffs. He says the taxes, which came into force a week ago and affect the EU, are “bad news” for British industry, putting our steel firms and tens of thousands of workers at risk.  The Labour leader writes in the Mirror: “The UK’s steel industry and its 32,000 employees are under threat from President Donald Trump’s reckless decision to jack up tariffs on steel. “Theresa May must take a lead at the summit in calling him out.” Mr Corbyn warns the tariffs are a scandal that she cannot remain silent over. He blasts the Prime Minister for lacking the “courage” so far to hold Mr Trump to account.  He also accuses the Tories of failing to act because they are “in the hope of getting a quick trade deal with the US” after Brexit .

The UK’s steel industry and its 32,000 employees are under threat from President Donald Trump’s reckless decision to jack up tariffs on steel, and Theresa May must take a lead at the summit in calling him out. The Trump tariffs are simply wrong.  They are bad news for British workers and industry. They are also bad news for US workers and industry. It is vital that all the leaders come together to condemn the Trump tariffs. We need to stop the escalation of a tit-for-tat trade war that can only be bad news for all workers and businesses. As I told the GMB trade union conference in Brighton this week, US workers are right to want a government that actively supports them and the real, everyday economy.  But the Trump tariffs don’t do that. And neither does the Trump agenda of giving handouts to the super-rich, while propping up a rigged system that hoards power and wealth for a tiny elite. Whether it’s over Trump’s Muslim ban and his shameless promotion of the far right Britain First group, his dangerous decision to abandon the Paris Climate Accord or his wilful tearing up of the Iran nuclear deal, Theresa May has repeatedly shown she doesn’t have the courage to stand up for what we all know to be right.  The Tories want to appease Trump in the hope of getting a quick trade deal with the US after we leave the European Union. But what their reaction to the Trump tariffs show is that with the timid Tories in government, we’ll end up with worst kind of race-to-the-bottom deal. That would hurt workers, consumers and our public services.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, his deputy Tom Watson, and even Tory Brexit minister Suella Braverman joined forces to back our call for recognition of Britain’s nuclear test heroes. They met Shirley Denson, 83, widow of RAF ace Eric who was subjected to radiation experiments, as well as Doug and Sandie Hern whose daughter Gilly died at the age of 13 after her dad was exposed to the fallout from five different bombs.  Corbyn told the Mirror: The UK government put these men in harm’s way by asking them to take part in nuclear tests with little to nothing by way of protection. The veterans have had to live and die with the repercussions ever since. “A medal is the first and least thing we can do to right the wrongs these veterans and families have endured, and I fully support the Mirror\u0027s campaign to give them the recognition they deserve.” It is an historic win for the Mirror’s campaign, as it is the first time any party leader has met a nuclear veteran and agreed to back them.  The MPs were joined by comedian Al Murray, better known as the Pub Landlord, who has joined the campaign. He said: “My dad and my father-in-law were both National Servicemen so they could have been in these tests. The same could be true for any one of us. “The Military Covenant demands we look after our veterans, but anyone in the forces today would look at what’s been done to these guys and see that for a lie. It’s wonderful to meet them, but absolutely horrifying to hear their stories first-hand.” Government minister Suella Braverman was among the Tory supporters. She said: “It’s really important to hear their stories of decades-long struggle and what their families have had to put up with. I think there would be a lot of support for this campaign and Parliamentary interest if we can get this heard.”  The MPs heard how Ministry of Defence documents showed Eric was exposed to 65 years’ worth of radiation in just 6 minutes while he flew through the mushroom cloud of Britain\u0027s biggest nuclear bomb in 1958. Scientists knowingly maximised his exposure, and were aware of the risk of genetic damage. Eric’s descendants have a 37% rate of birth defects and widow Shirley, 83, from Morden, south London, blames his later suicide on the effects of the radiation. Former navy cook Doug Hern, 81, and wife Sandie, 72 from Spalding, Lincs proudly showed them a photo of their daughter, and told how during two years of treatment for adrenal cancer she was photographed daily, but three hospitals now claim to have lost all records of her treatment. Studies have shown a third of the veterans were dead before 1999. Their wives report three times of the normal number of miscarriages, and their children show 10 times the usual rate of birth defects. Birmingham MP Jess Philips said: “I can’t think of any word to call it other than premeditated murder. It’s a total dereliction of duty on the part of the MoD and it shouldn’t be the responsibility of the veterans to prove the link. The link’s obvious.” Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry added: “The point is that nuclear veterans are recognised by other countries and it’s shameful that ours does not. The moment has come for them to be given justice. Stoke-on-Trent MP Ruth Smeeth said: “The veterans have had to wait much too long and we now need actions, not words.” Shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne added: “We must recognise the sacrifices they made for our country and right these wrongs. It’s time for the government to act.  Labour policy boss Jon Cruddas added: “A lot of people have felt the consequences of our nuclear tests and it’s absolutely brilliant the Mirror is making sure we don’t forget them. With 155,000 descendants of our nuclear veterans, there isn’t a constituency in the country that won’t be affected.” Tory grandee John Hayes, patron of the British Nuclear Test Veterans’ Association, said: “It’s a human tragedy that transcends party politics. Oldham MP Jim McMahon said: “When people step up to do their service for the nation it’s important that service is recognised. It’s a fantastic campaign by the Mirror.” Shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith vowed to put pressure on opposite number Gavin Williamson, who was conspicuously absent. She said: “It’s high time that our brave nuclear veterans were recognised with a medal. It’s a simple thing that the Defence Secretary can do very easily, without admitting liability. Former Treasury minister Liam Byrne said: “This is a matter of justice and duty and the government’s shameful treatment of some of our bravest veterans who put themselves right in the danger zone has got to be stopped, now.” Burnley’s Julie Cooper said: “I’ve been quite affected hearing about it. It’s such a small thing to do, the MoD can have no excuse for not giving a medal. There was also support from the House of Lords with Labour peers Baroness Alicia Kennedy and Lord Roy Kennedy, and cross-party peer Baroness Bryony Worthington signing the petition. Ealing MP Rupa Huq said: “It’s been eye-opening to learn what happened to these men. The public should hear and the government must listen.  Morden MP Siobhan McDonagh paid tribute to Mrs Denson, saying: “She has been relentless and determined and without thought for her own health. We must honour the nuclear veterans.” Maria Eagle said: “A medal seems to be the least we could do. It’s a scandal that for years the real suffering that’s resulted has not been recognised by the nation. Angela Eagle added: “It’s a really worthwhile campaign and the test veterans deserve recognition for the sacrifices they made. Brentford and Isleworth MP Ruth Cadbury said: “What’s really surprising is so many countries acknowledge responsibility and ours is the only one that doesn’t. The issues are not going away, in fact more children are being born with birth defects every day. Ilford\u0027s Mike Gapes said: “This has been a scandal for decades and the veterans have never had the recognition they deserve. We must rectify it urgently.” Tan Dhesi from Slough added: “I can’t understand why the government is the only one on Earth not to recognise the risks the nuclear veterans ran.  Chesterfield MP Toby Perkins, Sheffield’s Louise Haigh, Khalid Mahmood from Birmingham Perry Barr, Colleen Fletcher from Coventry, shadow health secretaries Paula Sherriff and Barbara Keeley, shadow veterans minister Gerald Jones, deputy speaker Rosie Winterton, Chris Elmore from Ogmore, shadow children’s minister Emma Lewell-Buck and Southampton’s Royston Smith were also joined by Tories Andrew Stephenson from Pendle, Banbury’s Victoria Prentis and Mark Menzies from Fylde. Mr Menzies said: “The least we can do is consider a medal for these veterans but in reality we need to do a hell of a lot more. Also supporting were Andy Slaughter from Hammersmith, Diana Johnson from Kingston upon Hull, shadow culture minister Kevin Brennan, Phil Wilson of Sedgefield and Yvonne Fovargue from Makerfield. Shipley MP Philip Davies pledged his support to the campaign but added: “I won’t deal with the Mirror.”  Visit petition.parliament.uk/petitions/220170 to sign the online petition.

Half of them said the abuse or harassment they received was sexist or misogynistic, with a quarter saying it threatened sexual or physical assault. Mrs May, who is representing Britain for the second time at the annual G7 summit, will say that while the California-based multinationals have made “serious efforts” to curb online jihadi threats, they must now “prioritise” tackling horrific abuse of women.  Women and girls must be able to use the web without fear of being subjected to online rape threats, harassment, cyberstalking or blackmail, the PM will add. At a G7 session specifically discussing empowering and supporting women and girls around the world, she will set out a series of bold joint actions she wants the US, Germany, France, Canada, Japan and Italy to follow. They include:  Encouraging the tech giants to use automated tools to spot and swiftly remove harmful material promoting or depicting violence against women and girls, such as rape videos or illegal violent pornography. Making internet companies remove rape threats immediately on social media platforms. Demanding web firms use innovative data analytics to identify and ban adverts or websites linked to people trafficking, where women and girls make up the majority of victims trafficked for the purposes of sexual exploitation. Considering new laws to look at how they can help deal with the perpetrators of such abuse.  Mrs May will insist tech firms must act to tackle the “unacceptable” rising abuse of women on the web. It could open up the prospect of fines and legal crackdowns. Speaking at the G7 today, the Prime Minister will say: “We know that technology plays a crucial part in advancing gender equality and empowering women and girls, but these benefits are being undermined by vile forms of online violence, abuse and harassment. “What is illegal offline is illegal online and I am calling on world leaders to take serious action to deal with this, just like we are doing in the UK with our commitment to legislate on online harms such as cyber-stalking and harassment. “Online violence against women and girls should not be separated from offline violence and the technology companies who are making welcome progress in banning and removing extremist content must use the same methods to prioritise tackling this unacceptable and deeply worrying rising trend.” "},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may humiliating climbdown brexit","story":"NewsTheresa May\u0027s humiliating climbdown to keep David Davis onboard could delay Brexit until 2021The Prime Minister bowed to mounting pressure from cabinet leavers and agreed to insert a specific date into her customs blueprint\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy political editor22:58, 7 JUN 2018Updated23:03, 7 JUN 2018NewsTheresa May’s U-turn came after a series of meetings with David Davis and other Brexiteers (Image: AFP)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheresa May was forced to accept a humiliating climbdown in a desperate bid to stop Brexit Secretary David Davis quitting. The Prime Minister bowed to mounting pressure from Cabinet Leavers and agreed to insert a specific date into her customs blueprint, outlining when “backstop” arrangements would end. The move is designed to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland if negotiators fail to come up with a better plan. But Brussels rubbished the move, with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier asking if it was “an all-weather backstop”.  Mrs May’s decision means the UK could stay signed up to EU customs union rules until December, 2021 – five-and-a-half years after Britain voted to quit the bloc. Existing arrangements are already due to last until December, 2020, through the 20-month transition period after the UK formally quits the bloc on March 29. Ministers have already agreed to fork out \u0026pound39billion for the interim deal. And No10 refused to rule out paying extra cash to Brussels to stay tied to the customs union for an extra year. May’s U-turn came after a series of face-to-face discussions with Mr Davis and his fellow leading Brexiteers, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox.  Mr Davis had an early-morning showdown lasting more than an hour with Mrs May in her parliamentary office, at which he left the door open to resigning. He was then hauled into No10 at noon for a second crunch confrontation. The key document was finally published just after 1pm, outlining the fall-back plan lasting until the end of 2021. Remain-supporting MPs branded the wording a “fudge” designed to convince Mr Davis he had won a compromise. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: “This is another embarrassing day for the Government. The clock is ticking on the process and it is imperative an agreement is struck to protect jobs and the economy, and ensure there is no hard border in Northern Ireland. “Instead, with the threat of a Cabinet resignation, Theresa May has signed up to a flawed proposal which is inconsistent with her earlier commitments.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tory government pays back thousands","story":"NewsTory government pays back thousands of severely disabled people whose benefits have been cutCharities hailed victory as ministers agreed new protections for vulnerable people on Universal Credit\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByDan BloomPolitical reporter17:42, 7 JUN 2018Updated17:48, 7 JUN 2018NewsThousands of people lost their disability \u0027premiums\u0027 by moving to UC (Image: Getty)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Tory government will pay back thousands of severely disabled people who had their benefits cut after moving to Universal Credit. Charities hailed victory today as ministers agreed new protections for some of the country\u0027s most vulnerable benefit claimants. It comes after thousands of people lost their disability \u0027premiums\u0027 by moving to UC - the Tories\u0027 flagship all-in-one benefit. Premiums recognise the extra costs people face if they don\u0027t have a carer. But they do not exist under UC, which uses a separate system. Campaigners say that left some families \u0026pound147 a month out of pocket. Now Tory minister Esther McVey has halted any more Severe Disability Premium claimants moving to UC until transition cash is in place next year. This will protect 500,000 people who currently receive SDP.  And the Work and Pensions Secretary will make up the difference - including with back payments - for those who have already lost out. Government figures suggest 4,000 people are set to benefit from back payments - the number who lost SDP by moving to UC. Another 11,000 people lost the Enhanced Disability Premium, but were not covered by the new announcement. Mencap spokeswoman Beatrice Barleon welcomed the move after warning disabled people were falling into poverty. Child Poverty Action Group chief executive Alison Garnham said: These are really welcome changes which will correct the current clear injustice.  But charities also condemned the government for only compensating the SDP group - saying help should go further and be permanent. Scope spokesman James Taylor said: These premiums are not a luxury – many disabled people rely on financial support for basic needs such as food, clothing and heating. “The loss of these crucial payments is disastrous for many disabled people. Mind spokeswoman VIcki Nash added: If the Government is really committed to supporting people with mental health problems to have control over their own lives, they must reintroduce these premiums for anyone making a claim to Universal Credit.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman loses five stone gets","story":"NewsWoman loses five stone and gets \u0027revenge body\u0027 after ex taunted her for gaining weight due to contraceptionAlexandra Quadrelli sculpted the \u0027ultimate revenge body\u0027 after being called fat by her ex, who she claims cheated on her multiple times\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByJosh Saunders21:02, 7 JUN 2018Updated22:53, 7 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A woman who was told by a previous boyfriend she was overweight lost five stone in less than four months in desperate bid to keep her new man.  Alexandra Quadrelli sculpted the \u0027ultimate revenge body\u0027 after being called fat by her ex, who she claims cheated on her multiple times. The 29-year-old from Perth, Australia, was paranoid her partner would leave her when she bulged to 15st 6oz - about 98kg - after getting the contraceptive implant. Fearing her current partner would stop finding her attractive and battling depression because she hated her appearance, she started taking 123Diet Drops and a clean eating plan. In under four months the deli assistant, originally from Milan, Italy, shed a whopping five stone - more than 31kg - from sticking to the plan without exercising. Alexandra said: Before I felt bad, frustrated, ugly, unhappy and unhealthy. I constantly had the fear of going out and having a social life because I was scared others would judge me.  My life was constantly hiding my body under large clothing, I hid myself from everyone. I always loved going to the beach but when I was a heavier weight, I was too shy to wear a swimsuit or to go shopping because I was frustrated that there weren\u0027t suitable clothes for me. I was unhealthy, unhappy and I was so scared of losing my actual boyfriend because an ex-boyfriend was so rude to me, always cheated on me and would regularly tell me how fat I was.  So I told myself no, not this time. I started to take better care of myself because my health is more important and secondly, because I wanted my boyfriend look at me in different way. Now, I love my body, feel sexy and better about myself but more important than anything else, I\u0027m healthy. I love myself more and my boyfriend sees me in a whole new way. I will always be grateful to 123Diet.  Now I have a revenge body for all the people who are discriminated against their weight I have a revenge body for my ex-boyfriend who was humiliated because of my appearance and to show myself I can do anything. Alexandra says she never struggled with weight problems in the past, until having a contraceptive implant and the stresses of moving to Australia three years ago. This led her to hit her heaviest weight when she had a BMI of 34.9.

Marine biology student Emily Stevenson, 21, and her father Rob, 50, have been cleaning beaches in Cornwall for ten years. Their community group, Beach , is made up of an army of dedicated volunteers but its task is getting tougher as the problem gets progressively worse. And after struggling to reach remote locations and remove bulky rubbish from Cornish beaches with their family car, they posted a request for help on social media.  Nissan stepped forward and loaned them a brand-new Navara off-roader AT32 pick-up truck - complete with snorkel - to help with the hardest of tasks. On Constantine Bay, where Poldark is filmed, the Navara pulled out rope and plastic nets which had been buried deep into the sand for more than two years. Remote rocky beaches were easily negotiated and the off-roader\u0027s snorkel allowed it to wade through deep water without the engine cutting out.  Nissan has highlighted the hard work of Beach  to mark Friday’s World Oceans Day 2018 and celebrate UK community heroes tackling beach plastic pollution. During its recent Great British Beach Clean Up, the Marine Conservation Society found 718 pieces of litter for every 100 metre stretch of UK beach surveyed.  Rob Stevenson said: “The beaches people visit, where they enjoy ice-creams and watch  their kids build sandcastles, are just one view of the issue.   “There are many more remote and unseen parts of the coastline that volunteers either struggle to reach, or need something to move larger items.  “Normally we’re using just our own family cars or DIY tools. Without help from Nissan and  the Navara Off-Roader AT32, we could never have released the old nets buried in the  sand dunes for years.”  More than eight million tonnes of plastic end up in the world’s oceans every year with devastating consequences for marine wildlife, fisheries and tourism.  Nissan is now inviting community groups across Europe to nominate remote and tough-to-reach beaches or other locations where the Navara could help them clear plastic waste. And it is also encouraging its European employees to use its own volunteering program, Days for Change, to join local beach cleaning projects where appropriate.  In the UK, members of the public or community groups who want to highlight an area of beach that needs clearing of plastic waste should use the free ‘What3Words’ photo app to send an image of the beach plastic they\u0027ve found along with its precise location to Nissan GB at beachclean@nissan   What3Words is unique global addressing platform that allocates every 3m x 3m location with a simple three word address, e.g. ocean.plastic.waste. This address corresponds to a GPS location, which allows a specific spot on a beach to be identified and easily shared - even along the most rugged and remote coastlines. Ken Ramirez, senior vice president, sales and marketing, Nissan Europe, said: “The Navara Off-Roader AT32 is the perfect partner for Beach .

We are visiting the mosque that sounded the alarm, and later became a Grenfell rescue centre, with Jeremy Corbyn. The Labour leader was there to share Iftar, the breaking of the fast, with survivors, bereaved family members and volunteers. A year ago, worshippers returning from Ramadan prayers just before 1am were among the first to see smoke rising from the tower block. Some rushed into the building, others began ringing residents and raising the alarm. By daybreak, hundreds of survivors and volunteers were crammed into the mosque. It was an extraordinary sight, its simple kindness in stark contrast with the horror of the tower still burning in the sky. “A year ago, this was a site of panic,” says Bellal el Guenuni, a regular at the mosque, whose wife, three children and unborn baby miraculously survived the fire.  “Families didn’t know where to go. People had no clothes on their back, they were homeless, they were scared. The people who helped them were Muslim young people from this mosque, defying the stereotypes.” The mosque became a refuge, then a store for mass donations and a community hub. It held a delayed Eid celebration for the surviving children of Grenfell, bouncy castles and candyfloss afloat in a sea of grief. It held funeral prayers for Grenfell’s victims over coffins shrouded in green cloth. It was where Princes William and Harry comforted survivors and the bereaved. Where Meghan Markle made secret visits. Women stranded in hotels with their families met to cook meals here. The Labour leader had come to pay his respects a year on to the \u0026shyvolunteers who never stinted, and the bereaved and survivors who found their comfort here.  “We are gathered in the shadow of Grenfell where we remember that the difference between us is not about religion – but between those who have everything and those who have very little at all,” Corbyn told an audience invited by Labour’s Community Organising Unit and the Labour Muslim Network, before helping serve the Iftar meal in the room next door. “This Kensington borough is a microcosm of our society… But when I first came here, and the tower was still alight, you were already providing care and sustenance, and you are still supporting people now with counselling. There is no individual hero of Grenfell. The community as a whole is the hero.” After the Iftar meal, Jeremy Corbyn met Bellal and also Adel Chaoui, who lost his cousin Farah Hamdan, her husband Omar Belkadi and their baby Leena in the fire. Their daughter Malak died later in hospital, leaving only one young child, Tamzin, alive.  Adel’s petition, backed by Stormzy, forced a Commons debate that led to extra inquiry panel members being appointed. “My family died and we are never going to get them back,” Adel told the Labour leader. “But what I want to make sure is that Tamzin isn’t campaigning in 30 years’ time like the children of Hillsborough. I will not accept that for her.” Bellal asked Corbyn why he thought the Government was still failing to make the UK’s tower blocks safe. “We will all be housed one day,” he said, “but the bigger thing is, are other families safe?” The Labour leader compared the families’ fight to the campaign against asbestos. “We fought to get it removed for years even when the Government knew it was dangerous,” he said.

Experts from all over the world will form the Super Natural History team, carrying out DNA sampling of the waters.  Members will be drawing up a list of all life in the loch and making comparisons with other sites.  The study is being led by Professor Neil Gemmell, who said: Large fish like catfish and sturgeons have been suggested as possible explanations for the monster myth and we can very much test that idea and others. While the prospect of looking for evidence of the Loch Ness monster is the hook to this project, there is an extraordinary amount of new knowledge that we will gain from the work about organisms that inhabit Loch Ness - the UK\u0027s largest freshwater body.  Prof Gemmell, of the University of Otago, New Zealand, said he would be surprised if there\u0027s any evidence of DNA from a large extinct reptile - the so called Jurassic hypothesis. Professor Gemmell has assembled a team of global science leaders from the UK, Denmark, US, Australia and France, as well as Adrian Shine of the Loch Ness Project. The team is carrying out its investigation at the loch this month.  VisitScotland said the Nessie phenomenon is worth millions to the Scottish economy, with hundreds of thousands of visitors travelling to Loch Ness and Drumnadrochit every year to catch a glimpse of the mythical monster. Chris Taylor, VisitScotland regional leaderships director, said: The mystery and the intrigue of the Loch Ness monster attracts visitors from all over the world to the stunning area every year.

More than 10,000 gypsies and travellers are expected to attend the famous Appleby Horse Fair, arriving in style in traditional horse drawn carts on Tuesday. Two particular travellers caused long tailbacks with their unhurried mode of transport, leaving frustrated drivers in two mile long tailbacks. The two caravans moved along slowly towards the famous fair while more than 100 cars, lorries and vans built up behind them.  Members of the gypsy and traveller community have travelled from far and wide to attend the event, from all over the UK, Ireland and further afield. An additional 20,000 people are expected to attend for three days of trade, competition and festivities. More than 30 RSPCA officers have also been deployed to attend the fair, alongside fellow representatives from other equine charities.  Dating back to 1775, the event is an annual opportunity for travellers to showcase their horses and tell tales about life on the road. It became a major event in the 1900s when boxing and horse sales began to attract thousands. The event ballooned, becoming a key social event.  During the fair, the main road is closed to allow sellers to display their horses and each day horses are led to the River Eden to be washed and groomed. This ritual began in the 17th century as a way of making the horses more presentable for potential buyers at the pony market where breeds of all type are sold and traded.

Researchers carried out a detailed study of 2,000 adults in employment and found we all want more downtime. Half of those polled agreed waking up in the morning and dreading the day ahead at work is a sure-sign you need to address your work-life balance. And one third agreed struggling to sleep and finding yourself regularly in a bad mood are other common signs.  In an ideal world, employees agreed a dream existence would see adults dedicating just 30 per cent of their lives to work and the other 70 to life. Just one third believe they have already struck their perfect work-life balance. Work pressure and long hours were the most common factors cited as impacting work-life balance. Finally, the research has shown that half of the 20 most wanted perks are related to work-life balance and health issues.  Pietro Carmignani, CEO for Gympass UK \u0026amp Ireland , who commissioned the research, said “With this study, we wanted to understand the perception of workers when it comes to work-life balance and if they feel leading a more active live would offset issues of long hours and pressure at work.   “The results make it clear that physical activity is an urgent matter to employees and that companies have an opportunity and responsibility to help solve the imbalance.” Seventy-five per cent of employees polled agreed regular exercise is a key factor in achieving a good work-life balance. And nearly half said they find it easier to keep focused at work when they’ve hit the gym or made time for exercise. Thirty-five per cent wish they had more time for exercise in order to ‘bridge the gap’ between their work and home life. Three fifths reckoned they get their work done quicker and are more productive following a workout, meaning they are able to make more time for socialising, family and hobbies. UK employees would prefer fitness or gym-related employee benefits over good pension plans or company cars, both of which featured in the top five most common rewards currently among employers.

It was a big move for me.“Bobby Geddes (keeper coach) has been great and the gaffer has been brilliant because he’s put faith in me to put me on the bench and play me in the last game.“That’s the biggest thing for a goalkeeper, having the manager’s faith in you.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee man denies running off with a child in a buggy","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA man is to stand trial on

\u0026#8216S\u0026#8217 sitting outside his house.But after he sold it in October 1985, it took almost exactly 26 years for it to come full circle back to him.David said he always had an interest in cars and motorbikes but didn\u0026#8217t buy his first classic car until 1981 when his and his wife Maureen\u0026#8217s children were older.\u0026#8220When you were younger and first married you couldn\u0026#8217t afford to buy a second car, a classic car,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220As the family grow you then find you find you have a little more finances to indulge,\u0026#8221 Maureen added.He first bought the Mini Cooper \u0026#8216S\u0026#8217 on July 20, 1984 before selling it to a man in Meigle on October 9, 1985, but it was left in a state of disrepair and David said the last time he saw it was \u0026#8220sitting forlornly in a garden in Meigle\u0026#8221.David joined the Tayside Classic Car Club in 2001, when a work colleague suggested he come along to a meeting.\u0026#8220It started from there and then I started attending show with the club and I\u0026#8217ve been with them ever since, 17 years,\u0026#8221 he said.He didn\u0026#8217t hear anything of the Mini until Maurice Cruickshank from Arbroath joined the club and said he had a Cooper \u0026#8216S\u0026#8217 with the same registration as the one David used to own, which he had bought and extensively restored.So when Maurice said he was looking to sell it, David decided it was time to bring it back home again and he bought it October 7, 2011.The Kingsmuir couple now take it along to different shows with the club, of which David is now on the committee of while the couple share the duty of newsletter editor.The club was great as it accepted all different types of classic cars which suits the couple, who also have a 2001 Jaguar XJ8 Executive and a 1961 Hillman Minx 1500cc among their collection.\u0026#8220What you\u0026#8217ve said you like about it is there\u0026#8217s a big variety of vehicles,\u0026#8221 Maureen said to David.\u0026#8220When you go to a one make club you only talk about that one make of vehicle,\u0026#8221 David said.\u0026#8220I find it more interesting than a one make club.\u0026#8220You usually find someone who\u0026#8217s had that problem or knows someone so if you\u0026#8217re stuck for hint you can find someone.\u0026#8221David grew up in Kirriemuir, but said his father was originally from Cornwall and he had traced his roots back to Central Europe.\u0026#8220I went and did one of those DNA test,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220The results come back that I\u0026#8217m actually from around Germany and France\u0026#8220I kind of suspected that because I used to give blood and my blood group was European, but I\u0026#8217ve always lived in Scotland.\u0026#8221Maureen said they were quite well placed as they could visit the classic car shows both north and south of them.\u0026#8220Because people don\u0026#8217t tend to to travel long distance, when you go up Fraserburgh you tend to see a lot different vehicles up there than what you do here and the same when you go down south, you\u0026#8217ll see something different,\u0026#8221 she said.The couple are both preparing for the 13th Tayside Classic Motor Show, which is being held at Errol Airfield on Sunday, June 10, which they have been involved with for the last 12 years.\u0026#8220We\u0026#8217re hoping mother nature will be kind to us this year,\u0026#8221 Maureen said, after the event was called off last year due to rain.The show, which has donated £47,000 to various causes over the last 12 years, will display more than 600 vehicles have this year ranging from a 1927 Austin 7 to the more modern classics including a wide range of cars,

this week the existing turf has been lifted and a process known as vertical sand-banding started.While that’s a complicated, as well as expensive, process, the new and improved pitch will be ready

He’ll seem like a new signing if he can rediscover the form that helped Hamilton, Hearts and Hibs gain promotion to the top flight.Verdict: Looking good up top.Overall: With just 18 first-team players on the books, work is obviously still to be done but initial signs look promising. Adding solid defenders, however, is vital.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0d1daf5c232.jpg ","title":"va jobs nearly 500 apply for visitor

Market.Since taking up the role of market manager six months ago, Jo Murray has been exploring ways in which the historic site\u0027 future viability can be secured as well as meeting traders and other interested groups regularly.Suggestions, which have now been put forward, include extending opening hours, revamping shop fronts and hosting events as well as taking a radical look at the how the market hall section might be remodelled in a bid to attract local residents to shop at the historic landmark.\"The Victorian Market is very much loved by the local community but the local community doesn\u0026rsquot necessarily use it,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We need to encourage local customers to come in and shop.\"Under the action plan, a proposed programme of work is set be carried out in three phases.The first priority is to refurbish the stonework at the market\u0027 Academy Street entrance and replace the glass door.\"It is a really iconic entrance,\" Mrs Murray said.\"But I think it is recognised the smoked glass which has been installed is a bit of a visual barrier to the market. The intention is to change it to clear glass and make it more attractive entrance.\"The next phase would be to\u0026nbsp refurbish the shop fronts in Market Arcade and make them more in keeping with the building.It is hoped both phases will be able to secure funding from the Academy Street Townscape Heritage Project to regenerate that area of the city centre.With that funding due to finish in 2020, the proposed improvements are at the top of the list of priorities on the market action plan.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe third phase focuses on the market hall itself.\"This is the area potentially most subject to change,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are going to look at having a feasibility study done to see what is physically possible and how much can be developed to create a better and more usable space, better units and a better environment.\"One idea, for example, is to look at whether a mezzanine floor would be possible.\"We also want to try and create a more open area which we could use as a venue, Mrs Murray said.She is particularly keen to see more cafes and restaurants and food units while zoned areas such as a restaurant quarter or a jewellery hub are another possibility.Rents could also be set according to whether units are assessed to be in a strong or weak location.Of the 36 units, 32 are currently occupied and there has\u0026nbsp also been interest from other prospective tenants.\"The Victorian Market is quite unique in Inverness and we need to exploit that,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are trading healthily but we want to maximise our potential.

It will also incorporate the North tower, which has been open to the public as a viewing platform for more than a year and Inverness Museum and Art Gallery.Locals and tourists can also look forward to new galleries which will host national and international exhibitions, displays celebrating the creativity and beauty of the Highlands as well as \"retail and catering\" which showcase the best of what the region has to offer.\u0026nbspA new hotel could also be created as part of the makeover.The project is to be part-funded by \u0026pound1.5 million from the \u0026pound15 million Scottish Government contribution to the Inverness-Highland City-Region Deal.The remainder will involve hefty borrowing by the council although it said it would benefit from the rents of the various businesses in the existing buildings.Speaking at the castle Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing, co-chairman of the steering group overseeing the castle redevelopment, said the investment would support economic growth and create a \"sustainable, viable and must-see attraction to celebrate the spirit of the Highlands\".He added: \"It will create a once in a generation opportunity for future redevelopment for the city and the Highlands to create something of high architectural value \u0026ndash precisely the opposite of the existing buildings.\"Equally thrilled council leader Margaret Davidson said: \"This has been a long-held ambition.\"It will help us achieve our vision for this iconic site and Inverness Castle\u0027 place as part of a range of tourism assets this region has to offer.\"Highland planning director Stuart Black confirmed the purchase price was \"over \u0026pound5 million\", adding: \"We\u0026rsquore still in final discussions with the owner but it will be agreed by the end of June and then we\u0026rsquoll release the purchase price.\"He said the options for the site were to renovate, to redevelop partially \u0026ndash perhaps by removing the upper deck \u0026ndash or what he termed \"comprehensive redevelopment\".Project manager Graham Watson, of High Life Highland, said: \"It\u0027 a one-off opportunity for Inverness to really look at how it see its future for Castlehill.\"The attraction envisaged for the castle will promote the Highlands\u0027 \"creativity, wellbeing, culture, heritage and natural environment\".Friday 8 Jun 2018 1:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04043000/04043681.jpg","title":"Yellow peril told to look the other way","story":"\u0026nbspTRAFFIC wardens have been ordered not to slap fines on motorists in an Inverness\u0026nbspstreet \u0026ndash because the parking signs are invalid and council workers are too busy fixing potholes to find time to take them down.The \"yellow peril\" has been instructed to turn a blind eye on Greig Street until a maintenance team can get round to putting up correct signage.The move has left B\u0026ampB owners scratching their heads wondering how they can convince their guests to ignore the signs and assure them they will not get a ticket.\"Surely the council can do better than that,\" said Acer Glen Guest House owner Stephen Bowsher.\"I can quite believe they\u0026rsquore busy fixing potholes but are they really expecting me to turn around to a guest and say \u0026lsquoI know what the signs say but that\u0027 OK, you can just ignore it?

Loan midfielders Ryan Christie (Celtic), Greg Stewart (Birmingham), Dominic Ball (Rotherham) and Chidi Nwakali (Manchester City) have all returned to their parent clubs.Midfielder Greg Tansey, who still has two years left on his Dons deal, has been told he is free to find another club this summer.Tansey spent the second half of the recent season on loan at Ross County.McInnes insists that in Forrester he has landed a player who can feature in a number of midfield roles.He said: “Chris is a player who has always caught my eye.“He can play in a variety of positions.“He handles the ball extremely well and he will bring us flexibility in the midfield area.“We’ve been aware of him for a while and hopefully he sees Aberdeen as an opportunity to give impetus to his career. “I’m delighted to welcome him to the club.”McInnes has also targeted Hibs’ out-of-contract midfielder Dylan McGeouch.Aberdeen have offered McGeouch the opportunity to be the highest-paid player at Pittodrie.However, Hibs have also pitched in with a late offer in a bid to re-sign the midfielder who earned his debut Scotland cap during the recent friendlies in South America.Rangers have joined the race to land McGeouch.English championship sides QPR, Fulham, Blackburn and Brentford are also tracking him and can offer higher wages.Aberdeen have also targeted Ross County right-back Jason Naismith.The 23-year-old is a target for Burton Albion and Plymouth Argyle.Naismith has two years left on his contract with the relegated Staggies and would require a transfer fee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen road could be shut for six days as thousands of homes left without water1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThousands of properties were left without water today and roads and schools were closed after a water main burst.The problem, on West Tullos Road in Aberdeen, is affecting homes, businesses and schools in the AB11 and AB12 postcodes in Torry and Kincorth.The road – one of the city’s busiest – is expected to be closed until Wednesday evening as Scottish Water carries out repairs.A spokeswoman for the utility firm said: “Traffic management is in place while repairs are carried out and water has been re-routed through unaffected parts of our network to restore supplies to as many customers as possible.“We would like to apologise to those experiencing disruption and thank them for their patience while we work to restore normal service.”Around 4,500 properties were hit by the water outage and three schools – Abbotswell Primary, Walker Road Primary, and Torry Academy – were forced to close their doors to pupils.Mark Wylie, activities manager at the Jump In Trampoline Park on Craigshaw Road, said: “So far, we are okay because we have enough water in the tank, but we haven’t gotten an update in a while.“Scottish Water said the water would be back on by 9am, but it’s not. So we’re waiting for an update.”A spokesman for the council said: “West Tullos Road is also closed to north-westbound traffic between Abbotswell Road and King George VI Bridge Roundabout due to the burst.

harbour","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA north-east Boys’ Brigade is making a bid to clean up a town’s harbour – with a unique piece of equipment.Members of the 1st Fraserburgh Boys’ Brigade have so far raised £900 to purchase a Seabin for the town’s harbour.The piece of equipment costs £3,000 and can be submerged to collect waste 24 hours a day using a pump to suck rubbish from the sea surface.The idea came from warrant officer Grant Duthie, who saw the environmentally-friendly piece of equipment advertised online.Officers at the company are delighted with the amount raised so far.Warrant officer in the company section Ryan Clark said: “We wanted to do a fundraiser for something a bit different, hence the choice of the Seabin.“It was originally suggested through our president’s badge boys’ meeting by Grant Duthie, who also volunteers for the local lifeboat crew and it went from there.“It’s now a company section goal to raise the money through various fundraisers, such as coffee mornings, sponsored sports challenges and other events.“Originally, our plan was to raise the money over a couple of years, but with the speed that we’ve raised funds already, we hope to have it done in maybe over a year or so.”Once the Seabin is full it can be emptied and the contents recycled.It can catch everything floating in the water, including plastic bottles, paper and fuel.Fish are not caught because they do not get close enough to the surface to be pulled in.Clean water is then pumped back into the sea, helping to keep pollution levels down.The group, one of three Boys’ Brigade companies in the town, has already approached the harbour with the idea.Marc Thomson, officer in the company section, added that the efforts will count towards the boys’ badge work.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/5b18c9aca131f-783x564.jpg ","title":"charity calls for four historic aberdeen buildings to be saved","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA charity has called for four historic north-east buildings to be saved.Conservation group SAVE Britain’s Heritage has branded the notable properties in Aberdeen, including Westburn House, as “vulnerable”.The group aims to champion decaying properties and publishes an annual Buildings at Risk catalogue – which this year also contains two buildings on Union Street and one close to the harbour.Liz Fuller, SAVE’s Building at Risk officer, said: “All over the country there are countless numbers of disused historic buildings which could be revived with new uses to ensure their survival.“In preparing this year’s buildings at risk catalogue, Revive and Survive, we have unearthed a treasure trove of beautiful buildings which tell the story of this country but need action to be taken if they are to survive.”Four out of the 100 buildings on the list mentioned are in Aberdeen, with Westburn House in Westburn Park featured.The property was built in the 1830s for David Chalmers, editor of the Aberdeen Journal, who commissioned Archibald Simpson to design it.The renowned architect created some of the Granite City’s most historic buildings.The property and park were acquired by the town council in 1901 and were used as changing and refreshment rooms for the nearby sports facilities, before becoming a nursery.It has also served as a health clinic.Peter Stephen, chairman of the Friends of Victoria and Westburn Park, said: “Because of the building’s status it cannot be dem-olished.“We have been trying for many years to get someone to come in and take it on.“And I think by now parts of the roof have fallen in and the area has been fenced off.“The building has a very, very, interesting history and we have thought it would have been great as a registry office, since the area would make a great wedding facility.”Mr Stephen said he was delighted SAVE Britain’s Heritage had taken note of the building adding he “would encourage someone to take on the house”.The Category A-listed building has been vacant since 1998 and its condition has gradually deteriorated.Councillors had approved plans by Elgin-based company Liberty Kids in 2016 to turn it into a modern nursery, but the lease recently fell through.The organisation has labelled the Victorian landmark’s condition as “very poor” and its risk as “high”.Councillor Tom Mason, who represents the Midstocket and Rosemount area, said: “It’s a classical building and I think if we can find a proper use for it, it can be restored to its former glory.“It would be good to attract the correct person to get the funding into place and get a champion who will restore Westburn House.“Anything in that direction would be absolutely fantastic.”Other properties featured are 156 Union Street which stands on the city’s main shopping street. It is described as being “made of granite and has three storeys with attic and cellars and a large shop window on to the street”.The report also features the building at 226-228 Union Street, classed as a commercial property and listed as Category C.Its ground and upper floors are currently for sale.Finally, it lists 2 Commerce Lane, which was built in the early 19th Century, was once a townhouse near the city’s harbour and has been “vacant for some time”.Liz said: “It has been vacant for some time and is in urgent need of repair, with both chimneys and the tops of the gables having previously been removed.“It stands in an area which has a variety of business and office accommodation as well as some residential properties.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/Murcar-Links-700px.jpg ","title":"all eyes on royal aberdeen for the 123rd amateur championship","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn international field of 288 elite men’s amateur golfers will descend on the North East of Scotland later this month all possessing one aim – to lift The Amateur Championship trophy and with it secure a spot in The 147th Open at Carnoustie in July.Golfers from 38 countries across Europe, Asia-Pacific, Africa and the Americas will tee it up at Royal Aberdeen and Murcar Links when The 123rd Amateur Championship takes place there for the first time from 18-23 June 2018.England’s Harry Ellis won the title last year in dramatic fashion, battling back from four holes down with five to play in the 36-hole final at Royal St George’s.As a result of his victory, Ellis played in The Open at Royal Birkdale, took part in the 2018 Masters Tournament and will shortly head to Shinnecock Hills for this year’s US Open.That commitment will prevent Ellis from defending his Amateur title in Aberdeen but an impressive list boasting some of the best in the amateur game are ready to etch their name in history and grasp the career changing opportunities that go to the winner.One player who knows how valuable those opportunities are is 2002 champion Alejandro Larrazabal, who will be competing at Royal Aberdeen as a reinstated amateur.Norway’s Victor Hovland is the highest-ranked player in the field at 5th in the World Amateur Golf RankingTM (WAGRTM). The 21-year-old plays college golf at Oklahoma State in the United States and moved into the top ten in March after winning the Valspar Collegiate.Just behind Hovland in the ranking and also set for Aberdeen is England’s Matthew Jordan (6th). The 2017 GB\u0026ampI Walker Cup player solidified his position amongst the elite of amateur golf by capturing the Lytham Trophy with a nine-shot victory at the beginning of May.The Royal Liverpool member will be eager to make it a hat-trick of English winners and follow in the footsteps of his Walker Cup teammates Ellis and Scott Gregory, who lifted the trophy in 2016 at Royal Porthcawl.Jordan was also recently named in a 20-man Great Britain and Ireland squad in preparation for the 2018 St Andrews Trophy match against the Continent of Europe at Linna Golf in Finland in July.Selected alongside him and set to tee it up in The Amateur is Scotland’s Sam Locke who will look to use home advantage to become the first Scottish champion since Bradley Neil defeated Zander Lombard in the final at Royal Portrush in 2014.Locke, the current Scottish Amateur champion, plays out of nearby Stonehaven Golf Club and will be targeting a top finish in front of a local crowd.Sandy Scott from Nairn returns to his homeland to play his part in Aberdeen. Progressing through a golf scholarship at Texas Tech University, the former Scottish Golf 2015 Boys Order of Merit winner qualified for the Scottish Open at Dundonald Links last July.He will be looking to go one better and book his place at The Open with a win at Royal Aberdeen come Saturday evening.Defeated 2018 finalist Dylan Perry returns to The Amateur Championship for another shot at the title. The Australian, who is ranked 20th in the world, came agonisingly close to lifting the trophy after surrendering a four hole lead to Ellis last year.A strong group from the Asia-Pacific region will join Perry including top-ranked countrymen David Micheluzzi (17th) and Shae Wools Cobb (26th).

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity.

Scottish mussels are best eaten outside the spawning season.Other seafood suppliers have also had to halt mussel production early.\u0026#8216It is very important to us to farm mussels responsibly,\u0026#8217 said managing director Cameron Brown.\u0026#8216This sunshine has been lovely but the heat has made our mussels think it’s summer already and to start spawning. That means they need to be left alone to recover condition over the summer months. We also avoid summer harvesting because of the risk of toxic algae due to elevated phytoplankton levels in the loch.\u0026#8217\u0026#8216In the meantime we\u0026#8217ll be carrying out essential maintenance and collecting the \u0026#8216baby\u0026#8217 mussels \u0026#8211 or spats.

The council believes this will make the process faster and easier for people thinking about building their own home.A community information and feedback event will be held on Wednesday June 6 at Lochgilphead Community Centre from 1pm to 6.30pm, with presentations scheduled for 2pm and 5.30pm.Anyone interested in the Simplified Planning Zones is invited to attend and will be able to ask questions, get involved in shaping the design and find out much more about each of the proposed sites. The events are as much about getting input and feedback from the community as they are about offering information on the Simplified Planning Zone sites.David Kinniburgh, the council’s policy lead for planning and regulatory services, said: \u0026#8216The idea behind the Simplified Planning Zones is to remove obstacles for people who want to build custom or self-build homes. There will be a lot of great information available at these events and I would encourage everyone with an interest to attend and find out more about the proposals.\u0026#8217More information is available by email on spz@argyll-bute.gov.uk or by calling 01546 604158.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"thousands of entries set for royal highland show","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 01/06/18, 9:40 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe UK\u0026#8217s premier agricultural show will once again showcase the country\u0026#8217s finest livestock, as thousands of animals vie for the honour of being crowned champion.Organisers of the event Royal Highland Show, supported by The Royal Bank of Scotland, are preparing for what will be an exceptional display of livestock, with well over 5,000 entries for all sections of the show.The Highland Hall will again be at maximum capacity, housing almost 1,100 beef and dairy cattle, with commercial cattle recording their highest number for entries in the last decade, standing at 93 animals up from 75 last year, an increase of almost 25 per cent.With 104 entries, the Shorthorns are set to dominate this year, up from 88 entries in 2017. The Simmentals are hot on their heels with 103 entries, a 10-year record  and an increase from 85 in 2017. And the Charolais are also seeing a resurgence, with a jump to 76, from 61 last year.The numbers in the dairy section total 109 entries, with the largest class being the Ayrshire with 38, up from 29 in 2017. Holsteins total 29 entries, and the Dairy Shorthorn class has seen numbers more than double from 12 to 25. This year\u0026#8217s Queen\u0026#8217s Cup will be in the dairy class.Sheep entries once again command the Royal Highland Show with 2,029 animals making this the second largest number of entries in more than a decade.Leading the way is the Texel section with 182 entries, with the Beltex close behind with 177. Elsewhere in the sheep classes, the Suffolks have their highest number in 10 years with 110 entries (90 in 2017). The Ryelands and the Rouges also see record numbers for the last decade, with 82 and 39 entries respectively (up from 65 and 34 in 2017). Commercial sheep entries are also seeing increased interest with 104 entries, up from 85 in 2017.  The North of England Mule class was introduced to the Show in 2011 and sees its highest ever entries, with 69 in the class.The Young Handler competition has 56 entries, illustrating the continued interest from the next generation particularly in this the Year of Young People.An exciting development is the interest in the goat classes with a ten-year high of 39 entries and the Boer breed, increasing from 16 to 27.  Six goat young handlers will also compete for the title.1,665 entries have been received in the light horse section, with the HOYS qualifying Mountain and Moorland Under Saddle section again dominating with 197 entries, up from 192 in 2017.The Heavy Horse section continues to have a strong presence, with 392 entries. Highland females lead the way with 94, with Shetland females closely behind with 84.In 2009 the show separated the Welsh C and Welsh D classes due to increasing demand, and that has proved to be winning formula with record entries again this year, with 43 and 59 respectively.Royal Highland Show Manager David Jackson, said: \u0026#8216The Highland continues to be the leading event for showcasing the very best the livestock industry has to offer, and it extremely rewarding that the industry continues to recognise its importance as a platform for the sector.\u0026#8216We continue to see very strong entries, with increasing numbers in many sections, especially in the commercial classes, and I know we will see some fierce competition for a winning place.\u0026#8216As an event, we grow year on year and attract new audiences as we widen the appeal for visitors from town and country. Yet we remain true to our roots as an agricultural show and work hard to be truly relevant to all aspects of farming and rural life.\u0026#8216The Grand Parade always proves to be a high point of the show and gives us a chance to celebrate the commitment and dedication of all our cattle and heavy horse exhibitors. I recommend everyone to make time to observe this truly spectacular display.\u0026#8216The team look forward to welcoming all our exhibitors, from the Scottish islands to South West England to Northern Ireland. They are dedicated to their craft, and I am extremely grateful for their continued support and wish them all the best of luck.\u0026#8217Supported by Royal Bank of Scotland, the 178th Royal Highland Show will take place at the Royal Highland Centre, Ingliston, Edinburgh, on June 21-24.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 26","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 02/06/18, 3:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.What a spell of weather we have had over the past week and more.Knowing the Argyll climate, by the time you read this you might be sitting in a blizzard in front of the fire enjoying your paper but it was good while it lasted.Welcome as it is, warm weather brings its own problems.

These had a variety of riding and control of paces challenges including an unusual off piste element using the quarry area of the field.Judge Debbie Hay Thorburn was very impressed with the independent riding of the youngest members who tackled all the tasks with confidence and determination.

In fact many of the passing ferry passengers stopped to watch from the road.The new timing equipment, purchased with aid of a grant from Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust, was in full use by judge Mairi Henderson and made for more professional accuracy in timing aspects.The final Grand Prix had only two competitors but it was a masterclass of style and competence from Jojo and Katie which made it a joy to watch.As usual the event ended with some fast and exciting games and after the field was cleared there was the prizegiving in the Pony Club’s brand new blue tent.The Junior Trophy for the day was won by Louise Ralston from Campbeltown and Iris McMillan from Tayvallich took the Senior Trophy for a second year while the non-members trophy was won by Andrea McShannon.Pony Club PonyClass 11 Frazer Prentice, Firefly2 Louise Ralston, Nero3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceClass 21 Willow Ryan, Ryan2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, ColeyClass 31 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Katie MacKay, Eva3 Josephine Boase, ValerieClass 41 Andrea McShannon, Nicole2 Julie McLeish, Eclipse3 Shelagh Oakes, Pery4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyShow JumpingStars of the Future \u0026#8211 Lead Rein1 Louise Ralston, Nero2 Frazer Prentice, Firefly3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceStars of the Future1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, Coley4 Willow Ryan, RyanNewcomers1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Michelle McAloon, Eclipse4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyDiscovery1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Katie MacKay, Eva4 Michelle McAloon, EclipseGrand Prix1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Katie MacKay, Eva\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"springwatch spotlight on tarbert","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 07/06/18, 12:17 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert has featured on the popular BBC nature show Springwatch.An underwater segment stirred up a buzz on social media with its inside look at the colourful world just beneath the waves.Diver and cameraman Andy Jackson took to the bottom of Loch Fyne to view what he called ‘an underwater garden’ and the wonderful creatures within.The segment was aired on Tuesday June 5 and is available on BBC iPlayer for a limited period.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/06/18, 4:46 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.This week\u0026#8217s photograph comes from Jacqui Barker of Tarbert.

The ‘Highway Services’ would be located at Bogend Toll near Symington and could create 30 jobs. A Shell petrol station and Londis shop are part of the vision for the site. A raft of documents have been lodged with South Ayrshire Council as part of a planning application. London-based Grove Garages is behind the proposal, which would see two buildings erected.   The company has an agreement with Shell and Londis but is still in talks to sign-up a coffee firm.  The plan includes eight fuel pumps, 11 parking spaces, two car wash bays and pumps for HGVs.  The coffee shop would have a floor space of 260sqm with 29 car spaces and a drive through at the back. A supporting statement said: “The location of the site represents an ideal opportunity for a roadside servies area to cater for the frequent tourist, haulage and commuter traffic using the A77. It said the development would ensure the “reuse of a visually and environmentally poor site in a prominent location alongside one of Scotland’s main tourist routes, the A77.”  The site used to be a field belonging to Dyke Farm. Access to the site would be from the B730 adjoining the A77 north bound carriageway. Cars could enter from the southbound carriageway through the existing flyover. Chargers would also be available for electric cars. A design and access statement said: “The proposals give back purpose to an unused site, which has potential to provide an important service to the local area and indeed the wider area. The design proposals are considered to be respectful to the local environment and are in line with local policy and guidelines. No decision has been made on the application yet.

Following a long battle with neuroblastoma, the 17-year-old died peacefully surrounded by dad Chris, mum Connie, and sister Olivia. It was a fight that captured not just the hearts and minds of Ayrshire, but the world beyond. Vanessa, who displayed courage which belied her condition, would rarely be seen without a smile on her face. For almost a decade, her name became synonymous with the fight against the aggressive cancer. Almost \u0026pound1million was raised with the aim of sending Vanessa abroad for life-saving treatment. That dream was realised and in January 2013, the family received the news they longed for – that the cancer was in remission.  Vanessa would return to school and rejoin classmates as a hugely popular figure at Marr College. Life, as normal as it could ever be, was good again for this inspirational girl. But the cancer would return and spread to Vanessa’s brain, with her family receiving the crushing news that her condition was terminal. As ever, Vanessa fought bravely until the last before she passed away just days short of her 18th birthday. Now her family are vowing that her fight will live on in her legacy. Dad Chris told the Post: “We are devastated at our loss.  “Vanessa was a huge inspiration to Connie, Olivia and I and so many more. “She achieved lots during her short but fulfilled life, she did everything she wanted to do and lived life to the full. “She never complained about anything, even though her situation was dire and she knew it. “We are privileged to have had such an inspirational and beautiful daughter.”  Vanessa’s funeral will take place on Friday, June 22 at 11.30am at Dreghorn Crematorium and then on to Troon Town Hall for a Celebration of Life. Chris added: “We’d like to ask that people wear bright colours and for the gents not to wear black ties. “That is what Vanessa would have wanted.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12539593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/14478946.jpg","title":"lawrence shankland agrees new deal","story":"NewsLawrence Shankland agrees new deal to stay at Ayr United for Championship pushThe 29-goal striker has put pen to paper on a new deal at Somerset Park.\u0026nbspShareByStuart WilsonLochlin Highet13:14, 15 MAY 2018Updated13:18, 15 MAY 2018NewsShankland is staying on at Somerset (Image: Daily Record)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLawrence Shankland insists money can’t buy happiness after he sensationally spurned a host of lucrative offers to pen a new deal at Ayr United. The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club.

The couple now live in Kilmarnock. “We actually met about 15 years ago when both of us used to go ice skating at the Magnum on a Friday night,” said Kim. The pair lost touch over the years but were reunited six years ago. Kim said: “We started chatting as friends but it became apparent the spark was definitely still there between us and a few months later we moved in together. “It was a whirlwind romance - within a year of meeting we had moved in together, got engaged and had a beautiful baby boy.  “We then had another baby in 2016 and it was then we decided to start planning the wedding.” The couple tied the knot at The Vu in Bathgate on Mother’s Day, March 11 this year. Kim said: “We were a bit panicky about the weather as the week before the wedding was storm Edna and everyone was snowed in. “There was still some snow lying around on the wedding day but the sun was shining. “The wedding day was an emotional day from start to finish it was full of tears and laughter and genuinely was the best day of our lives!” The bride wore a Maggie Sottero ‘Lisette’ dress from Opus Couture in West Kilbride, as well as veil and hair piece. The kilts were from MacGregor \u0026amp MacDuff in Prestwick.  The couple’s wedding party consisted of flowergirls - Daughters, Macie O’Donnell and Evie McLauchlan and bride’s sister Molly Miller Page boys were son, Alfie McLauchlan and bride’s brother Jack Miller and the best man was Groom’s brother-in-law, Richard Hunter. Kim continued: “We haven’t managed to get away on a honeymoon yet as we have three children so picking a destination has been quite difficult! “We do plan on going somewhere we just haven’t decided where yet.” KSG Photography captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with beautiful photos to look back on. Claire’s Crystal Brides arranged the bouquets with Ashley Nimmo and Jett Patterson of Allure Hair \u0026amp Beauty, Kilmarnock created the hair and beauty looks for the day. Kim added: “Our cake was made by a friend who is a cake maker, Diane Kay. “We didn’t really have a clue about a cake so we just sent Diane some pictures and trusted her to make us a gorgeous cake and we were not disappointed!  “We had a white three tier cake with silver and diamant\u0026eacute lace trim, it fitted the wedding theme perfectly and was absolutely delicious.” The couple added: “Thanks to all the staff at the Vu for an absolutely amazing day. “Kevin the photographer, Waterfront the band, Winton Weddings for our stunning decor, Susan from Opus Couture for helping me chose my stunning dress and all our friends and family who attended the wedding and made it the most perfect special day! “My best friend, Shelby McAllister for being right by my side for the full day and keeping me calm in the lead up to the wedding. “And last but not least - my Grampa Willie for walking me down the aisle and making all my dreams come true!” For more photos of this week’s Wedding of the Week, pick up your copy of the Ayrshire Post.

They’re celebrating 20 years since leaving school with a party at the Marine Hotel. And organisers are hoping Ayrshire Post readers can track down some pupils they cannot find. The group all started in 1992 and would have all left by 1998. Joint organiser Lynda Hardman said: “We’ve managed to make contact with a lot of them but some are missing. “It’s been 20 years since we left school and I thought a wee reunion would be a good excuse to get together and have a fun night with good food, friends and some old classic 90s tunes.  “We want a night to reconnect and reminisce.” They are also calling on any teachers of the era who could face meeting up with some of their young charges again. They have booked the Marine Hotel on Saturday, July 28 and ex-pupil and DJ Steven James will spin the decks. Lynda added: “Many people have their tickets already, some who live locally like Vicki Cameron, some from a bit further afield, like Ed and Kim Wood (Carmichael) and others are travelling from outside Scotland like Hannah Izod (Green) who now lives in England, Neil Lockie of Florida and John Brisco in Hong Kong.” Tickets costing \u0026pound25 include three-course meal and welcome drink and can be bought at the website marr92 and Lynda and fellow organiser Mhairi Lammie were on the yearbook committee of the time and are seeking photos for a slide show to be sent to atreunion1992@outlook "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12662348.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/lhr_ayp_010618dom.jpg","title":"prestwick tennis superstar learning disability","story":"NewsPrestwick tennis superstar with learning disability climbed Goat Fell for charityDominic Iannotti, who is number one in the world for his tennis category, made it to the top of the 2867ft peak on Arran.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet14:45, 7 JUN 2018NewsDominic Iannotti Prestwick Tennis player (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRising tennis star Dominic Iannotti made a mountain of cash by climbing Goat Fell. The 20-year-old from Prestwick, who is number one in the world for his tennis category, made it to the top of the 2867ft peak on Arran. Dominic was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, which is on the autism spectrum, at a young age and is part of the Great Britain Learning Disability tennis team. After three years in the sport, he is number one in the world for his doubles category and number three in the world for singles. He competes in the mainstream tennis ranks and is in the top 10 for the South/West Scotland overall. He is currently part of an apprenticeship at Prestwick Tennis Fitness Club and is close to achieving his level three coaching badges that would allow him to coach anywhere in the world. Dominic’s dad, Anthony, who runs the Iannotti Bros cash and carry, could not be more proud of him. The 50-year-old, from Prestwick, said: “Dominic was diagnosed at a young age. We tried all kinds of things but nothing seemed to help. “My wife went online and found children’s charity Bibic and we spoke to them. They were a godsend and they guided us and helped Dominic through a lot.    Since then we haven’t looked back and he has became a fantastic kid.  “You would never know he had this syndrome and that’s credit to the hard work done.” Dominic decided to give something back to the charities that have helped him over the years. He climbed Goat Fell with a group of friends and raised \u0026pound810 for Bibic and South Ayrshire Autistic Society. Anthony said: “We are very proud of him. “A lot of people now do fundraising for national charities but the local ones don’t get as much exposure or sponsors. We wanted to help Bibic as they were instrumental in helping the way Dominic is today and SAAS helped Dominic from a very young age.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"south ayrshire council bosses urged","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire Council bosses urged to throw Ayr United a title partyCalls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson12:11, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United title celebrations (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil bosses have been urged to throw Ayr United’s champions an official party. Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"thousands pounds pocketed council after","story":"NewsThousands of pounds pocketed by council after secret VAT grabBut they’ve been caught out by golfers incensed South Ayrshire Council has not passed on any benefit of a government zero VAT ruling on leisure.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston14:18, 6 JUN 2018NewsCouncillor Peter Convery brands move on VAT “sleekit”\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThousands of pounds is being pocketed by a council after a secret VAT grab. But they’ve been caught out by golfers incensed South Ayrshire Council has not passed on any benefit of a government zero VAT ruling on leisure. In February HMRC announced there was to be no VAT on council provided leisure activities. And that will include swimming, gym use and bowling at Northfield. But South Ayrshire Council has not let any of its customers know. If effectively means golf charges have soared 24% on last year, rather than the 2.7% the council have boasted about. It means that golfers paying the \u0026pound429 season ticket price would be expecting a \u0026pound71.50 reduction for VAT.  Tory councillor Peter Convery is blasting the move as “sleekit.” And he said: “Surely people are entitled to get some money paid back to them? “This is about principle and this is sleekit. “This is peoples’ money and should never have been included in the original ticket charge. “It is very unfortunate the council cannot see this to any great extent.” In East Ayrshire, where leisure is provided by an arm’s length trust, VAT is necessary on charges. Details of the VAT grab emerged in an email between a golfer and Councillor Brian McGinley.  The golfer, who preferred to remain anonymous, said: “I do not think the majority of season ticket holders will be enamoured to discover that a significant element of their season ticket fee is actually related to a cost that SAC no longer have to bear.” Ayr East councillor McGinley said in the email: “I have ascertained that VAT has been included within the price of a season ticket up until February 18 this year. “Following a court ruling against HMRC whereby sports services provided by local authorities are now classed as exempt for VAT purposes, VAT is no longer remitted to HMRC when income is received for season tickets etc.” A council spokesman would not explain why they had not revealed the VAT windfall, if players can expect a refund or whether is was just being used to mask a huge leap in prices.  He would only say: “We work hard to ensure our golf and leisure provision continues to offer great value for local people and visitors and this is reflected in our current charging structure. “The funding from entry fees and season tickets only makes a partial contribution to our overall operating costs – with the remainder coming directly from Council subsidy – and the 2.7% price increase on last year’s fees reflects the Consumer Price Index. “Reducing inequalities within our communities is a key commitment for the Council and we have extended the concessions available under the Access to Leisure card scheme – which includes a 15% discount for all South Ayrshire residents. The change in VAT application for Council leisure services contributes towards the costs of that important scheme, which will help improve health and wellbeing across South Ayrshire, as well as helping reduce the net deficit cost of running Council leisure services, which was almost \u0026pound11 million in 2016/17.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"troon church help build new","story":"NewsTroon church to help build new school for hurricane victimsThe Troon church has raised £170,000 to help transform people’s lives in Haiti.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley14:28, 7 JUN 2018NewsPastor Richard Woods with Minister Rolex visiting Muirhead Primary (Image: Copyright unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Building a school for hurricane victims was once a dream for Seagate Church.

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it. Laird Girdwood, was a larger-than-life character and also one of the prominent proprietors. He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade. Meanwhile James Ker lived with his wife at Red Lion House in Biggiesknowe. Their toft was more than half an acre in size with a barn whose gable end faced the street and a single-storey cottage attached. Parts of the barn were rebuilt\ninto a new dwelling house.\nThe barn itself is not without interest being the one scene of Laird Girdwood\u0026rsquos Venison Feast to which all the residents of the Northgate were invited everyone, however, to bring his own beverage.\nIt was a resounding success\u0026mdash\u0026ldquoNever before did the rafters ring with such glee. was the reported account of the event.\nA traditional forge and a modern purpose-built engineering workshop were built as well as a \u0026lsquospec\u0026rsquo tenement of four dwellings.\nWrought iron work was much in evidence, with a large garden behind and a rustic rockery at the front of the property. It was then given the name \u0026lsquoKer Place\u0026rsquo after the fashion of the time for such businessmen of which there are several examples in Peebles.\nThe cottage (pre 1823), which is still in place, became part of the enterprise and judging by the size of the lathe bed and fire-scorched rafters some serious work went on there.\nIt also incorporated James Ker\u0026rsquos dispensary for his veterinary work. James had been a student of William Dick at his Edinburgh Veterinary College which he had established at his father\u0026rsquos forge in Clyde Street in Edinburgh where the bus station now stands.\nHe obtained his diploma to practice as a veterinary surgeon and was also made a Fellow of the Edinburgh Medical Veterinary Society for his \u0026ldquovaluable contribution to veterinary science. This may have been in connection with a product he sold commercially as \u0026lsquoKer\u0026rsquos Alterative Sheep Pill\u0026rsquo.\nIt must have been effective since it was still being sold in the 1930s by his son, John Ker. He, also a blacksmith, had qualified as a veterinary surgeon nearly forty years after his father at what was by then called the Royal \u0026ldquoDick Veterinary College.\nJames and his wife died at a young age and his brother and sister, Charles and Elizabeth, carried on the business successfully as well as raising James\u0026rsquos family of two boys.\nJohn Ker, as said, served his apprenticeship as a blacksmith and also qualified as a veterinary surgeon. About 1916 the smiddy closed when the farriers went to war.\nJohn Ker served as a captain with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and on his return practiced locally as a veterinary surgeon until he died after a short illness towards the end of 1938. The smiddy, itself, \u0026ldquodid its bit during hostilities, by billeting troops.\nIt did not reopen after the war and operate at its former level of business as blacksmiths and engineers. It did, however, remain in general use and is currently a joiner\u0026rsquos workshop.\nJohn Ker was also the last \u0026ldquoBoxmaster (minute secretary) of the Peebles Incorporation of Hammermen\u0026mdashthe blacksmiths\u0026rsquo once exclusive and powerful guild.\nIt fell to him to record in the minutes, rather regretfully, \u0026ldquoThere was no meeting and no dinner held in 1927\u0026mdashfitting, his forebear had been one of the founding signatories we believe. Times had changed, the calling had lost its prosperous and confident ambience, and that was a fact.\nThese events resonate with the story of Black Beauty\u0026rsquos life over a hundred years ago in Victorian England.\nSome of his memories were happy and some were very sad, none less so than those when he meets his old friend Ginger . . .\n"},{"url":null,"title":"40 week one-way system introduced in Jedburgh","story":"A TEMPORARY one-way system has been in introduced in Jedburgh to allow work to be carried out to a privately-owned dangerous building.\nThe new arrangement, which began on Monday (June 4), has seen a section of the High Street become one-way southbound from Jewellers Wynd to Canongate southbound, and a section of Exchange Street one-way northbound from High Street to Friarsgate.\nThis one-way system is required to extend scaffolding onto the road to allow for repairs to be carried out to the building, which has significant structural issues and needs extensive work to make it safe.\nThe disruption is expected to last 40 weeks, and a temporary walkway has also been introduced around the scaffolding to allow pedestrians to still use High Street and Exchange Street.\nSignage is in place to make people aware of the temporary arrangement.\nA joint statement by Jedburgh and District councillors Jim Brown, Scott Hamilton, Sandy Scott said: \u0026ldquoThe High Street dangerous building is a complex and long running issue, but the council is making progress and needs to introduce this temporary one-way system to carry out further repairs.\n\u0026ldquoThe council is looking at various options for the future of the building, and a report is expected to be discussed later this year.\n\u0026ldquoWe thank townsfolk for their patience so far, and would ask they comply with the temporary one-way system.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Borders parking issues working group calls for evidence from public","story":"A CALL for evidence on parking issues in Borders town centres has been issued by Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos Parking Issues Working Group.\nThe working group is currently gathering evidence and researching what happens in other local authority areas and will report back to the Executive Committee later this year with recommendations.\nAn online survey has now been launched to give local people and businesses the opportunity to provide evidence of any issues faced in their communities.\nCouncillor Gordon Edgar, Executive Member for Roads and Infrastructure and chair of the working group, said: \u0026ldquoAs part of our evidence gathering we want to hear from people on specific places, days and times when parking is a problem.

Charlotte Bliss, from Eastbourne, said: \"The cooked cheese items also amounted to no more than three stalls with huge queues.\u0026nbsp  \"I am appalled that this was allowed to be called a cheese festival.\u0026nbsp  \"I also purchased another ticket at the gate.  \"I will never attend another event like this in Brighton.\"  In an email to the event\u0027s organisers seen by The Argus, another guest, Flora Adam, said: \"I attended the event this afternoon and am extremely disappointed.  \"The event was in no way as advertised and had very little stands compared to what was promised.  \"Only a few hot foot stands (far from the 30-35 advertised) with no raclette cheese or fondue as detailed in your numerous Facebook promotions.  \"Stands were unprepared for the event and after queuing for 45 minutes we were told that halloumi fries were unavailable at about 2.30pm.  \"The gouda stand was running out of cheese as we left at 3pm.  \"Again, nothing as advertised and well overpriced at \u0026pound44 for two people.  \"I believe trading standards in this instance haven\u0027t been met and request a full refund.\"  Facebook groups have even been set up criticising the event, including one titled The Big Cheese Festival was a Load of Rubbish.  Organisers posted the following message on Facebook: \"Firstly, we would like to thank the thousands who attended The Big Cheese Festival today and who congaed their way around the Main Stage Tent, creating that incredible Festival Atmosphere.  \"We would like to express our sympathy toward some of our amazing cheese and cheesey Street Food Traders who were traveling to the city from across the country, and who due to adverse weather conditions and impassable roads, were unfortunately forced to abort their journeys today.  \"Sadly due to this, a few compromises had to be made and we are disappointed that a larger variety of cheese wasn\u0026rsquot available.  \"Despite this, our cheese traders who were able to attend showed amazing dedication throughout the event, and did not fail to deliver, with food available right to the end.  \"We would like to offer everyone who purchased a ticket 50 per cent discount to next years event.  \"All feedback will be taken on board, please email info@thebigcheesefestival.\"  Did you attend the festival?

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE. SILENT. CHILD. HAS. WON. AN. OSCAR.    I genuinely don\u0026rsquot know what to do now. #Oscar2018 pic.twitter/lfXWlFBCj9  The Silent Child beat four contenders to the award: DeKalb Elementary, The Eleven O\u0026rsquoClock,\u0026nbspMy Nephew Emmett and Watu Wote/All of Us.  The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message. Let people know what you\u0026rsquove seen and the emotions you\u0026rsquove felt.      \"Millions of children all over the world live in silence.\"    \u0027The Silent Child\u0027 screenwriter and star Rachel Shenton signed her #Oscars acceptance speech for Best Live Action Short Film. https://t.co/t3Dtf4Uy3c pic.twitter/PYB0M7gRNs"},{"url":null,"title":"IN PICS  East Lothian in the sun","story":"              THE sunshine has inspired East Lothian Courier Camera Club members to capture some stunning images this month.

Rockers Altered Sky are fulfilling their ambition of playing at Download Festival, Britain\u0026rsquos premier hard rock and heavy metal festival, on Thursday, June 7, with plans for a UK summer tour also set to be announced in the coming weeks.  The band, which includes Haddington\u0026rsquos Ana Nowosielska and Amy Blair, will be the main support in the Doghouse Tent, with the gig taking place the day before the main festival gets under way.  Ana, the band\u0026rsquos lead singer, was excited \u0026ldquobeyond words ahead of the festival, which is celebrating its 16th year.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt is up there with a childhood dream.  \u0026ldquoYou would go to Download and see Slipknot and Metallica and we are going to be playing there as well.  \u0026ldquoIt is absolutely amazing.  The band is looking at hiring a van and staying for the four-day festival at Donington Park, which this year is headlined by Avenged Sevenfold, Guns N\u0026rsquo Roses and Ozzy Osbourne.  Ana added: \u0026ldquoDownload is definitely one of our goals.  \u0026ldquoIt is one of the biggest music festivals in the UK, especially for our type of music.  \u0026ldquoIt is very much suited to where we want to be.  Currently the band\u0026rsquos attention is focused on creating their second album, the follow-up to Without Wonderland.  The five-piece will soon head down to Wales to record the album, with a view to it being released in the New Year.  Ana, 28, said: \u0026ldquoEverything has been a lot easier this time.  \u0026ldquoWe were joking the other day and saying we had a good five years to write the first album and now we have had six months to write the second album.  \u0026ldquoThe difference is we are definitely going to see that the album is going to stand by itself.  The band are then hoping to get back on the open road, with a UK tour being organised and the band keen to venture further afield again.  Last autumn, the band enjoyed a 19-date tour which saw them performing in the Philippines and Japan.  Ana told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are obviously talking about going back to Asia again. We met so many good people and made so many wonderful relationships.  \u0026ldquoWe would like to tour Europe \u0026ndash hit up Germany and we had an Italian tour in the works a year ago which fell through.  \u0026ldquoThen, of course, we would like to get over to the USA.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe reporter will ensure that the local development plan and the community\u0026rsquos views are taken into account prior to making a recommendation to ministers, who will make the final decision."},{"url":null,"title":"LOOKING BACK  Remembering the first ever Haddington Festival","story":"              HADDINGTON Festival is celebrating its golden anniversary at the moment, with the event having put a smile on thousands of faces since 1968.

She said: \u0026ldquoWe are looking forward to it because it is 50 years.  \u0026ldquoI remember being at the second one and have lots of good memories and just had a lot of fun over the years.  \u0026ldquoIt is not easy pulling a programme together but, once the programme is set, you meet so many different people and it is really good.  \u0026ldquoWe have had some laughs along the way.  More than a few famous faces have visited the Haddington Festival over the last five decades.  Actress Prunella Scales \u0026ndash who starred in Fawlty Towers and After Henry \u0026ndash musicians Johnny Dankworth and Dame Cleo Laine, The Proclaimers and Eddi Reader have all been involved down the years.  The Haddingtonshire Courier was there for the very first festival, which featured another famous musician, and looked ahead to it on May 17, 1968:  \u0026ldquoHaddington\u0026rsquos first ever Festival Week, which begins in just over two weeks\u0026rsquo time, has already caused considerable interest both inside and outside the burgh, and it looks as though it is going to be a resounding success.  \u0026ldquoWith a variety of events, ranging from a concert headed by Jimmy Shand and his band to several exhibitions, the week should appeal to a large section of the public.  \u0026ldquoThe festivities start on Sunday June 2 with a Drumhead Service on the East Haugh conducted by ministers of all denominations.  \u0026ldquoThat evening the opening variety show, featuring Jimmy Shand, his son, as well as Peter Mallan and several other well-known artistes will take place.  \u0026ldquoThroughout the week other events will include barbecues and folk singing evenings, a symposium on Haddington, organised by the St Andrew Society, productions by both the Haddington Operatic and Dramatic Societies, several dances, appealing both to young and old, a gymkhana, five-a-side football tournament and many other interesting and novel ventures.  \u0026ldquoAt present plans are being made for all public houses in the town to be open until 11pm each evening.  \u0026ldquoIf the weather is \u0026lsquokind\u0026rsquo, Haddington\u0026rsquos first Festival Week should prove to be both entertaining and successful."},{"url":null,"title":"IN PICTURES  Cockenzie and Port Seton Gala 2018","story":"              IT WAS a brilliant gala day in Cockenzie and Port Seton today.

Kenyan Joel Kipkemboi Kiptoo set a new course record, finishing in 2 hours, 13 minutes and 33 seconds. He smashed the previous record by almost two minutes, which was set by fellow Kenyan Zachary Kihara back in 2005.  Afterwards, Kiptoo said: \u0026ldquoIt was really nice for me, the course was flat and good. I just ran how I felt as I was alone most of the time. Of course I would love to come back and defend my title next year.\"  Organisers of the festival this year teamed up with Project Africa to bring athletes who might not normally have the chance to take part in the event to Scotland.  The women\u0026rsquos race was dominated by Project Africa athlete Caroline Jepchirchir, who led from the front with a time of 2 hours, 47 minutes and 35 seconds.  This year the marathon took on a new route through Edinburgh city centre before heading out to East Lothian, then finishing at its normal place in Musselburgh.  Scottish-born Outlander star Sam Heughan completed the marathon as part of a double challenge to raise funds for Cahonas Scotland.  Sam said: \u0026ldquoMy second marathon within a month and another personal best. Thanks so much to the organisers and the volunteers for making this such a great experience to run.\"  Neil Kilgour, Edinburgh Marathon festival director, said: \"2018 has been another incredible year for the Edinburgh Marathon Festival with outstanding performances, tens of thousands of participants and millions raised for good causes.  \u0026ldquoWe are so proud to host a truly world-class running event in Scotland\u0026rsquos Capital for runners of all ages from across the globe.

Cockenzie sculptor Gardner Molloy worked with Tranent and Elphinstone Community Council to design the work, which was commissioned by Fa\u0026rsquoside Area Parternship.  The first of the sculptures has been placed across from the Church Street roundabout and is made up of six pieces paying tribute to the historic Waggonway.  Carved into the blocks are images of people carrying coal to the wagons, which were led by horses and took the fuel from the pit at Tranent to Cockenzie Harbour.  The second sculpture has been placed at the rear of Caponhall Court.  It has been designed to celebrate the industry which built the town, with a farmer and coal miner both carved out of stone.  Standing two metres high, the coal miner is depicted at the bottom, with the farmer gathering his crop above it.  On the side of the sculpture on the Elphinstone side of the road is carved the word \u0026lsquoTranent\u0026rsquo.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7864264.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"SEPA water quality report  how clean is the water at your beach ","story":"              A MUSSELBURGH beach has been branded \u0026lsquopoor\u0026rsquo for its water quality in a report by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.

Between April 1 last year and the end of March 2018, 2,006 three-day emergency food supplies were given to local people.  Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.  In 2017-2018 benefit changes/delays accounted for 757 East Lothian cases with 1,666 people affected, including 617 children. In addition, 595 cases were referred for emergency food due to being refused a crisis grant, affecting 937 people, of which 253 were under the age of 16.  A total of 31,604 kilos of food was given out last year by the county\u0026rsquos foodbank, with 50,292kgs donated.

East Lothian MSP Iain Gray condemned the figures, saying: \u0026ldquoThese shocking figures underline the fact that problems with changes to the benefits system have made a significant contribution to the rise in foodbank referrals.  \u0026ldquoGovernments at Holyrood and Westminster can no longer sit back and accept the ever increasing number of people being forced to use foodbanks.

The first housebuilder is expected to be announced this summer, with work on housing getting under way potentially by the end of the year.  In the meantime, preparatory work has been carried out on the site, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie and Port Seton.  Now Hargreaves, which is behind the proposals, is looking to create an access to the site off the roundabout to the north of the A1 at Bankton Junction.

Other works are planned for the junction, which links the A1 with the A198.  Mr Slater said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the permission the road layout will be altered to allow for the additional cars generated from the Blindwells development.  \u0026ldquoThese works include widening of the A198 approaching the roundabout to increase capacity [as well as] the installation of a filter lane to allow cars leaving the A1 heading east to go round to Tranent without stopping at the roundabout. There are also plans for traffic lights to assist with traffic flows should the need arise.  As many as 350 jobs could be created during the lengthy building period at the site.  Construction work on the 1,600 homes could take 12-15 years, with early plans already drawn up for a second phase further to the east which could see another 1,600 homes, as well as leisure space and a cemetery."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7870497.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Tranent singer Caitlyn Vanbeck  39 s first single takes charts by storm","story":"              TRANENT singer Caitlyn Vanbeck\u0026rsquos first single flew up the charts when it was released on Monday.

Musselburgh\u0026rsquos Iceland store is back open after being closed for the refurbishment project.  The premises at Olive Bank Retail Park has a completely new layout and design, including the installation of new fascia and frontage, digital signage, LED lighting, improved in-store navigation and new checkouts that are quicker and easier to use.  The alcohol side of the business was discussed at a recent meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board in Haddington.  An increase in the display of alcohol of 8.8 square metres was proposed and given the green light by the committee\u0026rsquos councillors.  A detailed statement was provided to the committee which outlined the revamp both inside and outside the shop.  It read: \u0026ldquoThe result will be a modern, bright, accessible and customer-friendly store with a focus on quality. This will transcend all ranges and lines including alcohol.  \u0026ldquoWhilst alcohol is very much ancillary to the overall offer, there is a desire to incorporate premium wines and craft beers.  In a bid to prevent items being stolen, members heard how various measures were being taken to cut down on the chances of theft.  New CCTV has been installed throughout the store, while various bottles of alcohol are only accessed through a member of staff opening a locked cabinet.  Similarly, a number of \u0026ldquohigh value lines, including alcohol and various cuts of meat, are on \u0026ldquosmart shelves which sense when an item is lifted and alerts a member of staff through a pager.

John Muir Park has regularly been used by teenagers who are celebrating the end of their exams.

Police have patrolled the area after concerns at public meetings regarding underage drinking and the flouting of local bylaws involving drinking in a public place.  On Friday and Saturday, police and community wardens seized the alcohol from youngsters aged 14 to 21, with a variety of lager, cider and spirits, including 12 litres of vodka, taken.  Inspector Andrew Harborow said: \u0026ldquoEvery year around this time we are aware of youths congregating at Bullet Hill. Whilst this started out as an end-of-school celebration involving those mainly in S6, the ages of those taking part has clearly widened.  \u0026ldquoIn order to reduce the risk to those involved, we have taken action over the weekend and seized alcohol to prevent harm being caused and will be making follow-up enquiries with parents, carers and local shops as to where the alcohol came from.

The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.

Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7396901.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Youngsters    taste of the working world at course","story":"              MUSSELBURGH Racecourse welcomed pupils seeking a career in hospitality and tourism behind the scenes as part of the racing industry\u0026rsquos community day.

In unguarded comments at a private dinner, the Foreign Secretary said there was a risk Brexit \u0026ldquowill not be the one we want and would keep the UK \u0026ldquolocked in orbit around the EU.  At the gathering of the Conservative Way Forward, a Thatcherite campaign group, he branded the Treasury the \u0026ldquoheart of Remain and claimed negotiations were approaching a \u0026ldquomoment of truth.  In comments captured in a recording obtained by BuzzFeed News, he said the Prime Minister was \u0026ldquogoing to go into a phase where we are much more combative with Brussels.  He added: \u0026ldquoYou\u0026rsquove got to face the fact there may now be a meltdown. OK? I don\u0026rsquot want anybody to panic during the meltdown. No panic. Pro bono publico, no bloody panic. It\u0026rsquos going to be alright in the end.  Mr Johnson suggested Chancellor Philip Hammond\u0026rsquos department was \u0026ldquobasically the heart of Remain and said the UK could end up \u0026ldquoin the customs union and to a large extent still in the single market.  The Cabinet minister was speaking to around 20 people dining in a private room after a reception at the Institute of Directors on Wednesday night.  He said: \u0026ldquoUnless you make the change, unless you have the guts to go for the independent policy, you\u0026rsquore never going to get the economic benefits of Brexit. You\u0026rsquoll never get the political benefits of Brexit.  Mr Johnson said\u0026nbspfears about the border on the island of Ireland were out of proportion.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos so small and there are so few firms that actually use that border regularly, it\u0026rsquos just beyond belief that we\u0026rsquore allowing the tail to wag the dog in this way, he added.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore allowing the whole of our agenda to be dictated by this folly.  Mr Johnson also suggested Donald Trump would \u0026ldquogo in bloody hard and \u0026ldquomight get somewhere in the exit talks if he was in charge.  The US president, meanwhile, has grown tired of Mrs May\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoschool mistress tone, his allies have told the Daily .  His comments are the latest Brexit headache for the Prime Minister, who is in Canada for the G7 summit.  The Foreign Secretary\u0026rsquos deputy, Sir Alan Duncan, raised eyebrows in Westminster when he floated the possibility of a referendum on the exit deal.  Mrs May also met twice with David Davis before flying out to the summit amid reports the Brexit Secretary was considering resigning unless she set a clear time limit on the temporary customs arrangement.  Friends of Mr Johnson said: \u0026ldquoThis was a private dinner under Chatham House rules so it is sad and very disappointing that it has been covertly recorded and distributed to the media.  Michel Barnier, the EU\u0026rsquos chief Brexit negotiator, is expected to hold a press conference in Brussels at around 1pm to discuss the latest round of technical talks on the exit process.  Mrs May secured approval from senior ministers for a \u0026ldquobackstop arrangement that could keep the UK in a customs union with the EU beyond the end of 2020.  But there was no fixed deadline in the document published later, which said only the UK \u0026ldquoexpects a final customs solution to be in place by the end of December 2021 at the latest.  The document represents the UK\u0026rsquos counter to an EU proposal to keep Northern Ireland alone in the customs union after Brexit, which was rejected outright by Mrs May because it would draw a border down the Irish Sea.  In a letter to Tory MPs, obtained by The Times, the Prime Minister described the UK proposal as \u0026ldquounpalatable but at worst temporary and \u0026ldquoin no way the Government\u0026rsquos intended or desired result.  Under the new backstop proposals, if no agreement on customs has been implemented by the end of 2020, a temporary arrangement would ensure that no \u0026ldquotariffs, quotas, rules of origin (or) customs processes applied to UK-EU trade.  At the same time the UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries.  Mrs May braced herself for possible defeat in the Commons next week on an amendment which would require her to try to negotiate a permanent customs union with the remaining EU.  The PM has rejected most of the amendments made to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill made by peers, accepting only one in full.  Anti-Brexit campaign group Best for Britain has released an open letter to voters calling on them to join the \u0026ldquonational conversation aimed at resolving the \u0026ldquonightmare of Brexit.

Andrew Yorkston parked his vehicle in a lay-by near to Drummohr Holiday Park and left the two youngsters in the back seat of the locked car for about 30 minutes on a hot summer\u0027s day.  The six-year-old girl and two-year-old boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl banging on the car windows and screaming: \u0026ldquoHelp, save us.  The worried passers-by contacted the police and waited by the car to calm the kids before Yorkston eventually appeared, claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been [away] five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 27-year-old then drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  On Tuesday, Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard that Yorkston was in charge of the children when he was taking them to a nearby McDonald\u0027s and stopped off unexpectedly at the lay-by near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane told the court that the two-year-old boy and the six-year-old girl were spotted locked in the car at about 5.30pm.  Mr Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who were very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe six-year-old was shouting: \u0026lsquoHelp, save us.\u0026rsquo  The girl pointed to an opening in the trees and told the passers-by that the man looking after her was down there, the court heard.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, said that Yorkston, of North Grange Avenue, had stopped for a toilet break and his wife had been left \u0026ldquosuitably unimpressed by his actions.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  The solicitor added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0027s and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme.  \u0026ldquoFortunately there was no harm down to the children.  Sheriff Adrian Cottam deferred sentence to next month.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7806713.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"WHO admits mistaking Prestonpans for Preston on official pollution figures","story":"              THE World Health Organisation (WHO) has removed Prestonpans from its list of most polluted communities. . . after confirming that it had confused the East Lothian town with the English city of Preston!  There was widespread concern when the global monitor named Prestonpans as Scotland\u0026rsquos most polluted town in its latest breakdown of pollution figures earlier this month.  The annual list used readings taken from 2013 and named Prestonpans as the worst offender in Scotland.  WHO released a similar report two years ago which also named and shamed Prestonpans \u0026ndash yet it was thought then that the reported high pollution levels in the town related to the former Cockenzie Power Station, which had been operational until March 2013.  However, East Lothian Council told the Courier earlier this month that it believed the reading was actually down to a geographical error by WHO, claiming that the organisation had confused Prestonpans with Preston in Lancashire, nearly 200 miles away.  And this week, the WHO confirmed that this was indeed the case.  In an email to senior environmental health officials at the local authority, representatives of WHO confirmed that they had confused the two communities due to a computer mapping error.  They said: \u0026ldquoIt is true that there was a mislabel in the datum for Prestonpans, which should have been labelled as Preston.  \u0026ldquoThis error originated in the previous database release when reverse geocoding the coordinates from the EEA (European Economic Area).

Here we celebrate with 12 facts that will have you feeling supersonic while sipping that gin and tonic.  1) Scotland\u0027s love affair with gin dates from the 1700s  The Port of Leith in Edinburgh can lay claim to helping introduce Scots to the delights of gin.  A strong history of trading with the Netherlands saw vast quantities of jenever (Dutch for juniper) and exotic spices exchanged for Scottish produce such as wool. By 1777, there was eight licensed gin stills in Edinburgh \u0026ndash and reputedly almost 400 more unregistered.  2) We make 70% of gin consumed in the UK  The nation\u0027s love for gin shows few signs of waning. Over the past decade, the gin-making industry has mushroomed in Scotland with a raft of distilleries and craft gin brands.  Two of world\u0027s bestselling gins \u0026ndash Hendrick\u0027s and Tanqueray \u0026ndash are made in Girvan, Ayrshire and Leven, Fife, respectively. Then there\u0027s rising stars such as Speyside\u0027s Caorunn, The Botanist on Islay, Isle of Harris Gin and Arbikie Distillery in Angus.  Visit hendricksgin tanqueray caorunngin thebotanist harrisdistillery and arbikie  3) The definition of gin is rather fuzzy  4) The ingredients are innovative and colourful  The Botanist, a small-batch, artisanal gin, contains 31 botanicals of which 22 are hand-foraged on Islay including apple mint, chamomile, mugwort, thistle, gorse, hawthorn, elder, heather and bog myrtle.  Kintyre Gin uses 12 botanicals such as locally grown sheep sorrel and Icelandic moss, both unique to the brand, as well as citrus fruits, liquorice and angelica root.  Angus-based Gin Bothy came about after owner Kim Cameron was mulling over what to do with her leftover raspberry juice from making jam. Cameron uses a 17th-century recipe once popular among bothy dwellers who would sweeten alcohol using fruits, tree sap or herbs.  The annual gin production calendar starts with raspberry and blueberry, then moves into rhubarb, chilli (made from Fife grown capsicums) and Amaretto. The brand has unveiled a limited-edition Sloe Gin this week to mark World Gin Day.

Visit kintyregin ginbothy and stirlinggin  5) Juniper is not a berry  It\u0027s actually a seed cone. Juniper is still picked wild across Europe, rather than mass produced, and then sold via distributors to gin makers worldwide.  It is said to have medicinal properties such as helping alleviate digestive problems including upset stomach, flatulence, heartburn and bloating as well as being used to treat urinary tract infections, kidney and bladder stones \u0026ndash and even snake bites.  Between the 14th and 17th centuries, plague doctors reputedly wore masks filled with juniper and other berries which they believed helped stop the spread of the disease.  6) There are gin distilleries popping up across Scotland  Kinrara is one of the new kids on the block. The distillery \u0026ndash within a 12,000-acre estate in the Cairngorm National Park near Aviemore \u0026ndash launched in January. New off the stills is Kinrara Highland Dry Gin and an Estate Edition Hibiscus Gin.  Colonsay Gin has used the Strathearn Distillery near Methven in Perthshire for its small-batch production since last year and\u0026nbspis about to open premises on the Hebridean island whose name it bears. The first \"island batch\" of Colonsay Gin is set to run from the still this month.  Having grown from modest beginnings as a kitchen table project for wife-and-husband lawyer duo Vivienne and Steve Muir in 2013, NB Gin unveiled a distillery and visitor centre near Tantallon Castle in East Lothian in April. Tours cost \u0026pound30pp.  Visit kinraradistillery wildthymespirits and nbdistillery  7) Gin-making comes in all shapes and sizes  Glasgow can lay claim to one of smallest commercial gin producers in the UK \u0026ndash possibly the world \u0026ndash with McLean\u0027s Gin which is made in the cupboard of a tenement flat.  It all came about after Colin McLean was given a make-your-own-gin kit for Christmas by his in-laws and decided to rustle some up a Valentine\u0027s Day tipple for his wife Jess. That went down a treat and so began many months of research and experimentation.  McLean\u0027s Gin launched last September releasing five varieties: signature, floral, citrus, spiced and cherry bakewell (which has become their bestseller).  Colin works as a sales and technical manager for a construction firm, while Jess is a junior doctor. To date they\u0027ve sold 1,600 bottles\u0026nbspincluding a limited-edition called Something Blue, released to commemorate their recent wedding, which sold out within five days.  READ MORE:\u0026nbsp15 things to do in Scotland when the sun shines  McLean\u0027s Gin has around 20 stockists from as far north as Arbroath all the way down to Weymouth in the south-west of England. Not bad going for a business that began life in a 1.5 square metre cupboard.  Visit facebook/mcleansgin  8) Gin production is breathing life into old buildings  Pickering\u0027s Gin is produced at its Summerhall Distillery in an old animal hospital at the erstwhile site of the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies in Edinburgh.  Beinn an Tuirc Distillery, which makes Kintyre Gin, is housed in a former\u0026nbsppiggery on the Torrisdale Castle Estate, while Persie Gin, founded and run by Simon Fairclough, uses a converted hotel at the foot of Glenshee in Perthshire.  Visit pickeringsgin and persiedistillery  9) The pot stills are lovingly named  Edinburgh Gin has pot stills called Flora and Caledonia at its Rutland Place distillery, while Misty Isle Gin on Skye has plumped for Christy, Mairi, Euan and Finlay with its test still for new recipes dubbed Wee Tommy, after co-founder and managing director Thomas Wilson.  The prize for best nickname, however, must go to The Botanist where the cherished Lomond pot-still is affectionately known as Ugly Betty.  Visit edinburghgin and isleofskyedistillers  10) There is something to suit most palates  The biggest misconception is that all gins taste the same. While juniper-forward, piney gins are perhaps what many people are familiar with, there is something to tickle most taste buds from fruity, sweet and floral to spicy, herbal and smoky.  New to gin or keen to gen up your knowledge? Book yourself a tasting with Gin Club Scotland run by Perthshire-based Chrissie Fairclough.  She provides staff training for shops, bars, hotels and restaurants as well as offering private tasting sessions with tips on everything from gin nosing to food parings.

Visit ginclubscotland  11) Be wary of clever marketing  This is where we wade into the quagmire. Not every gin bearing a Scottish name is made here: there are brands that use contract distillers in London and Birmingham. Be sure to read the small print.  12) Don\u0027t just stick to tonic water  Garnish with everything from rose petals to pink grapefruit and even chilli. In fact, we have a trio of cocktail recipes for you.

Fringe takes on problems it alone cannot solve  The ambitious Blueprint, launched by chief executive Shona McCarthy, lists a series of \"big ambitions\" for the festival, including making it more affordable for artists, a better connection to education, a look at the problem of accommodation in the festival period, increasing its inclusivity, as well finding a new HQ for the Fringe Society, which would be open \"year-round\".  In a section dedicated to keeping the Fringe affordable for artists, it says: \"The moment Edinburgh becomes too expensive for artists is the moment the Fringe ceases to function.\"  The Society, which runs the festival, is currently based in three buildings, including its well-known shop on the High Street, and Ms McCarthy said it is open to either a new building or utilising a new one for a new base in the capital.  Ms McCarthy said that many of the aspirations in the document is also a \"massive call out for help\" to other major bodies in the city, including the city council, to help deliver the changes.  It also pledges to ensure that artists can attend the Fringe permit-free after Brexit, and says it will freeze participation fees until at least 2022.  It promises to \"seek to increase the availability of affordable accommodation.\"  READ MORE: The end of cash in the hat?

This year will see a relaunch of the street events, which are sponsored by Virgin Money, on the High Street and Mound.  There will be on the Royal Mile, the festival said \"spectacular entrance archways\", new showcases on two major stages, and \"hundreds of brightly coloured pigeons\".  \"The street will look and feel different this year, not only in terms of the look, but in terms of our approach,\" Ms McCarthy said.  \"We are not bringing back Fringe Sunday, but there are elements of it, with every Sunday a 1\u0027o\u0027clock comedy showcase.  \"It will be the street performers, the buskers, but also more of a showcase for the wider Fringe as well - you will see the street itself as a venue.\"  The Blueprint says the festival will have a new expert panel of \"diverse advisors to support artists from black, minority ethnic, working class, disabled and LGBT backgrounds.\"  Ms McCarthy added: \"The Fringe Blueprint identifies new approaches to ensure anyone can participate, regardless of their background.  \"From driving down the cost of attendance to engaging young people in the arts and reaching out to underrepresented groups in Edinburgh and further afield, we want the Fringe to be the greatest festival on earth at which to perform, run a venue, develop a career, see shows and discover talent.\"  READ MORE: Blueprint for the future?

Kate Forbes MSP, who is a ministerial aide to Finance Secretary Derek Mackay, said the ongoing crisis around exiting the EU should be used as \u0026ldquoan opportunity to prepare.  But instead, it is \"far easier\" for politicians to simply blame Brexit and the UK Government, she said.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspScotland\u0026rsquos economy \u0027lags other small countries\u0027  Ms Forbes made the comments during an event by the think tank Reform Scotland, which was discussing a new report by economics advisor David Skilling.  Mr Skilling found Scotland\u0026rsquos economy has \u0026ldquolagged behind that of other advanced small nations, with a slowdown in the oil and gas sector hitting GDP growth and the UK acting as a \u0026ldquodrag on performance.

She told the event: \u0026ldquoThis is where you can tell I\u0026rsquom not currently acting as my party\u0026rsquos spokesperson.

Yesterday, Mr Mackay reiterated calls for Holyrood to take control of immigration powers in order to boost economic growth.  The Finance Secretary said the UK Government\u0027s target of reducing migration to the tens of thousands was \"unhelpful\" to Scotland, which has an ageing population.  In his report, Mr Skilling looked at the performance of countries including Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Hong Kong and Switzerland, where GDP per capita was measured at \u0026pound60,000 \u0026ndash more than double the Scottish figure.  He said there was \u0026ldquono single specific policy model for a successful small country, but insisted he was generally optimistic about their prospects in the global economy.  However, he argued the intensity of competition was increasing, while the \u0026ldquounusually supportive environment for small, open economies after the Second World War was becoming more challenging under the influence of Donald Trump and China.  Mr Skilling also warned an independent Scotland would need to \u0026ldquothink hard about issues such as income tax.  He said: \u0026ldquoYou need to think hard about the competitive impact in terms of how attractive Scotland is to firms and to people.  He added: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos no magic tax rate above which you\u0027re in trouble and below which you\u0026rsquore fine, but I do think it\u0026rsquos one of the elements that plays to competitiveness.  \u0026ldquoSo if you\u0026rsquore raising the tax rate \u0026ndash obviously it increases the cost structure, [and]\u0026nbspyou need to have a degree of confidence that you have other things going on that are going to make that feasible and sustainable.

The former Liberal leader accused Benjamin Netanyahu\u0027s Government of continuing to treat Palestinian lives \"as inferior to their own\".  Lord Steel of Aikwood, the former president of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, expressed hope that the recent \"slaughter\" during protests at the Gaza border would galvanise global opinion just as the Sharpeville Massacre had in South Africa.  The shooting dead by police of 69 unarmed people protesting against apartheid laws in 1960 was seen as a turning point in the nation\u0027s liberation struggle.  Lord Steel was also critical of the international community, including successive UK Governments, which, he argued, had allowed Israel \"to defy the United Nations and trample on the rights of Palestinians\".  The Liberal Democrat peer made his hard-hitting remarks as he opened a debate in the House of Lords on the situation in the Palestinian territories.  It followed a meeting between Theresa May and Mr Netanyahu, where she raised concerns over the recent deadly border clashes.  Lord Steel told peers: \"I don\u0027t know if the Israeli government knows or cares how low they have sunk in world esteem.\"  He said the conduct of the current administration was \"a clear betrayal\" of the basis on which the Lloyd George Government had welcomed a state of Israel in 1917.  He pointed out that in the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, many white activists were predominantly Jewish.  \"They knew where doctrines of racial superiority ultimately and tragically led,\" explained Lord Steel.  \"I rather hope that the recent slaughter in Gaza may awaken the international conscience to resolute action in the same way that the Sharpeville massacre led to the ultimately successful campaign by anti-apartheid forces worldwide.\"  Drawing parallels with the apartheid system of segregation, the peer went on: \"On my visits to that beautiful and successful country one cannot help noticing not just the wall but the roads in the West Bank usable by Israelis only.  \"Just as facilities in the old South Africa were reserved for whites only.\"  Urging the PM to be \"forceful, honest and frank\" with Mr Netanyahu, the former Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament accused her of a \"continuing limp response\".  He said: \"We cannot allow the Israeli government to treat Palestinian lives as inferior to their own which is what they consistently do.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0027s why our government should not only support the two-state solution but register our determination and disapproval of their conduct by accepting the decisions of both houses of our Parliament and recognise the state of Palestine without further delay.\"  Fellow Scot Michael Ancram, who sits as the Marquess of Lothian, described himself as a friend of Israel, but added: \"We owe our friends our honesty. Over the years, I have often praised Israel and the Israeli people, for whom I have great admiration. But Israeli actions against the Palestinians, which are legally and morally wrong, should be condemned.  \"It cannot be morally or legally right to lay claim to parts of someone else\u0027s territory by building settlements on it or by building a wall across it, which effectively creates a new territorial border.\"  The former Conservative Party chairman added: \"Equally, I condemn unprovoked acts of violence by those who oppose Israel, but many of them cannot be in the same category of friendship as Israel is to us. Democratic Israel should know better than what it is doing at the moment.\"  Lord Hannay of Chiswick, the former diplomat and independent crossbencher, said the UK should recognise the state of Palestine and likened current US diplomacy in the region to resembling \"the activities of a child with a box of matches wandering around in a storeroom full of cans of petrol\".  Lord Warner, the former Labour minister, now also an independent crossbencher, accused the Israeli military in countering recent demonstrations of behaving \"like people auditioning for a Sam Peckinpah film,\" adding: \"This isn\u0027t Israel defending its homeland. It was an international atrocity that needs to be investigated by the UN.\"  Baroness Tonge, a non-affiliated peer, accused the UK Government of standing by \"feebly\" while \"slaughter and dispossession continues\" for the Palestinians.  She said ministers were \"bleating about a two-state solution\" while refusing to recognise the state of Palestine.  Lord Collins of Highbury, the Opposition spokesman, said Gaza had endured a \"spiral of violence\", which has \"created a toxic cocktail of hopelessness and desperation\".  He insisted a two-state solution was the only way forward and said it was Labour policy if elected to recognise the state of Palestine immediately.  \"I wish that the Israeli government would do the same. It would go a long way towards building a two-state solution in the region.\"  Lord Collins pressed the UK Government over why it did not recognise Palestine now and when it would do so.  Responding for the Government, Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon, the Foreign Office Minister, said: \"The UK and the Government is committed and remains committed to supporting a negotiated peace settlement, which does lead to that viable sovereign and stable Palestinian state living alongside a safe, secure, prosperous and progressive Israel.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Independent review ordered into policing during the 1980s miners  strike","story":"              CAMPAIGNERS have hailed a \u0026ldquohuge breakthrough in the fight for justice after it was announced an independent review will be carried out into the impact of policing during the miners\u0026rsquo strike of the 1980s.  Almost 500 Scottish miners were convicted during the 1984-85 dispute, which saw brutal clashes between officers and picketing workers.  Justice Secretary Michael Matheson insisted Scotland would now lead the way in ensuring questions are finally answered, adding: \"Some of our communities have been blighted by the shadow of that time for too long.\"  READ MORE:\u0026nbspCalls for Hillsborough-style inquiry into the miners\u0026rsquo strike \u0027ignored\u0027  The move was met with celebrations from those who were caught up in the unrest more than 30 years ago, and who have long campaigned for their voices to be heard.  Bob Young, 74, from Dunfermline, was arrested seven times when he was chairman of the pit at Comrie in Fife, before being sacked after ending up in court.  A miner from the age of 14, he alleges he was specifically targeted and harassed by police, and eventually hopes for a full, Hillsborough-style inquiry.  He said: \u0026ldquoFor 30-odd years we\u0026rsquove been fighting and fighting and fighting, and trying to get some sort of inquiry \u0026ndash it didn\u0026rsquot matter at what level. And this is probably one of the best days of my life.  \u0026ldquoThe things that happened during the strike, with the policing, were totally out of order. We just wanted our voices to be heard, and instead we\u0026rsquove been shouted down by successive governments.  \u0026ldquoAt the end of the day, I hope there\u0026rsquos clarity on exactly what happened to us. The strike was hard enough, but see being sacked? That was much harder.  Mr Matheson called on the UK Government \u0026ndash which has already ruled out an inquiry into the violent confrontations between police and striking miners in Orgreave, South Yorkshire, in 1984 \u0026ndash to follow suit.  He said it had an obligation to \"fully explore the extent of any political interference\" by the then government, under Margaret Thatcher.

Scottish Labour MSP Neil Findlay, who has long campaigned for an inquiry into the miners\u0026rsquo strike after seeing the impact first-hand as a teenager during the 1980s, hailed the move as a \u0026ldquohuge step forward in the fight for justice.  He said: \u0026ldquoScottish miners suffered disproportionately from the impact \u0026ndash with just 10 per cent of the overall UK mining workforce Scotland saw 30 per cent of the sackings following arrest.  \u0026ldquoMany of these workers lost not just their jobs and income, but their relationships, their homes and many their mental and physical health.  \u0026ldquoSome were blacklisted and others went to their graves the victims of a miscarriage of justice with a criminal conviction against their name when the reality was they had done nothing wrong.  UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also welcomed the review, insisting it must establish if the arrests and convictions were \u0026ldquounjust and politically motivated.\"  He added: \"The UK Government must now listen to campaigners and launch an independent inquiry into the brutal clashes between police and miners during the strike in 1984, not least at Orgreave, where so many questions still need to be answered.\"  Mr Matheson said there were \"constraints\" around the kind of review the Scottish Government could establish, but left the door open to a full inquiry if necessary.  He said the review team will also include former independent MSP Dennis Canavan, former police assistant chief constable Kate Thomson and Jim Murdoch, professor of public law at Glasgow University.  The miners\u0027 strike, which lasted from March 1984 to March 1985, took place after Mrs Thatcher announced plans to close a number of pits which were deemed \"inefficient\".

For years, Ms Robison - sorry, Shona - has, through no fault of her own, been trapped behind a desk with the words Health Secretary written on it.  No one is quite sure how she got there, but everyone knows she needs to leave.  You can see it in her eyes. \u0026lsquoHelp me,\u0026rsquo they plead each Thursday, \u0026lsquomake it stop.\u0026rsquo  It is one of the worst cases of seat blocking Holyrood has ever known.

Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie tried to intercede next, listing the terrible side-effects caused by Shona\u0026rsquos long years of tortured imprisonment.  Mental health waits up 60 per cent, consultant vacancies up 24 per cent, A\u0026ampE targets missed for 10 months in a row.  But Ms Sturgeon merely scoffed villainously and reeled off her own statistics.  \u0026ldquoYes, there are challenges in our health service, she purred. \u0026ldquoBut they are not unique to Scotland. We will continue to do the hard work. Shona winced.  \u0026ldquoSo, if we half close our eyes, things are fine, shot back Mr Rennie. \u0026ldquoIt is time for the First Minister to open her eyes.

But what is all the fuss about? No 10 repeatedly insists the back-stop will never have to be used.  But the very fact so much political angst and media attention has been spent on the contingency plan underlines how UK ministers\u0026rsquo tortuous deliberations on the NCP and max-fac are going absolutely nowhere the never-to-be-used back-stop might, actually, be where we all end up.  A key detail of the contingency plan is when, if enacted, would it end?  The Government has always said it would be time-limited ending when a new customs plan was finally agreed. But a draft composed by officials did not contain a set date.  David Davis hit the roof. The Brexit Secretary felt he was being strung along as without an end-date, the back-stop would be open-ended indefinite. Which would mean the customs union status quo, meant to end when the transition period closes in December 2020, would go on and on. Cue the Eagles music.  Such was the level of the Davis ire, it was put about he was on the brink of resignation.  Losing your Brexit Secretary at this stage of the game would be disastrous and would threaten Theresa May\u0026rsquos own position.  So the Prime Minister called in the three Brexiteers \u0026ndash Davis, Johnson and Fox \u0026ndash to calm them down.  A line was inserted into the back-stop plan: \u0026ldquoThe UK expects the future arrangement to be in place by the end of December 2021 at the latest.  In other words, a fudge. To \u0026ldquoexpect something does not mean it will happen.  So Mr Davis won a \u0026ldquovictory by getting a date in the text. However, in practical terms it is meaningless jiggery-pokery.  Just to point out: December 2021 is 33 months after Brexit Day and perilously close to the run-in to the next General Election in June 2022.  Plus, there is Brussels.

Best for Britain says: \u0026ldquoThe Government is hanging on in the negotiations by a thread.  \u0026ldquoAt such a time of crisis, other voices would usually speak out and help the country change course. A few brave politicians are doing this publicly. Meanwhile, the rest stay silent or peddle party lines...  \u0026ldquoAs the deadline for the final decision approaches, public opinion is shifting in favour of having their first real say on the facts of what Brexit will actually mean\u0026hellipWe must end the chaos of Brexit and focus minds on bridging the divide in our country and repairing our society.  Lord Malloch-Brown, the former Labour Foreign Office Minister, who chairs the campaign, described its launch document as an \u0026ldquooffer to the British people to solve the national uncertainty of Brexit via a democratic process, the path to which will be outlined in the campaign\u0026rsquos roadmap released on Friday.  The launch event will kick off a summer of campaigning by the group of more than 100 seats throughout the UK to try and swing the Brexit debate.  The drive will be led by 50,000 grassroots campaigners, who will urge MPs to back the plan and take the first steps towards a final say on the Brexit deal.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos time for us all to take a step back and seriously consider what is best for Britain and its people, declared Lord Malloch-Brown.  \u0026ldquoWe at Best for Britain are fighting the Government\u0026rsquos Brexit but this week we\u0026rsquore also calling for all sides to commit to ending uncertainty for our country once and for all. Our plan will help give the country closure on an issue that now dominates our entire political discourse and is stopping the country tackling its deep-seated problems.  Eloise Todd, the campaign\u0026rsquos Chief Executive, said: \u0026ldquoWe are launching a national conversation with the British public because the Government has not asked the people what they actually want. Whether you voted leave or remain, you did not vote for this.  \"Best for Britain have never hidden our views and we are being clear today we\u0026rsquoll keep putting the case for staying and building on our relationship with the EU. But what we\u0026rsquore calling for today is beyond our view on Brexit: it\u0026rsquos about getting clarity for people across this country so we can move on from Brexit together."},{"url":null,"title":"North Lanarkshire town hosts  AnyoneButEngland World Cup ad","story":"              ENGLAND has always been known as the Auld Enemy.

Looks like the good people of Wishy have nailed their #WorldCupRussia2018 colours to the mast #anyonebutEngland pic.twitter/PSvH4HvQAw  The poster features the logo for the Commercial pub in Wishaw - and some locals have even cheekily speculated it is a PR stunt to get extra custom.  It\u0027s not the first time Scots have taken a deliberate anti-England stance when it comes to big tournaments, with many complaining that \u0027the English cannot stop talking about that 1966 World Cup win\u0027.  The rivalry has historically also made it onto record.  Andy Cameron\u0027s Ally\u0027s Tartan Army World Cup song in 1978 contained the famous line: \"We\u0027re representing Britain we\u0027ve got to do or die, for England cannae dae it \u0027cause they didnae qualify.\"  England won their final World Cup warm up game, beating Costa Rica 2-0 in Leeds      #anyonebutengland Well played The Commercial Wishaw \u0026#128513\u0026#128077\u0026#127995 pic.twitter/U12zd6p8v6      It\u0027s the Commercial in Wishaw.
