Around me an army of eager, Lycra-clad men and women stand in neat rows, shoulder width apart, eyes widened. Ear-bleedingly loud dance music pumps through the speakers as Heidi and Chris Powell – the stars of US hit reality show Extreme Weight Loss – take the stage to lead an exercise class that will help us reach our ‘pain threshold’ and ‘burn optimum body fat’.Someone in the crowd screams. Another cries. It’s not yet 7.30am. Welcome to the first day of the world’s biggest fitness convention: Idea World, in San Diego, southern California.Dubbed the ‘superbowl of the fitness industry’, the annual event brings together more than 200 fitness industry professionals, trainers and celebrity weight-loss gurus, alongside 14,000 exercise fanatics from all around the globe.They flock to the four-day festival to find the latest innovations and trends in workouts, equipment and technology on offer. And what debuts here quickly makes its way into gyms across the Atlantic.Justin Webb: Why I\u0027ll stick with walking my labradoodle...I can cry and scream when I\u0027m running: TANA RAMSAY explains...Share this articleThe expo has launched countless products, machines and exercises during its 36-year run, from vibrating power plates to Zumba.As a long-time exercise-avoider with minimal muscle mass, I’ve always struggled to find an exercise class I enjoy. So, as the only British journalist invited to attend this year, would I discover one I could actually bear?COULD I GET MADONNA’S BOTTOM?The exhaustive list of almost 400 classes, workouts and evening activities at Idea World is overwhelming I commit to 25 classes over a period of 48 hours.Only the most sweat-inducing make my cut.After the Powells’ Extreme Transformation Workout, an endless series of muscle-toning exercises performed for three minutes at a time, I move on to a BOSU class: exercises practised aboard a squishy rubber dome.Instructor Alison demonstrates how to ‘paddle’ with my steel bar in hand, engaging the core and glutes for ‘bums and tums’ tightening.          Over the course of 48 hours, Eve tried out 20 different work outs at the Idea World fitness convention in San Diego, CaliforniaFinding my balance on the rubber sphere is tough enough let alone extending opposite arm and legs simultaneously. Remarkably, by focusing on a spot on the wall in front of me, I’m able to complete the rest of the routine with minimal wobbling.After Tae Bo, a mixture of martial arts and aerobics, comes Booty Barre – a class especially designed to build a beautiful bottom.The workout – whose fans include Madonna – draws on the principles of Pilates and ballet.As a regular Pilates goer, I was fairly confident I’d get through the hour with ease, but after five minutes of thrusting with a medicine ball between my legs – on tiptoes – I realise this isn’t the case.By the end of the class, my thighs are like jelly and I’m starving hungry. It’s 10am.BOOT CAMP, BOXING... AND BATTLE ROPESI decide to get the worst out the way before lunchtime: army boot camp.Developed by a former US sergeant, this is a 90-minute sweatathon involving jumping squats, lunges and sprints interspersed with military-style marches. Angry orders from Sergeant Ken Weichart (aka Sgt Ken) to ‘Embrace The Pain!’ keep me moving despite the agony but after 50 rapid squats and the sergeant’s demands to ‘get lower’, I succumb to the pain and embarrassingly stumble mid-rep. ‘No quitters here!’ Ken loudly reminds me.I manage a 30-minute lunch break before leaping straight into the on-site boxing ring for a couple of rounds with a bullish, bald-headed former champ.          This odd-looking device is supposed to provide a work out for bums and tumsTo my surprise, I can throw a mean punch and even manage a spin, kick and smack move.Then I move across to Battle Ropes. After 15 minutes of tutorial, we experiment with all 30 ways a 55 lb, 50ft rope can be moved about for a vigorous full-body workout.It’s not all about waving it with the hands – try jumping between two ropes for a quick warm-up, or lifting the ropes in between press-ups to work the core and arms. At the end of the class, I unashamedly collapse on the floor into a pool of my own sweat and admit defeat. Tomorrow is another day…TORTURE... FOR KILLER ABSOn day two, I explore the 500,000 square foot exhibition hall showcasing almost 400 cutting-edge fitness gadgets and machinery.I start with a demonstration of the latest vibrating Power Plate to hit US gyms. The machine stimulates muscles with vibration, increasing muscle tone when exercising. I expect to watch my love handles wiggle off my body without moving but unfortunately, some work is required. I try step-ups and single leg balances, before moving on to planks, bridges and seated crunches – all aboard the vibrating platform. Each exercise feels ten times more intense than I’d ever experienced before, with ripples of pain shooting through my entire body.Converts claim that those ten minutes of excruciating torture are the fastest route to killer abs.Other highlights of the exhibition include a 6ft stair-climbing machine which, on maximum resistance, feels five times harder than normal stairs a virtual-reality treadmill that sends me running through the French countryside and a cycling machine called Real Ryder which tilts 22 degrees and emits stimulating vibrations. I disembark the bike, feeling two stone lighter, and seek out an upper-body exercise to give my legs some well-earned rest.

But the way they efficiently dismantled, destroyed, and shamelessly discredited these women for speaking their truth.\u0027Bourdain, who had been dating Italian actress Asia Argento - one of Weinstein\u0027s first accusers, also spoke of Hillary\u0027s response to the wave of sexual assault allegations leveled against the Hollywood producer.Soon after the allegations started piling up about Weinstein, Hillary said she was \u0027appalled\u0027 and denied having any knowledge of what was happening behind closed doors.\u0027It was something that was just intolerable in every way,\u0027 Hillary said at the time. \u0027And, you know, like so many people who\u0027ve come forward and spoken out, this was a different side of a person who I and many others had known in the past.\u0027   Bourdain - one of the most outspoken male supporters of the #MeToo movement - touched on Bill Clinton\u0027s sexual misconduct allegations, slamming the former president and his wife Hillary for the way they \u0027destroyed\u0027 those womenWeinstein hosted events and donated personally to Clinton ever since she first ran for public office back in 1999 as a senator for the state of New York. Bourdain publicly slammed Hillary on Twitter calling her response \u0027shameful in its deflection and its disingenuousness\u0027. When asked about Clinton\u0027s response in his February interview, Bourdain said: \u0027I will tell you that as frightening as that was at times, when I sat there with Asia, as she texted her sisters… watching the Clinton apology on Weinstein, and (Asia\u0027s) watching this statement, there was a lot of anticipation. \u0027People were really hoping she\u0027d come out with a… I don\u0027t know. Let\u0027s just say with something different. I immediately tweeted my disappointment, very much shaped by what I saw around me. And I will tell you, that was really f**king frightening, the reaction to that. You know, I voted for her.Anthony Bourdain receives SIX Emmy nominations for his CNN...Share this article\u0027I was really disappointed with the statement. But even by expressing that (on Twitter), the way that my comment was turned, very neatly - suddenly I wasn\u0027t expressing disappointment in her statement I was blaming her for Harvey Weinstein\u0027s crimes. The way that turned very nicely was a good bit of artistry and deeply frightening to me.\u0027Specifically on Weinstein, Bourdain said while he would have liked to see the producer \u0027beaten to death in his cell\u0027, he had imagined something much different.\u0027My theory of how he goes is he\u0027s brushing his teeth in a bathroom, he\u0027s naked in his famous bathrobe, which is flapping open, he\u0027s holding his cell phone in one hand because you never know who on the Weinstein board has betrayed him recently, and he\u0027s brushing his teeth,\u0027 Bourdain said.          Specifically on Weinstein, Bourdain said while he would have liked to see the producer \u0027beaten to death in his cell\u0027, he had imagined him dying alone in his bathtub dressed in a robe          Bourdain, who had been dating Italian actress Asia Argento - one of Weinstein\u0027s first accusers, mentioned that he was sitting next to his girlfriend as they listened to Hillary Clinton respond to the allegations\u0027He suddenly gets a massive f**king stroke - he stumbles backwards into the bathtub, where he finds himself with his robe open feet sticking out of the tub, and in his last moments of consciousness as he scrolls through his contacts list trying to figure out who he can call, who will actually answer the phone.\u0027The interview also covered current politics in the Trump-era with Bourdain saying he would be filling to compromise his principles in exchange for some \u0027f**king competency\u0027 and for someone who has an understanding of how government works. \u0027It\u0027s like, that\u0027s okay, cause Jared will brief me later. Does Jared tweeze his eyebrows? They look manscaped. Those are not natural eyebrows. It\u0027s like Howdy Doody time,\u0027 Bourdain said. \u0027Can you see eight guys standing around, and Jared\u0027s out of the room? And they\u0027re all co-conspirators, they\u0027re all saying, \u0027ey don\u0027t worry bout Jared, he\u0027s f**kin\u0027 solid, the guy will stand up, he ain\u0027t gonna say nothin\u0027.\u0027No one has ever said that! That f**kin little punk is gonna squeal, just show him a tray of jail food, the guy will f**kin shit himself. That kid was a born snitch.\u0027 The lengthy interview with Bourdain was conducted months before he took his life in early June in eastern France where he was working on an episode of his show.Bourdain received several posthumous Emmy nominations last Thursday for his CNN series \u0027Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown\u0027."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/14/15/4E3B2A1F00000578-0-image-a-42_1531578826112.jpg","title":"Family stuck waist high mud Somerset beach","story":"    A family had to be rescued from the mud after they became stuck, waist-high on Saturday          The group were pulled from the mud near Weston-Super-Mare and brought back to shoreTwo hovercrafts took rescuers out to the scene and the family were pulled from the mud and taken back to safety.It was a busy day for the hovercraft crew, who later rescued another boy from the mud.A Burnham Area Rescue Boat (BARB) spokesman said of the first rescue: \u0027The group was given safety advice about the danger of the mud and checked over by paramedics before being released.Stranded family are dramatically rescued from rocks after...Will heatwave continue for ANOTHER 40 days and nights?...Share this article\u0027It was established that the group of four adults and a child were doing OK and had been enjoying a challenging walk and insisted they were in no difficulty.\u0027Although this was the case, the concerns are that they had been out in very harsh heat without any water and the exertion of walking through the mud can lead to dehydration.

I found it hilarious.\u0027          The chat began with Jon asking for a picture of \u0027the other side\u0027 of the flag from the Facebook sellerDuring the protracted negotiations, Jon asked the man \u0027how does it cope under windy conditions mate? Does it gracefully flutter or is it more of a wobble?\u0027 to which the seller replied \u0027gracefully\u0027.He even asked for the unnamed seller to take a picture of the other side of the flag - despite it being translucent.But the 26-year-old claimed it was only during the process of considering whether to buy the flag he realised it was damaged with a hole - and despite offering £1.83, this was rejected.          Jon insisted he wanted an image of the other side of the translucent flag from the person selling it over the internet           The seller obliged but refused to lie down next to the flag for a photo to give an idea of its size           The father-of-one prankster continued to make bizarre requests during the conversation, last Thursday          The seller said it was \u0027white and red\u0027 rather than \u0027red and white\u0027 when asked by Mr Pilkington          The hilarious conversation went on with the man finally revealing the flag has a hole in it - although he mis-typed it \u0027hoe\u0027          The seller who was clearly still fooled even took a picture of the hole to send to the potential buyer Jon, who is dad to a six-year-old boy, said he has been hit with social media trolling of his own with many online commentators criticizing his post.He said: \u0027Never in my life have I bullied anyone nor was I then - it\u0027s good to have some fun on social media, as long as it\u0027s in good taste.\u0027If people feel sorry for the guy, then from what I can see he\u0027s trying to sell loads of stuff.\u0027By all means drop him a message and help him out financially.\u0027If anyone would be interested to purchase the flag, then my research shows it\u0027s still available.\u0027However they should know from the start, there is a hole.\u0027This information was not made apparent to me until it was nearly too late.\u0027           The conversation ended when the seller refused to take £1.83 for the flag after the revelation it had a hole in it"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/16/10/4E4E2C0A00000578-5958205-image-a-2_1531734526019.jpg","title":"Lift horror Girl China slammed ceiling lift tying string waist","story":"    Ruirui is pulled up by the waist after typing a rope around herself before going into the lift          She is slammed to the ceiling as the lift went down from the 23rd floor in a building in ChinaThe battle of the TOE: Contestants put their best foot...Driver survives after being impaled by four bamboo poles in...Share this articleRuirui was luckily saved after her elder brother quickly untied the rope from his waist and called the lift back to the 23rd floor.It\u0027s said that the pair were being looked after by their grandmother when the accident occurred in the Huadou district of Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, on July 10.The siblings reportedly found a rope and tied it to themselves while playing by the lift, according to Guangdong Public Channel.Ruirui then walked into the lift while her brother was standing outside.Surveillance camera footage shows Ruirui being pulled up in the air as the lift goes down.

Around me an army of eager, Lycra-clad men and women stand in neat rows, shoulder width apart, eyes widened. Ear-bleedingly loud dance music pumps through the speakers as Heidi and Chris Powell – the stars of US hit reality show Extreme Weight Loss – take the stage to lead an exercise class that will help us reach our ‘pain threshold’ and ‘burn optimum body fat’.Someone in the crowd screams. Another cries. It’s not yet 7.30am. Welcome to the first day of the world’s biggest fitness convention: Idea World, in San Diego, southern California.Dubbed the ‘superbowl of the fitness industry’, the annual event brings together more than 200 fitness industry professionals, trainers and celebrity weight-loss gurus, alongside 14,000 exercise fanatics from all around the globe.They flock to the four-day festival to find the latest innovations and trends in workouts, equipment and technology on offer. And what debuts here quickly makes its way into gyms across the Atlantic.Justin Webb: Why I\u0027ll stick with walking my labradoodle...I can cry and scream when I\u0027m running: TANA RAMSAY explains...Share this articleThe expo has launched countless products, machines and exercises during its 36-year run, from vibrating power plates to Zumba.As a long-time exercise-avoider with minimal muscle mass, I’ve always struggled to find an exercise class I enjoy. So, as the only British journalist invited to attend this year, would I discover one I could actually bear?COULD I GET MADONNA’S BOTTOM?The exhaustive list of almost 400 classes, workouts and evening activities at Idea World is overwhelming I commit to 25 classes over a period of 48 hours.Only the most sweat-inducing make my cut.After the Powells’ Extreme Transformation Workout, an endless series of muscle-toning exercises performed for three minutes at a time, I move on to a BOSU class: exercises practised aboard a squishy rubber dome.Instructor Alison demonstrates how to ‘paddle’ with my steel bar in hand, engaging the core and glutes for ‘bums and tums’ tightening.          Over the course of 48 hours, Eve tried out 20 different work outs at the Idea World fitness convention in San Diego, CaliforniaFinding my balance on the rubber sphere is tough enough let alone extending opposite arm and legs simultaneously. Remarkably, by focusing on a spot on the wall in front of me, I’m able to complete the rest of the routine with minimal wobbling.After Tae Bo, a mixture of martial arts and aerobics, comes Booty Barre – a class especially designed to build a beautiful bottom.The workout – whose fans include Madonna – draws on the principles of Pilates and ballet.As a regular Pilates goer, I was fairly confident I’d get through the hour with ease, but after five minutes of thrusting with a medicine ball between my legs – on tiptoes – I realise this isn’t the case.By the end of the class, my thighs are like jelly and I’m starving hungry. It’s 10am.BOOT CAMP, BOXING... AND BATTLE ROPESI decide to get the worst out the way before lunchtime: army boot camp.Developed by a former US sergeant, this is a 90-minute sweatathon involving jumping squats, lunges and sprints interspersed with military-style marches. Angry orders from Sergeant Ken Weichart (aka Sgt Ken) to ‘Embrace The Pain!’ keep me moving despite the agony but after 50 rapid squats and the sergeant’s demands to ‘get lower’, I succumb to the pain and embarrassingly stumble mid-rep. ‘No quitters here!’ Ken loudly reminds me.I manage a 30-minute lunch break before leaping straight into the on-site boxing ring for a couple of rounds with a bullish, bald-headed former champ.          This odd-looking device is supposed to provide a work out for bums and tumsTo my surprise, I can throw a mean punch and even manage a spin, kick and smack move.Then I move across to Battle Ropes. After 15 minutes of tutorial, we experiment with all 30 ways a 55 lb, 50ft rope can be moved about for a vigorous full-body workout.It’s not all about waving it with the hands – try jumping between two ropes for a quick warm-up, or lifting the ropes in between press-ups to work the core and arms. At the end of the class, I unashamedly collapse on the floor into a pool of my own sweat and admit defeat. Tomorrow is another day…TORTURE... FOR KILLER ABSOn day two, I explore the 500,000 square foot exhibition hall showcasing almost 400 cutting-edge fitness gadgets and machinery.I start with a demonstration of the latest vibrating Power Plate to hit US gyms. The machine stimulates muscles with vibration, increasing muscle tone when exercising. I expect to watch my love handles wiggle off my body without moving but unfortunately, some work is required. I try step-ups and single leg balances, before moving on to planks, bridges and seated crunches – all aboard the vibrating platform. Each exercise feels ten times more intense than I’d ever experienced before, with ripples of pain shooting through my entire body.Converts claim that those ten minutes of excruciating torture are the fastest route to killer abs.Other highlights of the exhibition include a 6ft stair-climbing machine which, on maximum resistance, feels five times harder than normal stairs a virtual-reality treadmill that sends me running through the French countryside and a cycling machine called Real Ryder which tilts 22 degrees and emits stimulating vibrations. I disembark the bike, feeling two stone lighter, and seek out an upper-body exercise to give my legs some well-earned rest.

These writers, and plenty of others who have taken part in the competition, have won prizes, sold books all over the world and helped build our shared literary culture. Once those nominations are in, we’ll compile our traditionally very long longlist and run a public vote to whittle those books down to five. That’s right: five. Like last year, we will then add a wildcard entry nominated by the excellent judges who helped us to choose the 2017 winner.When we’ve got those six books lined up, we’ll read each in turn at the rate of around about one a week, igniting further discussion, debate and – let’s hope – admiration and love. Then there’s the final vote, the judges’ panel and the beautiful moment when we get to bestow an actual  mug on the lucky winner.If you’d like to find out more details about the process, all ye need know is contained in our beautiful and truthful terms and conditions. And if you’d like to contribute a little more than your valued wisdom below the line, we’d love to hear from you about joining this year’s judging panel.The Not the Booker has always been about uncovering new talent, about finding voices ignored by the mainstream and I’m hoping for another excellent competition.

What’s happening where you live?Whether summer in your city is present or past, there is a good chance you weathered record-breaking temperatures this year. Climate change in cities is frequently discussed in terms of flooding or storms – but its most dangerous consequence may be heat. Air conditioning, private transport and water engineering have allowed urban settlements in arid areas to expand at a dizzying and unsustainable rate, while outdated paradigms of urban planning and design give little relief from rising temperatures.Cities around the world may find their water use restricted – Cape Town, South Africa and Shimla, India have already have already come dangerously close to “day zero”, when taps run dry – and their power infrastructure compromised by reliance on air conditioning. Standards of living are likely to fall. Heat islands, droughts and disrupted seasons will likely lead to more deaths – particularly among the young, the old and those with health issues. Cities will be publishing a special week of journalism next month investigating heat in cities, and we want to hear from you.How are rising temperatures affecting or changing your city?

Yes. That’s true for his billionaire friends. Not so true for tens of millions of workers.On Monday night, at a town hall meeting that will be livestreamed, we will discuss what rarely gets seen or heard in mainstream media. And that is that despite the fact that the unemployment rate in the US is relatively low, real inflation accounted for, wages for the average American worker continue to decline and 140 million Americans lack the resources to pay for housing, food, childcare, healthcare, transportation and a cellphone without going into debt.All over America workers are asking themselves why, if the economy is “booming”, are they forced to work longer hours for lower wages. Why, if the economy is “roaring”, are they not able to afford childcare, send their kids to college or put aside enough money for a decent retirement.The American people also want to know why, as taxpayers, they have to subsidize and provide corporate welfare to the wealthiest and most profitable corporations in the country. How does it happen that there are major corporations in America where CEOs receive extravagant compensation packages, who pay their workers wages so low that many of them are forced to rely on food stamps, Medicaid and public housing – subsidized by taxpayers – to survive?I could be wrong, but I doubt that you will ever hear these questions asked in the corporate media. That is why on Monday night, 16 July at 7pm ET in the US Capitol, we will be holding a town hall meeting with low-wage workers from Amazon, Disney, Walmart, McDonald’s and American Airlines. This town hall will be livestreamed on my Facebook page. Importantly, we have invited the CEOs of these corporations to sit on a panel with their own employees. Tune in to see if they have the courage to show up.Here are just a few facts about what is going on inside these corporations:Over the past few months, my staff and I have spoken with workers at several of these companies who are struggling desperately to provide for themselves and their families.A Walmart worker told us: “Right now I just can’t make ends meet. I’ve been on the verge of eviction for falling so far behind on my rent. I’m getting by on food stamps.” Another worker from Florida said: “Even after Walmart’s company-wide wage increase to $11 an hour, I cannot afford to pay my bills … Although I’ve been here for almost two years, I make the same $11 that someone walking through the door makes.” Another in Texas said: “At Walmart, you work as hard as you can it’s always the same. ‘Ladder of Opportunity?’ There’s no such thing. You work and you work, but you can’t get ahead.”One McDonald’s worker told us: “We’re tired of surviving, we want to live. We can’t even survive off $7.25.” Another said: “We don’t want to rely on assistance programs anymore or figure out how we’re going to pay our rent or afford our next meal.”An American Airlines worker told us: “I can barely pay for my car now, half of my rent. Poverty wages just don’t cut it.” Another said: “I work 20 extra additional hours a week because we have a mortgage, we have bills, and plus we have college tuition … I’m just so overwhelmed. All the time, I’m tired. I don’t have time with my girls or my husband either,” and: “I talk to some of my coworkers and sometimes I bring groceries for them because they have nothing to eat.”An Amazon worker told us: “I gave myself a hernia trying to hurry up and go to the bathroom within one minute and 30 seconds.”A Disneyland worker told us: “I currently don’t make enough to eat three times a day. I eat cans of tuna or celery sticks and carrots because that’s what I can afford. I typically eat once sometimes twice a day because I can’t afford three meals a day.”At the town hall meeting that will be livestreamed on Monday night on my Facebook page, we will be hearing from these workers and discussing how we can create an economy that works for all of us, not just those on top. I hope you will join us."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7763cb77712a73dcec107ed1f4b893fd174cd985/0_99_3543_2125/master/3543.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e45c11e207f832e85be50de39f9c747e","title":"children learn cycle miss out","story":"Cycling makes children confident and fit. It’s a national scandal that so few have a skill that is as basic as readingI would sit on our front doorstep watching in awe as my brother did wheelies on his BMX, whizzing up and down our cul-de-sac with his friends – with me looking on enviously, but never asking to have a go.It was just not the done thing. Growing up in a Pakistani household in inner-city Birmingham I had never seen any of my female peers cycling. It’s not something that I discussed with my parents they weren’t against it, but they never encouraged it either. It was ingrained that perching atop a saddle in a salwaar kameez (traditional Pakistani dress) was un-ladylike. So I never learned.But then at the age of 17 I suddenly found myself living in rural Cambridgeshire, with the nearest bus stop to get to college more than a mile away – it was time to get on my bike. A boyfriend decided he would teach me, and I spent weekend after weekend in a disused quarry, wobbling up and down a dirt track. There were falls into stinging nettles, tumbles over handlebars, and a complete inability to ride in a straight line. But eventually – admittedly with little finesse – I was able to stay on.Fast forward almost 18 years, and last week saw me cycling just over 13 miles into work for the first time, on canal towpaths, over motorway bridges, and along a busy main road into Manchester city centre. I was a sweaty, nervous wreck by the time I sat at my desk, but I had done it.I often wish that I had been taught how to ride a bike as a child, because I carry around an added anxiety whenever I saddle up. There are many consequences of not learning early on in life: you miss out on the freedom that it affords you, the health benefits, the expansion of social horizons. So recent research that more than a third of British primary school children have never been taught how to cycle is worrying. The traditional pursuit is said to be in decline as time-pressed parents are not taking their youngsters to parks. The study, by the charity Keep Britain Tidy, suggests the outdoor skills traditionally learned by children could be dying out.Earlier this year, seeing my four-year-old son going from a precarious wobble to an exhilarating freewheel on his pedal bike was wonderful. His little face lit up with the sheer joy of travelling under his own steam. Laura Hales, from the campaign group Cycling UK, says children are being failed. Almost a third of children are overweight or obese in this country. “School-age children need to be doing at least an hour of vigorous physical activity every day, and ideally significantly more – and we are seriously failing. One of the easiest ways to get children to exercise is through what we call active travel, through cycling and walking, because you can do it on your way to school.”For Hales the situation is becoming desperate, and she calls for a complete cultural shift that would allow children to use their bikes on a daily basis within their communities. “This is the fattest generation of kids that we have ever had, and the problems it is storing up for them when they get older is really frightening. We shouldn’t just blame the parents. We as a society need to take more responsibility, stop using our cars, and change the way our roads are built to encourage more cycling and walking. Only then will things begin to really change.”In Greater Manchester a thousand miles of safe cycling and walking routes are to be created after a campaign by the Olympic gold medallist Chris Boardman. The network – named Beelines, in homage to Manchester’s civic symbol of the worker bee – includes 75 miles of Dutch-style segregated lanes, and will be the largest joined-up network in the UK. A Beeline sign, as Boardman’s mantra has it, would indicate that “a competent 12-year-old” – the proxy he uses to indicate a vulnerable road user – would be safe.Jo Somerset and Liz Clarke set up BikeRight!, a cycling training company , to empower everyone in the UK to cycle with confidence. They run a course, Bikeability, in British schools to make children feel more confident on roads. At Velo-city 2017 – the annual cycling summit in the Netherlands – they discovered that children in that cycling nirvana have weekly traffic education classes, and at the age of 11 every child takes a proficiency exam similar to a driving test.“In the Netherlands it is part of their culture, and they really encourage children to play outside, to be free, to ride bikes. And they also have the infrastructure,” says Somerset. “From the conference we learned that we have to start young, you have to start in nursery school. Schools need to have bikes available. We have got children who are not nearly active enough. It is perfectly within the realm of possibility for the education sphere to take on teaching children to ride bikes.“Every child should be able to ride a bike, just like every child learns how to swim and read a book. It is one of the very basic skills.”Not learning to ride a bike at primary-school age has left me with a feeling of trepidation every time I cycle. I doubt I’ll ever be truly confident on a bike now, but I won’t let that stop us enjoying cycling as a family. Watching my son ride, he does not carry an ounce of my anxiety, and that is because he was on a bike pretty soon after learning to put one foot in front of the other. I’ll do the same with our daughter, who is almost one, so she won’t just be watching her brother’s wheelies from the doorstep – she’ll be doing them herself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b472643fb771a38655cd7d78e9898a7a998b8fe8/0_76_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39859685bd2bb4c4942ad1e69bda652f","title":"second referendum brexit negotiations justine greening","story":"An eerie truth is starting to dawn. Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn agree on Brexit. They are both realists. They know Britain needs a customs union with the EU. Perhaps they should go off to a Welsh mountain together, and do a TrumpPutin? Either way, it is time for parliament to offer united support to Britain’s negotiators in Brussels, as it did to the leave decision on article 50.On Sunday, May’s former education secretary, Justine Greening, added to her misery by calling her Chequers negotiating compromise a fudge. All compromises are that. In truth Chequers was a tactical way-station to the inevitable: a customs union. It was not ideal, but it was progress, and anything else is fantasy. Greening complains May’s union would leave Britain with “no say on shaping” EU trade rules. But that is what leave meant. In reality, Norway, the US, even China, have plenty of say on trade rules with the EU where it affects them. Trade on goods with the EU is a trivial aspect of Brexit.Greening, a desperate remainer, joined calls for a second referendum on Brexit, though on the BBC’s Today programme she confused a referendum on “the Chequers deal”, which she calls unworkable, with a referendum on “the final negotiated deal”, which is as yet unknown. The idea of asking the electorate its opinion during a negotiation is absurd. The constitutional position is clear. The vote was “to leave the EU”. It is for parliament and those negotiating on its behalf to decide how.According to Greening, parliament is in stalemate over Brexit, yet there is wide parliamentary support for customs union. The jam is party political. This week promises more chaos over amendments to the Brexit bill, but out of it must come a “coalition of sanity” in favour of customs union. Britain’s negotiators in Brussels cannot go on talking when the other side knows they have a ided political community behind them.The reality is that the argument over a customs union is a distraction, largely because it has allowed the hard Brexiters to talk about “making our own trade deals”, when this is pie in the sky. Every poll of leave voters shows them uninterested in trade barriers with Europe. What they wanted, and still want, is a degree of immigration control. This wholly separate issue is hotly debated across Europe at present, and can at least be put on hold. When this process is over and Britain has embarked on a transitional period of leaving the EU, it might indeed be sensible, as in 1975, to heal the bruised body politic with a second referendum. The mind boggles at the consequence of it being lost. More plausible would be for parliament to agree to seek a fresh electoral mandate for the leadership of post-Brexit Britain. Then I suspect we shall wonder what all the fuss was about."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09c1bbfa2773b3c6ff6e5a121ea5825b6450d898/0_144_5396_3237/master/5396.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=163893171e234979483607ea7f23c731","title":"world cup heroes lgbtq people russia stonewall","story":"As Dejan Lovren raised his hands to grab a protester sprinting across the pitch during the 2018 World Cup final, teenage sensation Kylian Mbappé raised his to high-five another. It seemed to some like the youngest player to score in a World Cup final since Pelé in 1958 understood something to which many of his older peers were oblivious: that the bravest people at the Russian World Cup were a group of people who weren’t even meant to be on the pitch that day.Football, we are led to believe by misogynists, is “a man’s game”. What we saw from the members of Pussy Riot on Sunday put into stark contrast the narrative we hear from commentators about “bravery” and “heroics” on the football pitch.Here was a group of three women and a man, some of whom who had already served prison time, showing actual bravery at the risk of very real and serious consequences. More than that, they highlighted how totally disheartening this World Cup has been for queer people across the planet. This was the day of the final and it was the first act to draw attention to any of Russia’s numerous and grave failings.For the opening game, Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, sat alongside Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as Fifa placed two of the most repressive regimes for LGBTQ+ people at the centre of their footballing showpiece. Nobody protested. Nobody spoke about Russia’s record. Nobody dared dull the shine of Worldcupville, Russian Federation edition.When it was announced in 2010 that Russia would host the 2018 World Cup, there was an outcry across the world because of the country’s appalling LGBTQ+ record. And in the years since, things have only got worse. Putin has made it illegal to promote “non-traditional sexual relationships”. Simply telling someone you are gay or lesbian or trans or whatever letter on the rainbow you claim is considered “promotion”. I could go on. Russia’s offences against the queer community are as numerous as they are heartbreaking. But for 30 days in Worldcupville, everyone decided to forget all that and just get on with having a good time.We see the same sort of token concern every year around Pride. Companies are quick to switch out their avatars for something rainbow-tinged. For 30 days of the month they let us all know that they’re cool with the queers. But that’s all most of them ever do. They apply a Facebook border and then forget about it until it’s time to change it back.Stonewall’s Rainbow Laces campaign is superb for raising awareness. You can tell by how many idiots on Twitter ask where the laces are for Straight Pride. Why did not one single player wear them in Russia? Countries were happy to pay a fine for wearing non-regulation kit for other reasons. England paid £50,000 because they pulled on socks made by the “wrong” company. Twice. Thousands of pairs of laces were sent to players. None were worn.Months before the tournament started, the FA’s chief executive, Martin Glenn, said he was “proud” to wear a Rainbow Laces badge in Russia when he donned one for the draw. He must have forgotten to pack it for the tournament proper, though. If he did wear it again, not a single mention or image of it can be found online. It’s not really a protest if nobody notices.Fifa, of course, bans all political displays. Is the LGBTQ+ cause actually political? That’s an argument for another day. However, we saw Granit Xhaka and Xherdan Shaqiri celebrate their goals against Serbia by making an Albanian double-headed eagle gesture with their hands. Players are willing to ignore Fifa’s directives when it suits them and suck up any fines that come their way. If they want to protest against something, they will. Their inaction during this tournament spoke volumes for their concern for their LGBTQ+ fanbase.This World Cup will soon fade from memory and the Premier League will take centre stage once again. November will roll around and football clubs will unpack their rainbow laces for a day before shoving them back in the locker until next year. In Russia, queer people will still face atrocities that go largely unreported in the rest of the world.And us queers? We are left to hope that people such as Pussy Riot continue to show more balls than all of football combined, and that the younger players such as Mbappé continue to get it. Maybe then we might finally see some meaningful change."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e3f602dffee4cec2fc33f8c49842bbe0787f81b/0_167_5023_3014/master/5023.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14077ef3cab8d87897978aac090e6788","title":"pedallers pilgrimage britains best cycling routes","story":"Wild Cycling author Chris Sidwells shares nine of his favourite rides – from the rugged west Highlands of Scotland to the green and pleasant loops of the home counties  These rides are my choices based on a wide variety of cycling experiences. Don’t consider the routes prescriptive – they are merely an introduction to the possibilities for cycling in different parts of the UK. Use them as a basis for your own exploration of nine parts of the country, each offering a unique day’s cycling.Full English: the Chiltern Hills, BuckinghamshireDistance: 37 milesDifficulty: 610Start and finish: Princes RisboroughNearest station: Princes Risborough“England’s green and pleasant land” perfectly describes the Chilterns. Broad-leaf woods overhang deep seductive lanes that wriggle around and over these chalky hills. Red kites rule the sky, and cricket is played on village greens. The Chilterns are commuter country now, but still charming, and still very English.Head for Chinnor on the north-west edge of the hills, then ride towards them to pick up a cycle-way going south-west to Watlingon, where you leave the trail. Climb Watlington Hill, then go through Christmas Common and Turville Heath take a pitstop at the Barn cafe at Turville Heath Farm, which is excellent. Continue to Marlow, then head north-west along the B482, leaving at Stokenchurch, and go north through the lanes to Princes Risborough.The most unexpected: Dengie Peninsula, EssexDistance: 24 milesDifficulty: 410 (810 if it’s windy)Start and finish: Burnham-on-CrouchNearest station: Burnham-on-CrouchSqueezed between two rivers, just 24 crow-flying miles from the centre of London, there’s a time capsule called the Dengie Peninsula. For a basic loop, follow the B1021 north towards Bradwell, go left after Tillingham through Maylandsea and Latchington, then follow the B1010 back to Burnham-on-Crouch. You ride through rosy brick and painted clapboard villages, past a patchwork quilt of fields. There are little loops you could add, such as visiting Dengie Marshes where you might glimpse a rare hen harrier. It’s so quiet, so peaceful, it’s like riding through the 1950s. Distance: 45 milesDifficulty: 810Start and Finish: BodminNearest station: Bodmin Parkway A ride of stunning sea views with a taste of wild moorland. Follow the Camel Trail from Bodmin to Wadebridge, leaving at the old bridge for Port Isaac, a beautiful Cornish fishing village and location for TV’s Doc Martin.  Continue north on the clifftop road, then join the B-road to Delabole, where you turn left and descend to Trebarwith Strand and its gorgeous beach. Continue north through Tintagel, for an unmissable mid-ride snack at Pengenna Pasties. Then it’s on to Boscastle, where you head inland through Camelford to St Tudy. Go left just outside St Tudy, to experience Bodmin Moor and its villages, before picking up the Camel Trail back to Bodmin. Best urban ride: the Taff Trail, CardiffDistance: 32 milesDifficulty: 510Start and finish: Cardiff BayNearest station: Cardiff Central “We’ve had it done up,” the Welsh comedian Rhod Gilbert says when describing Cardiff. And it has been done up, especially the waterfront of Cardiff Bay, where this ride starts. It’s a glorious place to pootle around on a bike. There are plenty of cafes to choose from – but save them for later, when you get back.  The Taff Trail mixes cycle-ways with quiet roads and is well signposted. This ride is 32 miles there and back to Pontypridd, but you can go on to Abercynon in the Rhondda or even do the whole 55-mile-long Taff Trail and reach the Brecon Beacons. The cycle-way sections are ideal for family rides.Best rite of passage ride: the Strines, SheffieldDistance: 22 milesDifficulty: 810Start and finish: LangsettNearest station: Penistone The Strines is 11 miles of unclassified road on the eastern edge of the Peak District, running from Langsett on the A616 to Moscar Fields on the A57. It’s brutal the road plunges into and out of three steep-sided valleys, with plenty of undulations and exposed moorland in between. Head south from Langsett, keeping right at all junctions, to the A57. Turn around and ride back. The Strines both ways is a local rite of passage, and the hills form part of many local training rides. There are six big climbs if you go both ways, ranging between a third and a half a mile long. Oh, and there’s the Bank View cafe in Langsett. It’s very special. Best cafe ride: Selby, West YorkshireDistance: 24 milesDifficulty: 510Start and finish: SelbyNearest station: Selby A pleasant ride through quiet lanes with a cafe stop about halfway. Start at Selby Abbey (fact: the Rt Rev Dr John Thompson is actually known as the Biking Bishop of Selby), find the B1223 and go north then west to Sherburn in Elmet. Elmet was an ancient British kingdom covering much of what is now West Yorkshire. From Sherburn go south to Hillam then Birkin for the cafe, the Birkin Fisheries Tea Room, which stands in its own grounds – there’s a lake, the food is delicious and the service always smiling. Once re-fuelled, head east to West Haddlesey, then north to Gateforth and on, north-east, to Selby.  Distance: 35 milesDifficulty: 910Start and finish: UlphaNearest station: Broughton in Furness Two of the steepest road climbs in the UK – plus others, long and short – give this ride a total altitude gain of 1,800 metres. The first seven and a half miles from Ulpha to Cockley Beck has only one climb, then you are at the foot of Wrynose heading east with the pass before you. Engage your lowest gear and haul yourself over – there’s no way of finessing it.  Descend to Little Langdale, climb over to Great Langdale. Go right in Elterwater, right at the next junction for Wrynose, then clamber over Hardknott Pass. Continue to Eskdale Green and turn left for the long slog over Birker Fell and back to Ulpha. This ride hurts – but the satisfaction of doing it lasts a lot longer than the pain it causes.The quietest: the Cheviot Hills, NorthumberlandDistance: 47 milesDifficulty: 710Start and finish: RothburyNearest station: Alnmouth (for a regular service) Rothbury is a country town like country towns used to be – gentle and homely, where people enquire about a person’s health and actually want to know the answer. The ride is out and back, mostly uphill out and downhill coming back, tracing the River Coquet almost to its source.  Follow the B6341 west from Rothbury. Take the first right after Hepple then keep left all the way to the end of the road, where if you stop for a moment you will probably hear no other evidence of human life but the sound of your own breath. Refuelling at the Barrowburn Tea Room near the turnaround point is highly recommended.The wildest: Ardgour and Moidart, west HighlandsDistance: 81 milesDifficulty: 810Start and finish: Fort WilliamNearest station: Fort William I saved the best till last. Any ride with a ferry crossing starts ticking wild boxes for me, but this gets a lot wilder. It’s mostly on main roads, but they will be the quietest main roads you’ll ever ride. The busiest, the A82, is first, going south-west from Fort William to the Corran Ferry Terminal. Marvel at the mountains as you cross Loch Linnhe. Then it’s on the A861 west through glens, alongside salty sea lochs, over the tip toes of mountains, around the Sound of Arisaig, where the Isles of Rum, Eigg and Muck are grey-green jewels in a sea setting. Finally you’ll head back to Fort William, and in fine weather the whole of Ben Nevis can be seen. Ready to hit the road? Why not make it count?

But if you had to guess any of them, including the forthcoming Mission: Impossible – Fallout, you could safely say either: “Tom Cruise goes rogue”, “Tom Cruise goes after someone who’s gone rogue”, or possibly “Who cares? Remember those awesome stunts!”And, basically, you’d be right. The previous instalment featured all three: it had a secret spy project that had gone rogue. To infiltrate it, Cruise’s Ethan Hunt had to go even roguer (and hang on to the outside of a plane). In case you’d forgotten, it was called Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, although that could be the title for any of them, and many other movies besides.Jason Bourne was never knowingly un-rogue. Daniel Craig’s James Bond has gone varying degrees of rogue in pretty much every movie (Quantum of Solace in particular), as have many Bonds before him. Jennifer Lawrence’s Red Sparrow was a Russian spy who went off-message. Felicity Jones defied orders and saved the rebellion in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story Captain America had similar ideas and took half of the Avengers with him. Vigilantes such as Batman have permanent rogue status. Even Vin Diesel turned on his Fast and Furious buddies. Why can’t anyone just stick to the programme?You could read Tom Cruise’s persistent rogueism as a coded bid to break free from his Scientological shackles but, in the wider sense, it’s now accepted in the movies that rules and orders are the preserve of villains and wusses. The real heroes are those who go against the herd.In the real world, however, it doesn’t usually work out like that. When government operatives go rogue in real life, they are more likely to be persecuted (eg Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning). Then again, look at Donald Trump. Going rogue – defying the establishment, the elites, the Deep State, the mainstream media – is what populist politics purports to be all about. Trump trailblazer Sarah Palin even called her memoir: Going Rogue: An American Story. It might be a stretch to blame Cruise for Trump, but Cruise has at least highlighted how meaningless a term “going rogue” has become. It can denote courageous sacrifice or dangerous recklessness. Looking at the state of the planet, perhaps we could do with a bit less going rogue and a bit more, you know, agreeing on some rules and sticking to them. Trouble is, that sounds like the most boring movie ever. If only there was a franchise-friendly action hero who could make “not going rogue” into a really exciting movie. That just might be Mission: Impossible. Mission: Impossible – Fallout is in UK cinemas from 25 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19cc7ce2af7ebaa5db965b968bee80c01fefd0ed/76_145_4144_2487/master/4144.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b36ed2f2fcd870170c0d21056d7d1683","title":"doubted to dominator paul pogbas world cup evolution","story":"The midfielder came in to the tournament with concerns about his role in the team he ended it dabbing and dancing as the heart of the France sideIf ever there was a time for Paul Pogba to dab and dance, to snapchat and sing to his heart’s content without giving a soul with any sense the opportunity to even tut, this was it. With Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium his stage, he dabbed with president Macron. He dabbed with his mother and brothers on the pitch. He dabbed with an iconic 36.8cm piece of sculpted gold that means everything in football. A world champion, a scorer of a goal that felt result-defining in the final, a fulcrum for his team, a massive personality revered back home, the only thing missing was a hairdresser on hand to create a World Cup-shaped cut to mark this most glorious of moments.With Pogba in his exuberant element – the master of social media filming non-stop in the dressing room, on the bus, encouraging all sorts of celebratory flourishes with his band of World Cup-winning brothers – he felt so central to everything about this French generation. During the course of this tournament his status within the group has changed, and even for his own teammates it was difficult to articulate exactly what it was and how it happened. But everyone could feel it. “I can tell you that Paul Pogba, I don’t know how and I don’t know from where, has become a leader,” announced Adil Rami. “He proved it to us. He showed it. He’s the one that showed the way. He was the strong man of the France team.”His evolution during this tournament into a new kind of force for Les Bleus, able to use his power, his presence and his technical skill set with an enhanced sense of responsibility and focus, is symbolic of how this team clicked into serious contenders during their month in Russia.Pogba being Pogba, when France arrived for this World Cup his role in the team was being debated. Polemics about his more enigmatic characteristics, the search for a way to get him to play his best and how to fit him in the tactical scheme of things, bubbled from the off. The scene was not unfamiliar as Didier Deschamps looked tense to be lobbed questions on the subject before a ball had even been kicked or an anthem sung.Kazan. France’s opening group game against Australia was not particularly convincing. The team laboured. They lacked creativity and cohesion. Still, Pogba influenced the outcome more than most. A clever through ball opened the game up to produce a penalty for their first goal – an assist of sorts – before he prompted and finished the move for the winner (later given as a own goal). Post-match, the Pogba inquisition started anew, prompting him to defend himself by batting away the negative vibes.“I am less entitled to make mistakes than others,” he mused. “I went from the biggest transfer in the world to the most criticised player in the world. Criticism is always here. When I was little, with my friends we always used to take the piss out of each other, saying: ‘You were good, you were bad.’ It’s about what happens on the pitch and I treat the criticism like I did when I was playing on the block as a kid. I never listen to it. I’m having fun and that’s the only answer I can give to all those people who criticise me or who think I am this or that.”Into the knockouts, Pogba became more and more influential. The critics in general grew quieter and quieter. Against Argentina he enjoyed himself as France glided through the creative gears. Against Uruguay he helped his team to control the game and minimise pressure. Against Belgium he was strong and disciplined, supporting the defensive work with a mix of aggression and diligence. Pogba showed many facets to his game, able to do what was needed in different situations.The connections he was making on the pitch became stronger. His bond with N’Golo Kanté flourished as a central midfield pair (albeit it was less effective in the final when Kanté strained to be his usual self). His instinctive understanding with Kylian Mbappé, as exemplified by that ravishing goal when they combined brilliantly as the teenager bounded on to Pogba’s sumptuous pass to ensure the final is remembered for some dazzling football as well as the strokes of first-half luck, is another major plus France take home from this tournament. As souvenirs go, a goal and an assist from that period of play will rightly be cherished by Pogba.15 July. There was Pogba’s face, illuminating one of the uprights of the Arc de Triomphe alongside the face of Zinedine Zidane adorning the other. For Pogba this is a powerful thing, linked to his own memories of the 1998 World Cup winners which is entwined with his love for his late father, Fassou Antoine. “I think about 1998, when I watched a video tape of the World Cup with my father, at home, on repeat,” he says. “We would watch it the entire time. Now I am a world champion. I miss my father, He is watching us. I think he would be very proud. This is for him.”In the aftermath of it all, Rio Ferdinand, with his Manchester United hat on, was quick to point to the challenge for his club to find a way to allow this version of Pogba, a more consistent dominator, to shine more at Old Trafford. But that’s for another day. For now, Pogba can deservedly express his French happiness any way he likes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6cadadb95f4ada298269fb4109dac11ac7d3774/0_0_2736_1642/master/2736.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7276fa8e13e5346a7d0cc7f27102f389","title":"gareth bale real madrid cristiano ronaldo julen lopetegui manchester united","story":"Gareth Bale is set to be handed the challenge of replacing Cristiano Ronaldo as Real Madrid’s driving force when he meets his new coach, Julen Lopetegui, for talks in the next two weeks.The move will disappoint José Mourinho as Bale is a long-term target of the Manchester United manager.

Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!After consuming a frothy cocktail of football and Tin for a month straight, The Fiver’s head is thumping like one of those massive Michael Mann-style helicopters today, reader. Ethics 2018 is over! What do we do now? We crack open another cold one and relive the tournament of course. So here we go. K’tish!Slurp! Let’s start with Sunday’s ludicrously fun final, when Les Bleurgh watched Croatia tippy-tap the ball around for most of the game before pocketing the World Cup trophy with room to spare because, more than any other team in Russia, they have had a tremendous sense of occasion. Perhaps Diddy Deschamps is a genius after all. In a modern game that loves pressing football more than Granny Fiver’s posh sister loves pressing flowers, the France manager sent his team out with instructions to meet Croatia’s fast and furious play with the kind of non-plussed shrug usually performed by a French concert goer in a Daft Punk mosh-pit. Lazy tactics you’d think. But no, Diddy knows best.“We did not play a huge game but we showed mental quality,” trilled Deschamps. “And we scored four goals anyway,” he honked, while flying through the Moscow air mid-bump. OK, so their first was an own goal and their second came via a farcical VAR-impacted penalty in which the referee watched the telly for the same duration of time as an episode of Emmerdale, but let’s not dwell on the facts. When Kylian Mbappé and Paul Pogba blasted home the third and fourth in style, it allowed Hugo Lloris to inject some physical comedy into proceedings with a slapstick six-yard box shimmy that gifted Croatia a goal and perhaps made Loris Karius come out in cold sweats.Not that everyone thought the final was as much of a hoot as we did. “We played well and played the best football and he gives a penalty to them. It kills you,” sniffed Luka Modric, as Dejan Lovren snapped a collection of Pussy Riot CDs into a million bits behind him. “I think we were the better team but sometimes better teams don’t win.” At least Modric can console himself with the Golden Ball, having been named player of the tournament after beating off strong competition from Eden Hazard, Mbappé and Vlad Putin’s Umbrella Guy.But the most miraculous thing about Ethics 2018 is how a tournament packed to the rafters with long throws, free-kicks, solid teamwork and corners still managed to deliver such high drama. If our tactics-obsessed cousin, Double Pivot Fiver, took a look back at the on-field trends, they’d determine it could have been curated by Tony Pulis. Possession? Pah! Inidual brilliance? Do one! Perhaps we were all hypnotised in the opening ceremony. Because even England were fun to watch and, apart from against that Panama Pub XI, they hardly had a shot on target. Forget Pep. We’re heading into football’s Era of Pulis. Thanks, Russia. K’tish!“We didn’t give up. We just don’t have the quality to run for 90 minutes at such tempo and speed like Everton. It looks like we gave up but this isn’t so. They are faster, stronger and better than us at everything” – ATV Irdning captain Hannes Wallner defends their display in Everton’s hard-fought 22-0 pre-season win.Here’s the final World Cup Football Daily podcast, with Max Rushden and co. The pod will be back for the new season soon.“In hindsight, we should have known England and Belgium would come up just a little short in this World Cup.

He was influential from the first game but by extra time of the Croatia v England game it was impossible to take your eyes off him. Modric has played more fluently but the way he dragged himself and his team through against the odds was breathtaking.Goal of the tournament It seems a long time ago now but Ricardo Quaresma’s trademark “trivela” for Portugal against Iran was a luscious piece of skill that bears watching time and again.Personal highlight It sounds a bit mawkish but watching the sun rise over Kazan Arena from my apartment, only a few hours after seeing France beat Argentina 4-3 there in a stunning game of football, gave rise to a feeling of immense gladness simply to be here. Nobody would take covering this tournament for granted.Biggest disappointment That we did not see a more erse tournament from the quarter-finals onwards. Europe’s primacy was disconcerting and, while we may have to wait to see if it is a trend, not entirely surprising. It was a regret off the pitch, too, because the vibrancy that tens of thousands of Latin American fans brought to the early stages was one of the aspects that made this month special.Trickiest off-field moment The weight of responsibility has rarely felt heavier than when, having booked a minibus to take yours truly and seven colleagues from Kazan to Samara in time for England v Sweden, the vehicle arrived an hour and 20 minutes late. That was the good news. A confused driver, who had somehow got lost en route to our apartment, then emerged and explained that (a) the sound on his sat nav had packed in and (b) he didn’t know the way to Samara anyway. At this point the risk of blank column inches across several of the UK’s major organs looked severe but, with the help of our phones and a rotation of front-seat assistants, we just about muddled through the six-hour journey in time to cover the quarter-final.Fondest memory of Russia Less a specific memory than simple pleasure that visiting supporters and locals interacted so joyfully and saw each other’s best sides. In regional cities such as Samara and Volgograd, particularly, one could see just how much it meant to people who had never experienced anything like this before the only shame is that so few fans from western Europe, in particular, felt emboldened to join in.What now for England? The good feeling of this summer must be bottled because normality will kick in soon and the reality is that, if England are to succeed, they need to ensure the best players are given a workable pathway to the top. The current crop are decent but not good enough to lift major trophies: until top clubs’ development processes tilt in favour of the players that will remain the case.Match of the tournament Portugal 3-3 Spain, a game which set the bar high for the tournament and probably gave both teams false hope as to their own capabilities in Russia. Cristiano Ronaldo was a force of nature, Spain pinged their passes and looked irrepressible and an upbeat tone was set for everything that followed. The World Cup, if not necessarily Spain and Portugal, lived up to expectations thereafter.Player of the tournament Eden Hazard. The Premier League has long grown accustomed to the Belgian’s genius but here he was illuminating the world stage. He provided goals, assists and mesmeric dribbles and will have been privately disappointed to finish only third, even if his declaration that his time at Chelsea may be up was a sting in the tail. Goal of the tournament Right-backs had some fun in Russia. Take your pick between Nacho’s goal, skimmed in off both posts, against Portugal and Benjamin Pavard’s stunning reward against Argentina.Personal highlight Jordan Pickford’s save from Carlos Bacca, and Eric Dier claiming a penalty shootout for England. Followed closely by the glory of The Motherland Calls and the Stalingrad memorial.Biggest disappointment Argentina, who I had bafflingly suggested might win the tournament. There was no pace, no energy and far too much reliance on Lionel Messi. They were fortunate to escape the group and beaten more convincingly by France than the 4-3 scoreline suggested.Trickiest off-field moment The flies, the flies, the flies of Volgograd, who swarmed all day off the Volga marshes. Oh, and the mosquitoes of Repino, who came out with a vengeance at dusk. My God, they loved me as much as I detested them. They will not be missed. That said, vanilla oil was a bit of a find, and more pleasant than DEET.Fondest memory of Russia St Petersburg. An incredible city, a glorious blend of Paris, Vienna and Amsterdam, with a dash of Scandinavia thrown in. It was heartening to see England’s players making the most of their days off to visit its sights, from the Hermitage to the Winter Palace, via the fairground.What now for England? For once England leave a tournament in a promising place. They have a plan, a manager with a vision and a crop of young players waiting in the wings to make their mark. The Nations League, which starts in the autumn, will not be straightforward but it could cultivate the renewed interest in international football. The World Cup was all about progress. Now they must maintain it.Match of the tournament Portugal v Spain.Player of the tournament Eden Hazard.Goal of the tournament Benjamin Pavard against Argentina.Trickiest off-field moment Because England did so well and Gareth Southgate became so popular, I was asked to wear a waistcoat in the TV studio. The crew were really excited about it but I wasn’t happy at all. I decided against it. Fortunately, they kept me on until the last day …Fondest memory I went to Volgograd before the World Cup and was overwhelmed, having visited the Mamayev Hill monuments and Rossoschka, a Russian-German military cemetery. It was a history lesson like I’ve never experienced.What now for England? Keep the team spirit alive and practise more possession and fewer set pieces.Match of the tournament Belgium v Brazil. For Belgium’s counterattacking masterclass in the first half and the breakneck drama after the interval. The pace and intensity were incredible.Player of the tournament I loved the way Paul Pogba handled himself but Luka Modric was the stand-out performer. I have long thought he was the finest central midfielder in world football and he oozed class and control. Showed his courage to step up in the last-16 shootout against Denmark, having missed a penalty in extra time.Goal of the tournament Toni Kroos v Sweden. OK, it seriously messed with me on deadline but the intelligence, technique and execution, with Germany’s World Cup hopes on the line, were extraordinary. I thought it would spark Germany into life. I was wrong.Personal highlight So many. Here are some. Watching Brazil live. Enjoying Tite (Cheechee). Being there for Mário Fernandes’s equaliser. Having a stroll in Gorky Park and Neskuchny Garden. People watching on Novy Arbat. Being on a fan bus packed with Colombians when the Colombia team bus overtook. Meeting Carlos Valderrama. Finding out what a good bloke Dejan Lovren is. The emotion at the final.Biggest disappointment Neymar was the coolest kid in the world at Brazil 2014. I remember him doing keepie-uppies as he strolled out for a training session and looking as though he did not have a care – as 200 million Brazilians invested their dreams in him. The king turned into a princess here. His theatrics did him no credit.Trickiest off-field moment My first full day was in Rostov-on-Don, where I was covering Brazil v Switzerland. I had to get to the stadium for the press conferences. There was no tube. I could not get an uber, yandex or regular cab. I had not yet discovered the game-changer that was the Google translate app. I was completely stuck and it was a horrible feeling. I would be saved by a big-hearted couple, whom I had met the night before, and they drove me to the stadium. It set a good tone.Fondest memory of Russia My take-away was the heartfelt desire of Russian people for their country to be appreciated. Every single Russian I met in every single city ran through the same questions. What do you think of Russia? What do you think of our city? And, invariably, what do you think of our women? It mattered to them that visitors departed with different perceptions. Moscow is now one of my top five cities.What now for England? Quite simply, to enjoy the positivity for as long as it lasts.Match of the tournament Belgium 3-2 Japan. I expected Belgium to stroll to victory but Japan were absolutely terrific. When Japan went 2-0 up, through Takashi Inui’s superb goal, James Ducker, from the , and I looked at each other in the press box as if to say: ‘What on earth is happening here?’ Belgium, to give credit where it is due, responded brilliantly. What a way to win the match, too – the best counterattacking goal I’ve ever seen.Player of the tournament Hard to look beyond Luka Modric, who has been so influential for Croatia in what will surely be his last World Cup, but let’s not ignore the contribution of N’Golo Kanté, even if the Frenchman would quite happily go under the radar. Kylian Mbappé deserves a mention too – he is going to be a superstar, if he isn’t already.Goal of the tournament Spoilt for choice. Benjamin Pavard’s strike against Argentina was tremendous. I also liked Nacho’s goal for Spain in their thrilling 3-3 draw with Portugal – what technique again. But I’m plumping for Denis Cheryshev’s second against Saudi Arabia. Elegantly stroked into the top corner with the outside of his left boot, it was a thing of beauty and set the tone for this World Cup.Personal highlight Watching and reporting on England in their first World Cup semi-final since 1990, when I was 14 years old. I never imagined for a minute that I’d find myself in that situation when I left for Russia. And what a moment when Kieran Trippier’s free-kick hit the back of the net. Let’s just not go there with what happened later.Biggest disappointment The amount of play-acting but in particular Neymar’s rolling around. It was embarrassing watching him at times and sad, too, given his talent. He’s not alone, though, and it has got to the stage where Fifa needs to confront the issue head-on. Sadly, it will probably ignore it.Trickiest off-field moment I could write a book on this one. I got lost quite a lot and didn’t master the metro in Moscow until day 30 (I went home the following morning). Getting in and out of the hammock in my apartment in Sochi was testing. And I somehow ended up with five courses after ordering soup for lunch in Saransk. Thank heavens for Google translate, which prevented more buffoonery like that and became my best friend.Fondest memory of Russia So many to choose from but I’d probably say walking to the Mordovia Arena in Saransk for Peru’s first World Cup game in 36 years. I remember turning this corner and seeing thousands and thousands of red and white shirts stretching as far as the eye could see. They were marching, singing, laughing and smiling – having the time of their lives. It was an extraordinary sight and gives me goose bumps whenever I think about it.What now for England? The balance doesn’t feel right in midfield and that showed against Croatia, so Gareth Southgate has got some work to do there. But let’s just be positive: there’s a feelgood factor that hasn’t been there for ages. Heck, I’d quite like to take my son to an England game now and I never thought I’d say that.Match of tournament I watched the group match between Spain v Portugal in a poky hotel room in Volgograd on a 13-inch TV made at least a couple of decades ago. But even that could not dampen the enjoyment of a game for the ages. It lived up to all the hype. As for that Ronaldo free-kick at the end, he just knew he was going to score. Incredible.Player of tournament Eden Hazard may not have reached the final but he was consistently brilliant for Belgium, turning in three man-of-the-match performances. He was still captivating his audience in the mixed zone after the third-place play-off, all but announcing that he wanted out of Chelsea.Goal of tournament Might be slightly coloured by the fact I saw it live but Jesse Lingard’s 25-yard curler against Panama – his first international goal – was a stunner. Yes, the opposition were limited and England were already well on their way to a rout but after watching him having lumps taken out of him all afternoon it was a welcome, beautiful interruption. Personal highlight Being inside Spartak Stadium to witness England finally win a penalty shootout. You try to remain impartial as a journalist but you also report what you experience and it’s impossible not to have felt some of Gareth Southgate’s joy that evening. He said afterwards he’d never get over the penalty miss at Euro 96 but you hope leading a team to a penalty shootout victory eased the burden.Biggest disappointment That Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo could not assert themselves more on the tournament. But that blow was softened by the emergence of another superstar in Kylian Mbappé.Trickiest off field moment Getting stuck in some pretty epic match-day traffic in Kaliningrad before England played Belgium there. We were still for half an hour about three miles from the stadium with the clock ticking closer to kick-off. Cue abandoning my taxi, hiring a bike from a nearby shop and cycling to the stadium over the main highway, which mercifully they had shut for the afternoon.Fondest memory of Russia Meeting a 17-year-old girl waitressing at a restaurant in Samara, a city 1,000km south-east of Moscow. When I told her I was from London, she could not contain her excitement. She wanted to know everything about England and we’re now friends on social media. In fact this whole trip has been a reminder not to confuse people with politics. Particularly the younger generation of Russians have been friendly, inquisitive and so welcoming.What now for England? To continue progressing, to blood new talent such as Ryan Sessegnon and Phil Foden. And to use the knowledge that Euro 2020 will feel somewhat like a home tournament, with seven games at Wembley, to train their sights on the future.Match of the tournament France 4-3 Argentina. If your heart didn’t soar at the sight of what Kylian Mbappé did here, you’ve no business watching sport (Argentinians excepted). The interweaving storylines, high emotions, brilliant goals, passing of batons and lurching drama made for an all-time classic. Player of the tournament Mulling this over in the days before the final the cases for Luka Modric and Mbappé felt particularly strong. Not much changed there during the final – both are absolutely deserving of the highest accolades – but something about Paul Pogba, the way he has commanded games, made his mark, played his role so emphatically for the team, and influenced the final swung it.Goal of the tournament Welcome to the old screamer versus purity of technique versus team goal dilemma. Belgium’s match-winner against Japan was seriously impressive especially in the context of a match they were trailing 2-0. Lionel Messi’s cushioned second touch against Nigeria is a thing of beauty in itself. Benjamin Pavard’s lasered volley just about gets my nod. Personal highlight Away from the stadiums, being in the evocatively named Snob Bar in Kazan riveted to the 3-3 humdinger between Spain and Portugal accompanied by high-speed house music and a guy lolling around in a giant polar bear costume for no obvious reason. In the stadium, seeing the Swedes and Mexicans start an impromptu dance-off to their “Bye Bye Germany” song after the dramatic, topsy-turvy ending to Group F. Biggest disappointment Not being able to lay my hands on a “Rock Arsenal” T-shirt – Ekaterinburg’s finest radio station, don’t you know – despite an extensive hunt. Trickiest off-field moment Trying to survive 90 minutes of Japan v Senegal sitting next to someone who had absolutely no idea how to manage some seriously intense body odour. Fondest memory of Russia Peruvians. They seemed to be everywhere I went. Watching the world go by from the banks of the Iset River in Ekaterinburg, somewhere I doubt I would have ever ventured to without this World Cup, was lovely and of course enhanced by little groups of wandering Peruvians. What now for England? Creativity. Find it, nurture it, encourage it, use it. A culture of doing well in tournaments is now in place across the age groups. Adding finesse at senior level is the missing ingredient that could make a telling difference. Match of the tournament Spain 3-3 Portugal, my first game, was quite a way to start a tournament in which I seemed to get lucky often (confession time: journalists don’t always feel “lucky” exactly when games are dramatic and decided by late goals). Even Switzerland-Serbia, supposedly a nice quiet night, turned out grand. Argentina-Nigeria inside the ground was quite something. But the best games were not mine. Enjoyed Belgium-Brazil (and, unfashionably, I think Brazil were good). But my favourite was probably Belgium-Japan. Player of the tournament Rakitic? Kanté? Mbappé? I’m leaning towards Eden Hazard and Luka Modric, not least because in true sports journalism style this judgment is being delivered before it’s actually over. In honour of this World Cup, could another rewrite be on the way after the final? Yes, it could. He may not have been the best but when it comes to what actually happened over the month, the things that players actually did, the impact they had, the effectiveness, the key moments, then Antoine Griezmann. Goal of the tournament 1. Cheryshev. 2. Cheryshev. 3. Cheryshev. OK, OK, it’s actually Toni Kroos or, better still, Belgium’s winner against Japan. Only it’s not for me: see also ‘personal highlight’, below.Personal highlight Watching the brutal beauty of Edinson Cavani’s goal against Portugal, a 100-metre one-two between him and Luis Suárez, the ball smashed from one side of the pitch to the other and back again, before flying in off Cavani’s face. Inside a stadium, I’ve rarely been hit – and it really did feel as if you’d been hit – by a goal quite like that. And then there’s Felipe Baloy scoring for Panama. Wonderful. Biggest disappointment In a word: Spain. Also, from a cynical point of view, I can’t help wondering what might have been for Belgium and Uruguay in the other half of the draw – two teams I would have liked to see reach a final. Off the pitch: not really getting the chance to experience Moscow which, when I was all too briefly acquainted with it, looked great. Or England-Colombia, for that matter.Trickiest off-field moment Being in A\u0026ampE worryingly close to kick off on England’s semi-final but I had left Russia by then so that probably doesn’t count. A cup, two tea bags, a tea spoon and no kettle: eh? The couple we thought had departed the restaurant and headed home returning just as we were ‘borrowing’ the still almost-full bottle of wine they had (or had not) left behind. Or how about the very, very first moment? Land in Moscow late, switch phone on ... Lopetegui’s done what, now?!  Fondest memory of RussiaMatch-day cakes in the hotel, of course. Football street lights. 2am sunrises and walking through St Petersburg at dawn.What now for England? Carry on, while recognising the reality beneath the feel-good factor. (England’s World Cup record is actually remarkably consistent.) Play, and try to play: there is plenty to be positive about. Be nice still. Nice is good. And nice doesn’t have to come last. Match of the tournament Maybe just because I was there, but I haven’t been more viscerally thrilled by a game for a long time than Belgium v Japan. If anything summed up the strangeness of this World Cup, it was a knockout game being turned round by Marouane Fellaini and Nacer Chadli.Player of the tournament Luka Modric. To play as well as he has would be remarkable under normal circumstances, but to do so with the looming prospect of a trial on his mind has been astounding.Goal of the tournament Christian Eriksen’s against Australia was probably the best I saw live, but just because it was so unusual I loved Benjamin Pavard’s against Argentina.Personal highlight The game wasn’t hugely memorable in the end but I was at Brazil v Switzerland. Watching Brazil at a World Cup is like visiting some sort of venerated monument: often not that impressive on the face of it but the history and stories behind it are inescapable.Biggest disappointment Morocco. I got swept up in gushing pre-tournament predictions and thought they might embarrass Portugal andor Spain, but their performances turned out to be akin to a limp bit of lettuce.Trickiest off-field moment It was broadly fine, other than the scandalous confiscation of my deodorant at the Luzhniki. Oh, and I was also stopped at a metro station and instructed to produce my passport, which I did not have on me. Brief visions of a future at Vladimir’s Big House flashed before my eyes but my press pass turned out to satisfy the lust for admin.Fondest memory of Russia People dancing in the Moscow streets after Russia beat Spain. The impromptu party that formed around a busking, instrumental post-rock band in a park was a particular highlight.What now for England? Here’s a hot take for you: I genuinely don’t know. In theory it should be bright, a talented young team due to be supplemented by further promising young talent coming through, but how often do theories work out in international football? I fear this will turn out to be one of those long, hot, strange summers that will feel as if it didn’t happen in a few years.Match of the tournament In the flesh, Spain versus Russia. Perhaps the most lop-sided match I’ve ever seen and one of the oddest. Sensible people will point to the fact Spain lost their manager and just didn’t play their system well. But still hard not to wax on about the limits of possession football and the weird agony of watching Spain pass the ball. Plus of course the hysteria of Russia and penalties.Player of the tournament Luka Modric. Best player for a tiny nation in the final. Ran further, aged 32, than any other player at the World Cup except his teammate Ivan Perisic. But of course it’s about the craft with Modric and his ability to drag a game his team’s way was of the highest class. Put him in five or six other teams here and they could have made the final too. Goal of the tournament Ricardo Qaresma for the one-off trivela-style curler, a wonderful piece of inidual skill he keeps on doing year after year. And Belgium in the last minute against Japan for the ultimate high-pressure team goal, made by Kevin De Bruyne’s laser-pass and Romelu Lukaku’s dummy.Personal highlight The absence of any fighting or trouble, not to mention mind games, wars of words, handshake-refusals or anything much apart from the football.Biggest disappointment Get a grip Brazil. This was once a team of tough guys, charmers and rogues. Nílton Santos, Jairzinho, Romário, Leônidas and Carlos Alberto are turning in their graves watching the current ing, weeping lot. And half of them aren’t even dead.Trickiest off-field moment After a lot of early running around – five flights in three days, five games in six days – I did briefly fall asleep on a stool in an airport departure lounge. When I woke up I couldn’t remember with any real certainty what city I was in. I looked at my boarding pass, but I wasn’t sure if it was the right one. Eventually asked someone.Fondest memory of Russia Football, people, meat, beer, beetroot, wide streets, huge buildings, all-night bars, amazing supermarkets and the busking folk dance duo from some conservatoire who popped up on the street in Moscow one night and performed an astonishing routine for a few roubles in a hat. This is from someone for whom the words “amazing folk dance” don’t exactly trip off the tongueWhat now for England? Fifty years of hurt.Match of the tournament Spain-Portugal kicked this tournament into high gear. Spain at moments played the best football of any country at the World Cup and both sides scored lovely goals, capped by Cristiano Ronaldo hiking up his shorts and curling that free-kick round the Spanish wall in injury time. Very satisfying draw.Player of the tournament Likely this should go to a defender or even a goalkeeper, but I will opt for Kylian Mbappé, whose speed has been dazzling. Goal of the tournament Toni Kroos’s free-kick. Set pieces played a central role and this one was their king: a beautiful strike from an impossible angle executed with cool German precision. The gif of this winner (with Marco Reus’s reaction) is mesmerising. Also an honorary mention to Denis Cheryshev’s goal against Croatia best Russian strike since Battleship Potemkin. Personal highlight This would have to be the citywide bacchanal after Russia’s shock win over Spain on penalties. Moscow is an extraordinary city but is not the world’s friendliest. Seeing a riot policeman politely tell a fan by the Bolshoi to stop spraying champagne on passers-by captured the spirit of this night for me.Biggest disappointment Denmark versus France. Any chance to give players a rest at a tournament must be hard to pass up for a manager but it’s a shame for fans to pay hundreds of dollars each to go and watch a match that neither team came to play.Trickiest off-field moment Balancing politics and sport as a Moscow-based journalist. Many fans blamed the English media for scare stories about Russia before the tournament, although I suspect they’re referring more to tabloid headlines than our coverage. In any case we should have nuance in our discussion of Russia, one that can acknowledge an excellent World Cup while recognising that it does not portray all aspects of life in this country. Fondest memory of Russia South and Central American fans invading Moscow in a riot of colour and realising that we had a whole month with them in town.What now for England? I learned during the tournament that Pizza Hut once dedicated an entire commercial to England’s penalties problem. How great then that a young squad with years of play ahead of them have banished that particular demon. I’m not sure if football can come home during the Euros, but I look forward to finding out in 2020. Match of the tournament Spain 3-3 Portugal. Everything: wonder goals, Cristiano Ronaldo’s hat-trick and so early in the competition it left the clear sense we were in for a special tournament.Player of the tournament Luka Modric. The crowd’s reaction when he was named as the Golden Ball winner told its own story. One of those players – and they are rare – you always want on the ball. Goal of the tournament Cristiano Ronaldo (the third one) v Spain. He blew out his cheeks. He hitched up his shorts. He knew damn well the world was watching. And then he put it in the top corner, past one of the greatest goalkeepers I have ever seen. Honorary mentions to Nacho (from the same game) and Benjamin Pavard (France v Argentina).Personal highlight Seeing Russia in a new light (and yes, I know there’s another issue entirely when it’s not on its best behaviour), collecting my ticket for the final (always a privilege), beating Jamie Vardy at pool in a Nottingham Forest v Leicester City grudge match (in my head, anyway) and the little bits of spare time to look around St Petersburg and Moscow properly.Biggest disappointment Not having time to look around properly and – this might surprise you – seeing so little football. That’s the problem when you are on the England beat: you tend to be in press conferences, writing against deadlines or mid-air (19 flights) when the other games are on. After 22 days in Russia I’d watched three live matches.Trickiest off-field moment 1) The waitress in my hotel in Volgograd who didn’t speak a word of English and signalled that she would get a colleague to come over, then did a slit-eye gesture to show who she meant. What do you say? 2) The high-ranking FA official pointing out (with great suspicion) my Fjallraven T-shirt had a Sweden flag as its label. Five minutes before kick-off, England v Sweden.Fondest memory of Russia How much Moscow has changed since I first came here with Leeds in 1999 and again for the Champions League final in 2008. I don’t think I’ve ever been to a city where there isn’t a single spot of litter. St Petersburg, too. In five weeks I’ve seen one homeless person. It makes me despair when I think of Manchester, Liverpool, London and the numbers on the streets back home.What now for England? I’m torn. They were within half an hour of the final. Yet they also lost three out of seven games and seem incapable of beating any of the top teams. It wasn’t arrogant to say they were in the easier half of the draw, it was factual. Euro 2020 looks inviting, with both semi-finals and the final at Wembley, but I think England have blown the best chance they will ever get.Match of the tournament Belgium 2-1 Brazil.Player of the tournament Luka Modric.Goal of the tournament The collective move on the third Belgium goal against Japan.Personal highlight The madness provoked by Russia’s victory over Spain.Trickiest off-field moment The sacking of Julen Lopetegui two days before the start of the World Cup.Fondest memory of Russia Russia itself: a fascinating country.What now for England? Complete the journey they have just begun.Match of the tournament The match I enjoyed the most was Iran v Portugal, because of the intense late drama. A 93rd-minute equaliser for Iran and then a stunning chance to win it in the 96th minute. Had Mehdi Taremi scored rather than hit the side-netting, Portugal would have been flying home and Iran would have won the group. The kind of tiny margin on which World Cup runs are decided.Player of the tournament Luka Modric, for his own performances and for leading his Croatia team to the final. I watched Croatia’s first game, against Nigeria, and although they were largely uninspiring, even then Modric would occasionally pop up with an extraordinary 50-yard pass.Goal of the tournament Denis Cheryshev’s strike against Croatia in the quarter-final: a one-two with Artem Dzyuba before unleashing an unstoppable rocket from just outside the area. It was a beautiful goal by itself but a World Cup quarter-final that nobody expected Russia to be in was quite the time to score it.Personal highlight Kieran Trippier’s free-kick against Croatia. I’d been perfecting my media-tribune neutrality up to that point but couldn’t resist celebrating when that went in. And for about an hour it allowed us to believe that maybe it actually, really, genuinely could be coming home.Biggest disappointment It was sad not to see any of the African teams qualify from the group stage. Morocco in particular were devilishly unlucky in a tough group, as were Senegal. Trickiest off-field moment It’s amazing how covering sports tournaments as a journalist seems to end up with the unhealthiest eating regimen imaginable, due to the food available in the media centres. I don’t think I ever want to see a Twix again.Fondest memory of Russia I’ve lived in Russia for years and, while often reporting on gruesome and depressing stories, have tried to write about the more pleasant sides of life in Russia. For readers those pieces often get drowned out by all the terrible stuff going on, so it has been nice to watch so many people get to discover that fun, warm and exciting side of Russia that often gets hidden.What now for England? The future looks positive, though what a shame they didn’t sneak past Croatia and into the final. I can’t imagine they will ever get as favourable a draw and anyway it’s hard to get very excited about anything to do with the next World Cup, given it’s in Qatar.Match of the tournament Belgium 2-1 Brazil. A game that combined quality and drama won in part because of Belgium’s ability (the second goal, Thibaut Courtois’s saves), in part because of Roberto Martínez’s tactical switch to use Kevin De Bruyne as a false 9, and in part because they had the guts and resilience to hang on.Player of the tournament Luka Modric. Nobody expected Croatia to reach the final and they could not have done so without their leader Modric, who passed the ball more than any other member of their squad and ran further than anyone in the tournament bar his own teammate Perisic.Goal of the tournament Nacer Chadli, Belgium v Japan. It wasn’t just the slick interplay, the pace of the break or Romelu Lukaku’s movement it was the sense of occasion, a beautiful goal to finish off a wonderful second half.Personal highlight The final minutes of a tight game when you’re writing a match report to be filed on the whistle are always fraught, and especially when a major shock is brewing. You can’t quite believe Germany are going out, but with 10 minutes or so to go, you tentatively write your intro. Then, on 90 minutes, South Korea have a goal ruled out for what appeared an obvious offside. You type away, wondering why they’re making such a fuss. Then, out of the corner of your eye, you realise Toni Kroos touched the ball to Kim Young-gwon and that he is therefore onside. The entire press box seems to notice at the same time. There is moment of silence as the truth dawns on everybody – he has to give the goal and that means Germany, for the first time in 80 years, are out – then a flurry of keyboards being hammered. One of the great “Christ, this is happening ...” moments Trickiest off-field moment Trying to maintain a sense of perspective and calm while a four-year-old bounces around the compartment screaming for the first eight hours of a 22.5-hour train journey from Kazan to St Petersburg.Fondest memory of Russia Kazan, a beautiful and welcoming city that hosted a string of brilliantly dramatic games.What now for England? Hopefully use the experience as a basis to begin integrating all the youth champions of last year as they begin to play regular league football, while simultaneously recognising the value of a sensible, practical manager and acknowledging Gareth Southgate’s tactical failings. But probably more of the same old nonsense."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b58839c155deb84003241dc6a9f97700f0c3125/0_100_4920_2952/master/4920.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c61e5422817f34b00eee0a0e90a015d","title":"france celebrates world cup victory in pictures","story":"Celebrations carried on into the night after the national team beat Croatia in the World Cup final"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62b15578324e75dc289e0f37a5253c29c871f617/0_300_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08a97590ef69b5715319b39fe8b1c2d5","title":"nigeria poverty stricken families struggle survive","story":"Families living on £1.50 a day or less tell of the hardships of life in the oil-rich nation, which now has the greatest concentration of extreme poverty Nkechi John, 39, lives in a single room with her four children and husband, who is a welder. Their daily lives are fairly typical of people in poverty in Nigeria, which according to the Brookings Institution now has the world’s greatest number of extreme poor.“Most of my customers are bricklayers, plumbers, electricians. I couldn’t even sell all of the cake I made today to make up to 400 naira. “I am tired of life,” she says, adding she can believe poverty is now worse than in India. “The suffering’s too much. The president and government need to do something before we all die.“I try to do some farming, but there is no money to buy fertiliser and the crops have all turned yellow due to the lack of it. And only two of our school-age kids are in school because we can’t afford it.” Uche Joseph Uwaleke, an economist at Nasarawa State University in Nigeria’s central region, explains why there has been an increase in extreme poverty. “There is the issue of insecurity in the north-east. Although the Boko Haram violence has been reduced to a manageable level, local farmers in that region are still afraid of going to farms.“Despite the end of the recession, manufacturing, the transportation sector and agriculture have still not recovered.”He also blames poor governance. “The late approval and poor implementation of the budget is another reason for the growing poverty. All of this affects jobs.”Although Uwaleke sees glimmers of hope from policies to improve Nigeria’s chronic poverty he is concerned that the situation remains fragile.Life is also a struggle for Mohammed Ahmed, 33. The Islamic teacher and father-of-four comes from Borno state and now lives in Abuja. He and his extended family have just £1.50 a day to live on, including what he manages to send to relatives in Maiduguri to help them buy food.“Because of Boko Haram they cannot go to the farms because they are afraid they will be killed. Nobody is farming in Borno state except within Maiduguri, the state capital. But I can’t give them anything because I struggle to take care of my family.”Like Nkechi John, he also struggles to buy fertiliser he needs to grow the crops on his small farm. “The government says one 50kg bag should cost 5,500 naira but that is not even available. So we have to buy in the open market where the bag costs 15,000 naira. So I can’t afford to buy enough.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82eea2ebb3bad53689a819d17d8d0891520599d9/0_317_4558_2736/master/4558.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6caa96ea77924cc41c361da2b45819e","title":"rachel roddy recipe plum granita","story":"Iced treats are a summer staple, and this one is simple and simply deliciousUnlike ice-cream, which is evergreen, sorbet and granita don’t really have a role from late autumn to early spring. Like suncream and sandals relegated to the back of the wardrobe, fruit ices are sent to the back of the mind during the months of jumpers and thick soup, except maybe for a Christmas palate cleanser.Their return is directly related to the weather. As days get warmer – and, this year, sweltering – smooth scoops and icy shards progress from being a novelty, to a pleasure, to a relief, to an absolute necessity.These are days when cold showers and frozen things are essential. A spoonful of granita seems to slide down the throat, chilling as it goes. Making it, or a sorbet, by hand is like loitering in the frozen food section of a supermarket in August, enjoying the great wafts of icy air that drift from the open freezer doors.I am not sure if I should call today’s recipe a sorbet or granita. According to US writer Jeffrey Steingarten, the difference between a sorbet and a Sicilian granita is texture: sorbet is smoother, whereas granita has a coarser, more crystalline texture, often due to agitating with a fork. I use a fork, but achieve something that is quite smooth, which I will come to later, but for the sake of a title, let’s call it “granita”. The method is the same basic one I use for watermelon and mulberry granita – fruit juice or pulp is mixed with sugar, a pinch of salt, maybe lemon to sharpen the edges, then frozen. No real need for strict measures or a machine.Plum sorbet was necessary, because three kilos of reduced-price plums from Testaccio market turned out to be the wrong side of ripe. As I unpacked the rest of the shopping, which had sat in the car for two hours, the plums snaked on to the work surface like flat tyres into a pavement and welcomed a halo of fruit flies. Plum granita was the solution – and a revelation. I have always thought a ripe, red plum has something custardy about it, both in texture and taste. .It was the exceptional ice-cream maker Kitty Travers who taught me the additional sugar isn’t just to augment the natural sweetness of the fruit, it also has an important job to do: it changes the nature of the ice crystals, which means the granita is smoother, and also prevents it from freezing too hard. I reckon 1.2kg fruit to 200g sugar and a pinch of salt. Alcohol does this job, too, so you could substitute some of the sugar for a tablespoon or two of vodka, gin or kirsch. .1.2 kg ripe, purple plums200g sugar1 pinch of salt2 tbsp vodka or lemonWash the plums, then split them and remove the stones. Using a food processor or immersion blender, puree the plum flesh. Dissolve the sugar and a pinch of salt in 100g hot water, and add to the puree along with the vodka or lemon juice, and pulse again.Scrape the mixture into a glass or plastic box, then put in the freezer for a couple of hours, by which time it should be partially frozen, especially at the edges. Use a fork to scape the frozen mixture from the edges of the container and to scratch and disturb the surface, then put it back in the freezer for another hour.Repeat the scratching and return to the freezer until the granita is softly frozen. If it gets too hard, 10 minutes in a warm spot should make it soft enough to stirscratch, and serve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d87a449d4b2537bcc243dd917f8606bbf0f3d4fc/42_16_3145_1888/master/3145.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=721c27be1c1a566d27b5bf89ceef1d31","title":"russia 2018 world cup england guardian support","story":"Our senior sports writer Barney Ronay explains how you can help keep the ’s football coverage in playHere we are then.

PHA Until relatively recently, because of your age, if you didn’t have the money needed to pay off your interest-only mortgage at the end of its term, your choice would have been between selling up and downsizing or taking out an equity release plan to raise the cash needed to pay off the mortgage. Those options are still available to you, but as a result of the relaxation of the rules about the sale of interest-only mortgages by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), there has been a growing number of specialist “later life” lenders offering both interest-only and repayment mortgages to older borrowers excluded by mainstream lenders because of their age.

But featherlight blues and sober reflection are a tough sell live, particularly to holidaying punters drunk in rural Suffolk. “I want to turn this festival into church,” Solange informs the few thousand gathered, who were possibly happy with just a festival. It doesn’t help that her hour-long set, for all its laidback charm, doubles as a meticulous avant-garde dance show. So it’s a minor miracle when, midway in, her gentle punches start to land. “Fuck Trump,” she mutters at one point, and the congregation roars in agreement.The turning point is F.U.B.U., a black anthem in which the younger Knowles sister rallies “all my niggas in the whole wide world”, descending into the crowd to serenade four women of colour. A brass squall closes the song, and the set bursts open. She twerks, twirls and high-kicks in her white dress, like a superhero summoned from a dinner occasion. With a seven-piece band and supplementary six-woman brass section, it’s presumably the first Latitude headline set to climax with synchronised shimmying to an instrumental jazz tempest, and it’s a revelation. Debate around Solange’s headline-worthiness – the words “sexless Sade” could be heard muttered around camp – inadvertently spotlights its necessity. The remaining headliners are the Killers, whose stadium pop is so impersonal it could have been written by AI, and alt-J, a band named after a keyboard shortcut. Brandon Flowers’ crew prosper on the night: flanked by giant-screen representations that seem realer than he does, Flowers has a preternatural ability to turn mediocre material into transcendent singalongs, like a Silicon Valley clone of Bruce Springsteen.Their plastic star power dwarfs predecessors the Vaccines, whose tired indie pastiche prompted one unimpressed woman to leave, encounter her son and interrogate him until he promised to eat some mozzarella balls. Alt-J’s pleasantly histrionic groove ought to suit Latitude to a tee, but it’s one of a few tired sets that fails to match the magnificent surroundings. Leading post-punks Parquet Courts have been touring for so long that they seem exhausted not only with capitalism but their own music, while Liam Gallagher’s surprise set begins with Rock’n’Roll Star and Morning Glory, then swerves in his usual fashion between the sublime and sublimely dull. While some big names flounder, there’s buried treasure in the festival’s pockets. If you’ve ever shrugged unconvincingly when somebody asked how it’s going, then you’re familiar with Westerman’s songwriting mode, who plays delectably blase laments tucked away in an unassuming tent. Nao makes romantic insecurity and scandalously crap boys sound magical in a packed, wowed BBC Music stage. And as parents flock toward Belle \u0026amp Sebastian, teens with lit-up eyes assemble to raise hell and denounce “bougie bitches” with IAMDDB at the Sunrise arena. “If we could have pink lights to match pussy?” the Mancunian singer-MC requests, like a duchess liaising with her interior designer. In an aptly regal show, she twirls incense, hands out Hennessy and smokes fans’ weed, her low-key charisma providing whatever substance her opulent trap lacks.Latitude’s bookers mostly keep their kingdom as a pampered middle-class protectorate, but its saving grace is the Sunrise arena, with its army of unfeasibly discerning 14-year-olds. Their new obsession will be Octavian, a rasping, tragically soulful singer-rapper whose breakout hit, Party Here, perfectly leavens hurt with weightless euphoria. Even his unreleased anthems incite bedlam: during Lightning, most furiously clamour forward, others audibly gasp, a reaction usually reserved for fictional opera-goers. It’s that good, a breathtaking performance that amply compensates for flickers of festival complacency elsewhere."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/405252cdffb232f290e205f4dc94eede84e05dc6/0_0_3468_2080/master/3468.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a5e58d757ba11d64d8f41fe895df575","title":"andrew griffiths should resign as mp says local tory chair","story":"Head of women’s branch says MP for Burton should step down for sending lewd textsA former minister who sent sexually explicit text messages to two constituents should resign as an MP for his “absolutely deplorable” actions, the chair of the local Conservative women’s branch has said.Andrew Griffiths, the Conservative MP for Burton, whose wife gave birth to their first child 12 weeks ago, resigned as the minister for small business when his “depraved” text messages were printed in the Sunday Mirror at the weekend.Griffiths, 47, is accused of sending 2,000 messages including lewd comments in which he referred to himself as “Daddy” during exchanges with a 28-year-old barmaid.

He has so far refused to resign as an MP but on Monday several members of his local party, the East Staffordshire Conservatives, refused to give him their backing.

His attitude towards women is absolutely disgusting.”Beryl Toon, the Conservative borough councillor for Rolleston, in Griffiths’ constituency, said she had “strong feelings” on the matter but could not air them publicly. She did say, however, that there had been calls locally for Griffiths to resign. “People have actually said it to me,” she said. “Neighbours and Conservative members.”Heather Wheeler, the Conservative MP in neighbouring South Derbyshire, said it was “the right decision” for Griffiths to resign as a minister but he was an “excellent local MP and I know he will continue to be”.Conor Wileman, the chair of East Staffordshire Conservatives, announced Griffiths’ resignation “with great disappointment” in a message to members on Saturday night. Sharing Griffith’s own statement with party members, Wileman added: “I wanted to let our members read this statement before they saw it in the Sunday papers. I will be arranging a full members’ meeting in due course.“In the meantime we are working with CCHQ and supporting Andrew while he addresses his personal issues.”Patricia Ackroyd, a member of Griffith’s local Conservative party and a councillor on East Staffordshire borough council, said she did not want to comment on whether he should resign as MP but added: “The only thing I would say is I feel very sorry for Andrew and his family in these very difficult circumstances.”Other local party members said they supported Griffiths. Lynne Shelton, a Conservative councillor for Heath ward, said: “Private lives are exactly that. Andrew has always been very helpful to me as a councillor. When I’ve needed help he’s always given it to me. He was a big support when I was diagnosed with Parkinson’s. He’s always been respectful. I can’t comment on his private life because I don’t know anything about it.”Andrew Bridgen, the Conservative MP for neighbouring North West Leicestershire, said: “Andrew Griffiths’s position is a matter between him and his electorate in Burton upon Trent. But the voices on the left calling for him to resign as an MP would have more resonance if they weren’t the party supporting the continued membership in the Houses of Parliament of Keith Vaz. That’s the hypocrisy of the left, isn’t it?”Two years ago Vaz, the Labour MP for Leicester East, was caught by the Sunday Mirror using escorts while chairing an inquiry into vice laws. He was also accused of damaging parliament’s reputation after appearing to offer to pay for cocaine if it was brought to a future meeting. An investigation into Vaz’s behaviour by the parliamentary standards commissioner, triggered by Bridgen, is ongoing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31382ec8df1da3f99105ec58ff493505aabbea49/0_74_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=824f9d41d3645fe60c9c00637095515b","title":"theresa may ready cave in hardline brexiters customs demands","story":"PM accepts amendments to customs bill rather than allow Jacob Rees-Mogg to stage show of strengthTheresa May has caved in to hardline Brexiters over amendments to the customs bill, rather than allow Jacob Rees-Mogg and colleagues to stage a show of parliamentary strength.As the prime minister tried to sell her Chequers deal on Brexit to the public and her own backbenchers, the European Research Group (ERG) of pro-Brexit MPs tabled four amendments to the legislation last week.The ERG believes May’s “facilitated customs arrangement”, which would see the UK collect EU tariffs on some imports, and plans for a “common rulebook” for goods and agriculture, would allow for too close a future relationship with the EU27.Rees-Mogg held talks with the chief whip, Julian Smith, on Monday, and the government later signalled that it would accept all four amendments, avoiding an embarrassing clash with rebellious backbenchers.Tory remain rebels reacted with fury to the concessions. “It’s appalling. Utterly appalling. Jacob Rees-Mogg is running our country,” said one MP.Just hours earlier, Downing Street had suggested it had concerns about one of the four Brexit amendments in particular, which would prohibit HMRC from “collection of certain taxes or duties on behalf of territory without reciprocity” – a move aimed at blocking the facilitated customs arrangement.That appears to directly torpedo May’s plans for a “facilitated customs arrangement”, as set out in last week’s white paper.The other three amendments, including one making it illegal to establish a customs border in the Irish Sea, harden stated government policy into law.A Downing Street spokesman defended the Chequers deal on Monday, saying it was, “very clear that the proposal we put forward at Chequers delivers on the will of the people in the referendum”.“Cabinet is behind it, businesses have come out to support it and now we need to get on with negotiating with the EU,” the spokesman said.Scott Mann, the MP for North Cornwall, became the latest Conservative MP to resign a government post over the Chequers deal on Monday, in a rolling protest from concerned backbenchers.Mann, a parliamentary private secretary at the Treasury, said in his resignation letter: “Elements of the Brexit white paper will inevitably put me in direct conflict with the views expressed by a large section of my constituents.”The longest-serving health secretary - having held the role for almost six years - becomes foreign secretary after Boris Johnson\u0027s resignation.The former culture secretary replaces Hunt as health secretary.The former attorney general takes on Hancock’s old job as culture secretary.The Devon MP is promoted to be attorney general and will attend cabinet.The former housing minister is promoted to Brexit secretary after the resignation of David Davis.Goes to the backbenches after kicking off the ministerial reshuffle with his resignation as Brexit secretary over Theresa May\u0027s negotiation plans.The gaffe-prone and controversial foreign secretary joins Davis on the backbenches after also quitting his role.The prime minister was at Farnborough airshow on Monday morning, before heading back to Westminster to report to MPs on last week’s Nato summit.Fears are growing at Westminster that there is now no Brexit deal – not the Chequers plan, nor David Davis’s Canada-style trade deal, nor a no-deal scenario – that could command the backing of a majority of MPs.Had the ERG amendments been pushed to the vote, it would have given the government a sense of the likely rebellion it could face from hardliners, if it brings a soft Brexit deal to the Commons in the autumn.A senior Labour source expressed surprise the government had not postponed debate on the customs bill and another Brexit bill, the trade bill, when it announced planned parliamentary business at the end of last week, rather than face the risk of a series of embarrassing defeats.“They’re in a place where they don’t want votes that could look like a vote of confidence,” he said, adding: “The crunch might not come today but come the autumn there’s going to have to be a reckoning.”Meanwhile, the former education secretary Justine Greening has become the most senior Conservative to lend her backing to the idea of a referendum to allow the public to have a say on the proposed Brexit deals.Writing in the Times, the MP for Putney said the “only solution is to take the final Brexit decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians” by letting voters choose from three options: May’s final deal, a no-deal Brexit or staying in the EU.Dominic Grieve, a Tory remainer, gave reluctant backing to the prime minister’s negotiating strategy, arguing May was “doing her best to minimise the damage that flows from the decision to leave the European Union” and that her approach was a lot better than the alternative being promoted by the hard Brexiters.Writing in the Evening Standard, Grieve wrote that “in a deeply ided country we must either work together to get the best deal we can” and accept compromise, or the Tory right should accept that Brexit cannot be implemented."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/653d6b81c79d6f9b8976b72111afb6e8e486137e/0_158_4740_2844/master/4740.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f24a683dc12ffbc7e931991d88e8dcc9","title":"can you solve it head spinning bicycle puzzles","story":"Run your brain through the gearsAs we are almost midway through the Tour de France, I thought it would be a good moment for some bicycle puzzles.1) The King of the Mountains went up the col at 15 km an hour and down it at 45 km an hour.

Thankfully, things have changed Fifty years ago, I started a four-year degree in sociology and social work at Bath University, and reflecting on that time has made me appreciate the qualities of those now graduating and joining the profession.First, I am impressed by their commitment. I did not have to pay fees to do my degree, and I received a maintenance grant. With earnings from my summer job, this meant that, when I graduated, my only debt was the money I had borrowed from the bank to buy the car I needed to get to work. What a contrast with the financial position confronting most social work students today, who leave university with tens of thousands of pounds of debt.Second, today’s qualifying students are more competent and informed than I was when I started work in 1972, and there is a stronger focus on core skills to be used and developed throughout their careers through the social work professional capabilities framework. It starts with the assessment and relationship practice skills social workers need from day one and moves on to the leadership, training and more strategic planning roles they may take on later in their career. There was much less coherence when I was qualifying and initially practising about the required skills and knowledge.Third, the introduction of the Assessed and Supported Year in Employment requires newly qualifed social workers to embed their knowledge and skills in day-to-day practice. It is a demanding year of juggling a job with continuing learning and development and the requirement to produce a portfolio of evidence to show their growing practice competence. It is building strong practitioners. However, there still needs to be more focus on developing education and training for social workers as they change roles throughout their careers.Over the past eight years, I have been working with local authorities to improve children’s services that have been rated inadequate by Ofsted. Without exception, managers recognised the high quality of newly qualified social workers in children’s and adults’ services. Managers’ overwhelming impression was of their commitment and competence, although I am anxious for them – and for their more experienced colleagues – due to the huge workloads and the impact of the government’s austerity measures. For my first few years as a social worker, I did not have all the confidence or the patter to do the job as well as I would have wanted. Knocking on a door to initiate contact as a result of concerns about the welfare of a child sitting down with an older person who fears having to leave their home because living alone has become difficult accompanying a frightened teenager from a youth court to a children’s home and away from their parents for the first time assessing the safety and vulnerability of someone in the community having an acute psychotic crisis – all of these, and more, were part of my day-to-day work.But I did not initially have the experience to know how best to handle these challenges and it takes time – in my case two to three years – to build the necessary competence and confidence. So when I hear comments about students completing their degrees not being the complete professional social work practitioner, I recall what it was like for me. The people who make these comments – including senior managers and government advisers who have little idea about this demanding and distressing work – should be more realistic and less undermining.These newly qualified workers, committed, competent and growing in confidence, are the stars who will be the bright future of our profession.

First he soared. Then he hopped before, as the pain from a torn hamstring hit, dropping to his knees.It could have been a metaphor for the next 11 months of the sport: the thrill of the 2017 world championships, with its stadiums packed and 10 million watching Bolt’s and Mo Farah’s farewell, replaced by a slowing down and indifference from casual observers.Right now athletics feels like a sport fumbling uncertainly in the dark, trying to find a way to make the public care in the post-Bolt world. The Jamaican was not only its biggest weapon but its greatest crutch.And so to Saturday night in the Olympic Stadium, for the inaugural Athletics World Cup – a new and much-hyped eight-nation event. Once again as the first day drew to a close the British, American and Jamaican teams were squaring off in the 4x100m. Only this time the names were very different.None of the British team who set a national record of 37.47 to take gold at last year’s world championships was there. Nor was any of the Americans who finished second or, indeed, the Jamaicans. In fact none of Britain’s 10 fastest 100m runners was competing – with the team led out by Reuben Arthur, who has the 23rd-fastest time in the UK in 2018.Does this matter? You might think so. After all the British Athletics chief executive, Niels de Vos, had promised that the overall quality would be “astonishing”. But many of Britain’s stars, including Dina Asher-Smith, Laura Muir and Reece Prescod, were missing – along with many other marquee names including Caster Semenya and American sprinter Noah Lyles, fastest man in the world this year.Imagine having a World Cup with no Ronaldo, Neymar and Messi, and with Jermain Defoe up front for England. It wouldn’t fly, would it?And yet British Athletics would argue – with some justification – that filling more than half of the London Stadium on a Saturday when England’s footballers and cricketers were in action, as well as the Wimbledon women’s singles final, was a decent first stab. Sunday had fewer fans, but they still enjoyed seeing the US team run away with the trophy and the sight of a makeshift British team battling to third.Perhaps there is something to the idea of team competition. After all, racing’s Shergar Cup does not attract the best horses yet its team-based event attracts big crowds to Ascot. Certainly those in the stadium seem to enjoy the action. A friend of mine who had spent £70 on his ticket seemed happy enough for a one-off – although he admitted the athletics was “far from world-class”.That seemed to sum up the general mood. Reasonably entertaining, interesting format, quality and TV coverage leaving a lot to be desired.But the final judgment needs to wait: until UK Athletics’ balance sheet has been properly assessed and scrutinised, until after the impact on the crowd for this week’s Anniversary Games is known, and – in the longer term – on whether it brings new fans to the sport. Ultimately it also needs to create a genuine legacy. There is talk of China being interested in hosting in 2020. But how many stars will be tempted to turn up in an Olympic year?We can certainly say there were far too many teething problems. Why was the competition announced after athletes had signed kit deals for 2018 – often meaning their priority was elsewhere? And why did some kit manufacturers, whose sponsorship provides athletes with the majority of their income, only find about the event in the newspapers?There is a potential parallel here with Nitro Athletics, a new competition launched with great fanfare in Australia in 2017 with the help of Bolt. The media coverage was extensive. The crowds decent. There was talk of it saving the sport, despite warnings that people were simply coming to tick seeing Bolt off their bucket list.And in its first year Nitro – which was run as a subsidiary company of Athletics Australia – lost $1.826m (£1.02m). The event was not held in 2018 and its future is uncertain.I hope the Athletics World Cup has a rosier future, for track and field needs a shot in the arm. There are some diehard fans who insist this is only a minor post-Bolt lull, and the sport has had similar wobbles before. That is not the sense I get from speaking to athletes, administrators and agents. Appearance fees are down. TV coverage is shrinking. And they fear sports such as MMA are more appealing to younger audiences.One influential voice told me last week that athletics was in danger of becoming a sport people care about only once every four years during the Olympics. While Greg Rutherford warned recently: “It’s probably a sign of the times that more people want to talk to me about Strictly Come Dancing. Can you imagine that happening in the era of Seb Coe and Steve Ovett, or even Sally Gunnell and Linford Christie? Now nobody cares about athletics.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6116ae2e76d71db6ca933b4c9ceb79a2826bd179/306_131_1460_876/master/1460.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eb12e1c0649eb81416496ce59cccdc0","title":"england india odi decider world cup mark wood","story":"Mark Wood says England will use the deciding match of the one-day series against India as a dress rehearsal for a potential knockout match when they host next year’s World Cup.It will be highly instructive then to see how they cope under pressure and encumbered by a major injury blow after the opener Jason Roy was rated just a “30-70” chance to recover from the lacerated little finger on his right hand sustained fielding in his side’s series-levelling victory at Lord’s on Saturday.Roy’s misfortune, and the pessimistic prognosis given to him by England suggests he is almost certain to miss out, hands an unexpected opportunity to James Vince just two months after he was jettisoned from England’s Test squad.The Hampshire batsman became surplus to requirements following a disappointing winter in Australia and New Zealand when his weakness outside off stump was brutally exposed.But after decent 50-over form for his county, including a knock of 171 in last month’s Royal London One-Day Cup semi-final against Yorkshire, Vince was called into England’s one-day squad as cover once Dawid Malan, himself an injury replacement for Alex Hales, was commandeered by England Lions on Sunday.Now Roy’s injury means Vince is on the verge of winning his sixth ODI cap, and first since October 2016, when this series against India, currently deadlocked at 1-1, concludes at Headingley on Tuesday.Sam Billings, who was called up as further batting cover late on Monday, appears the only barrier to that happening.Billings’ last ODI appearance came in the defeat against Scotland in Edinburgh last month but he appears behind Vince given the vacant slot would be as an opener, not his preferred role, and he has been parachuted into the squad at such a late stage.The absence of Roy, who has 416 ODI runs at an average of 52 this summer, is a setback for England as they seek to win their eighth 50-over series in succession.Wood, though, insists the winner-takes-all nature of this match will offer Eoin Morgan’s team invaluable preparation ahead of next year’s World Cup.England won their last one-day series decider against New Zealand in Christchurch in March and, as the world’s No 1 ranked team, are favourites to do so again in Leeds.Asked if this match might have an impact on the five-Test series between England and India to come this summer, Wood said: “I think for the Test-match side of things, it is great to get certain people out or get runs against them but it is more of an impact for the World Cup.“If we can treat this game as a semi-final, a must win with the pressure on, we can learn what we are doing wrong if we don’t win or what we are doing right if we do. Over the past year we have dealt with these situations well and hopefully we can carry on that trend tomorrow.Big games require big players to come to the fore and for Ben Stokes, the most expensive overseas signing in Indian Premier League history, Headingley offers a stage for the all-rounder to show he is completely over the torn hamstring he sustained in May.Stokes returned for the T20 series decider against India in Bristol this month, but has so far failed to take a wicket in three matches and his only significant score with the bat came in the opening ODI at Trent Bridge last week when he scored the slowest 50-over half-century for England in 13 years.However, Wood believes his Durham teammate is close to his best.“I think it’s a chance for Ben to prove how good he is again,” he said. “He doesn’t need to – everyone knows how good a player he is but obviously coming back from a bit of time out he’s probably desperate to do well and be that match-winner again.“It takes a bit of time to get your form and your rhythm back so I’m sure the more he plays the better he’ll get. India are a quality team so maybe they’ll have a game plan for him and it might just take him a little bit of time to work out certain situations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dbc7a6fc2f1611a66b5aae56605740e68ad6474/849_0_4363_2618/master/4363.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=442ba8e2de3bdba2a0619f9629be15f5","title":"mark cavendish tour de france stage wins record eddy merckx","story":"As he made it to the finish line in Roubaix on Sunday, the 52nd rider to come home on a day of bone-rattling cobbles and throat-clogging dust, Mark Cavendish would have been looking forward to a rest day. The first week of the 2018 Tour de France was harsh on a man who, chasing the all-time record of stage wins, had started the season with a series of bad crashes. The signs have not been promising for one of the most remarkable British sporting figures of our lifetime.The four victories that would bring him level with Eddy Merckx’s 34 are now out of reach for this year, at least. After a 500-mile transfer to the first rest day in Annecy, three days in the high mountains come before his next chance of a win, at the end of Friday’s flat stage from Bourg d’Oisans to Valence. Two more opportunities then present themselves, in Pau on stage 18 and in Paris on the final day.Paris would be a good one to win, of course. It would bring back memories of his four consecutive triumphs on the Champs-Elysées, none more resplendent than 2012, when he wore the world champion’s rainbow jersey and was led into the final kilometre by his yellow-clad teammate Bradley Wiggins. For British cycling, that seemed like the day of days.So the record will have to wait until next year at least, and there are plenty of people ready to venture the opinion that the Manxman has missed his opportunity. Cavendish himself appeared to give them support when he was asked before this year’s Grand Départ whether he still commanded the same power that was at his disposal in the years when we was winning four, five and even six stages in a single Tour. His reply was typically blunt. “No,” he said. “I’m 33 years old and I’ve got four kids at home.”Others believe that his age has yet to assume a real relevance.Clearly his power and endurance are sufficient to carry him to the end of a stage in the leading group. His instinct for the right place to be in the hectic scuffle of the closing showdown is unlikely to have deserted him.What might be more relevant is the second part of his statement. The “four kids at home” are, as this emotional man has often said, the light of his life. They include a baby son, born in May, whom he has hardly seen, thanks to his pre-Tour training regime. The writer Cyril Connolly once warned that the pram in the hallway was the enemy of promise, while Enzo Ferrari believed that marriage slowed his drivers down by iding their concentration. While neither view might stand up to serious examination, there could be occasions when it rings true.Cavendish’s devotion to his sport at all levels is beyond question. But sprinting is a matter of fine margins, both physical and mental, and a father of four would probably not be quite as keen to expose himself to the kind of risk that led to his collision with Peter Sagan a year ago, for which the Slovak was disqualified from the Tour. The crash ended Cavendish’s race with a shoulder injury which, he told my colleague William Fotheringham recently, has permanently affected the way he rides.“Gone are the days when I got angry,” he also said during the same interview, but there have been one or two signs of the sparks that once lit the bonfire of his competitive ferocity. At the end of Friday’s stage in Chartres his temper flared briefly when he accused journalists of concentrating on his own “choppy” riding rather than that of others. But he also conceded that, although his power meter had been giving encouraging messages, he was not able to match the speed of those ahead of him, led by Dylan Groenewegen, a 25-year-old Dutchman.A day later he might have had a rueful chuckle when he found himself elevated from 10th to eighth place in Amiens following the relegation of two of his direct rivals. André Greipel and Fernando Gaviria had displeased the commissaires when they came together in the final 300 metres while trying in vain to prevent Groenewegen from taking his second stage in a row. Once upon a time it would have been Cavendish in the thick of such an elbows-out, helmet-banging alpha-sprinter tussle.He may have seen the writing on the wall during his last season with Quick-Step in 2015, when Gaviria, then aged 20, arrived from Colombia and showed himself to be the obvious candidate to become the team’s next star sprinter. Two wins over Cavendish in the early-season Tour de San Luis prompted the former world champion to strike back and beat the young pretender in the final stage, but the long-term message was not hard to decipher.No longer does he have the best team around him, as was usually the case in his days with Highroad, Team Sky and Quick-Step. At Dimension Data he can count on the presence of Mark Renshaw, his long-time pilot fish, but Bernie Eisel, the brains and engine of his most effective lead-out trains, is still recovering from brain surgery following an accident during a race in March.And, of course, they are all getting older, even the man whose precocious virtuosity once led a writer for L’Equipe to call him the Mozart of the 11-tooth sprocket. Perhaps more victories lie ahead.If not then we have been fortunate to watch him, and to call him ours."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c35500304b1f6337ca4d2eeb55f8fb9039cab6f3/157_112_2371_1423/master/2371.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b73f1434e31e04c2d6ff85fca897e4e","title":"rfl 2m losses over 300000 nigel wood","story":"The former chief executive of the Rugby Football League Nigel Wood will be paid more than £300,000 as part of his severance package from the game’s governing body – almost a sixth of the total losses of more than £2m which the RFL incurred last year.The RFL will publicise its 2017 accounts after all 38 professional clubs have attended the sport’s annual general meeting this month, but the  has seen details which reveal the significance of Wood’s exit payment after agreeing to step down as CEO.Listed in the directors’ remuneration section of the accounts is confirmation that Wood received a provision for loss of office totalling £328,840. The majority of that sum will be paid this year, though it is included in the RFL’s accounts for last year after the decision was made to part company in advance of the year end.Detailing the extent of the remaining payment, the accounts state: “Further to the agreements made between N Wood and the Board in 2017, N Wood left the RFL on 31012018. An agreement was made that N Wood would receive £288,963 in 2018. This amount has been accrued in the 2017 accounts to be paid in 2018.” Wood has already received the remainder of the sum.The accounts also reveal that all the RFL’s non-executive directors – including the former Football Association chief executive Brian Barwick – received wage increases in 2017.

She opens up about shame, rage, her autism diagnosis and the meaning of Louis CKDuring the live run of Hannah Gadsby’s standup show, Nanette, she found herself sleeping 15 hours a night, then taking naps during the day. “I got bronchitis in London,” she says. “A tooth wrenched out in Edinburgh. Then I got carbon monoxide poisoning from the flat in New York. I was Googling ‘neurological disorders’, I had the tremors and my speech was slurring. I kept telling people I was really tired, texting them coffin emojis, and they’d say: ‘Of course you are, this show is exhausting.’”But she doesn’t think you should really suffer for your art. Well, not any more. “I’m against that theory,” she says firmly.She performed Nanette for 18 months – including a one-month stint in New York that turned into four – and has now become accustomed to people expressing concern for her wellbeing.We meet in a crowded Melbourne cafe, and when another journalist, early for her slot, walks by, she puts a gentle hand on Gadsby’s shoulder, unbidden. Gadsby takes this in her stride. “I’ve had psychiatrists reach out to me, saying: ‘You know, there’s no precedent for what you’re doing.’ It’s been a strange old ride and I think it’s going to take a long time before I know what I’ve done to myself.”Gadsby is keen to go incognito. The easiest way to spot her is that she is the only person in the cafe hiding their face with their hand. But anonymity may no longer be possible. Nanette went up on Netflix a month ago, and has since elicited thorough analysis in the New Yorker, the Atlantic, the Washington Post and Vanity Fair, while Lily Allen, Thandie Newton, Monica Lewinsky, Ellen Page and Roxane Gay have raved andor wept about it on Twitter (in a tweet to Gadsby, Gay wrote: “You moved me and have really made me think about humour, the self, self-deprecation and the uses of anger”). Across Gadsby’s social networks, the general public also gives effusive thanks. Nanette is not merely an hour of standup. It’s a mass bloodletting.Gadsby can’t bring herself to look right now. In fact, she has asked her manager to mute any exciting offers. “I’m living somebody else’s dream,” she says. “Now everyone wants a piece of the Gads.”Standup comedy relies, of course, on creating tension and release. In Nanette, Gadsby exposes and then destroys that formula. She reveals experiences of homophobic and sexual violence, which escalate throughout the set, until finally she is delivering them from a precipice of rage. “This tension is yours,” she tells the stunned Sydney Opera House audience. “I am not helping you with it any more. You need to learn what this feels like.”“I broke the contract and that’s what made this work,” she says. “I betrayed people’s trust, and I did that really seriously, not just for effect.”Nanette debuted at the Melbourne International Comedy festival in 2017, the year of Australia’s same-sex marriage postal plebiscite, and during fierce debate around the Safe Schools programme designed to support LGBTQI students. Homophobia was making its way back into the public sphere a clear, disturbing regression.In the first third of Nanette, Gadsby deconstructs the autobiographical material she has aired over the years, including a tale about nearly getting beaten up at a bus stop, which gets the audience laughing gamely. In the second, she deconstructs comedy itself, and announces her intention to quit the circuit. To use self-deprecating humour when you are already deemed worthless, she suggests, is further humiliation. In the final third, she deconstructs misogyny, including her own internalised misogyny. She had never told the full story of the bus-stop incident, for example – that the man had come back and beaten her up, that nobody had stopped him, and that she didn’t go either to the police or the hospital afterwards, because she didn’t think she was worth it. Gadsby desperately needed to hear stories like hers when she was younger, but instead had been complicit in silencing them. No more.Gadsby grew up in small-town, bible-belt Tasmania. Homosexuality was a crime there until 1997, so – she says jovially in her set – the likes of her were supposed to “pack up your Aids in a suitcase and fuck off to Mardi Gras”. But the island state is also the butt of incest jokes from mainland Australia, so she felt instinctively protective of it. It is not the only time she has found that loyalty can be at the expense of the self at the end of Nanette she reveals painfully, briefly, that she was sexually abused as a child and raped as a young woman, but doesn’t go into details. How that silence – within a show about breaking silence – must sting.“It’s this murky area where you know the people and it has repercussions for their families,” she says, “so I don’t know how to put that out there in the world in a constructive and safe way for both me and all involved. We only have an existing narrative framework for a stranger doing violence to you.”The idea of “stranger danger” persists in the collective psyche, but we now know that sexual offences against children are the crimes least likely to involve strangers. Most children will be abused by opportunists in adult relationships: the married relatives, the family friends, the pillars of the community, the good blokes. “A lot of people who have experienced trauma at the hands of people they’ve trusted take responsibility, and that is what’s toxic,” Gadsby says. “It’s bullshit that as a kid I’d care for a person that was abusing me, but you just do and that’s the horrific thing.”Shame and rage are the twin forces behind Nanette, but rage, at least, has velocity. It is purposeful, powering her to the final third, whereas shame welds the feet to the ground. Gadsby considers this delineation. “Shame has its place,” she says. “Shame is what you do to a kid to stop them running on the road. And then you take the shame away and immediately they’re back in the fold. You should never soak anybody in shame. It’s the prolonged existence of shame that then flips out into destructive rage. We can’t exist in that. It’s like treacle.”More remote support has come from fellow comedians many see Nanette as a game-changer (it was the joint winner of best show at last year’s Edinburgh fringe festival). “I’ve been a professional comic for 30 years,” tweeted Kathy Griffin. “I’ve been studying comedy for even longer. I thought I had seen everything …” Kristen Schaal advised her followers there was nothing better and more important than Nanette. Writing for New York magazine’s Vulture blog, Sara Schaefer and Sabrina Jalees discussed How Nanette Will Change Standup.The burden of talking about complex issues usually comes down to the most marginalised people. On the rare occasions that a white, heterosexual man steps up – Louis CK pointing out, for example, that “there is no greater threat to women than men” – they are hailed as heroes.Louis CK’s predilection for talking about masturbation in his sets became a metaphor in Gadsby’s mind for the rudimentary question-answer setup of punchline jokes – “like rubbing one out” – and made her determined to pursue more sophisticated narratives. “A joke is a wank, but a story is intimacy,” she says.Before getting into comedy, Gadsby drifted, taking a variety of jobs across different states, from planting trees to cinema projectionist – surely the introvert’s dream vocation. At one point, she was homeless. It wasn’t until she was in her late 20s, around 2006, that she tried her hand at comedy, and she credits the newfound creativity with saving her life. “Comedy is great in that it’s accessible to someone like me, from a low socioeconomic background, struggling in life. The gatekeepers are a lot stronger in other art forms.”The darker side is that a comedy scene can harbour personalities that might be expunged from other professions. In Melbourne in June, a young female comedian, Eurydice Dixon, was murdered by a man who followed her home from the club where she had just performed. A week before our interview, a male comedian called Andy Nolch was charged with defacing the site where people had left floral tributes by painting a giant penis. The attention Dixon’s death had received, he said, was part of the media’s anti-men agenda.“He’s obviously an unwell kid and there’s a lot of that in comedy,” says Gadsby. “It’s often young men trialling their philosophies on life, and we’ve got a generation of young men who believe that they are victimised, because they’ve been promised the world. That’s a poisoned chalice, because now there’s a gap between what the cultural narrative is and what their experience is. Looking back, I think it’s done me more good than harm to be promised absolutely nothing. I was always told I didn’t matter to the world, but the world still matters to me. That’s why I haven’t responded to the more brutal aspects of my life with violence or bitterness.”Gadsby is happy to be back home in Ascot Vale, the neighbouring suburb to Moonee Ponds, made famous by Dame Edna Everage. She lives a stone’s throw from her brother’s fruit-and-veg shop. Life is simple. There are her dogs and her Royal Enfield motorcycle, and she is a keen gardener. “If a documentary crew were to follow me around, they’d probably think they were making a film about the saddest person in the world,” Gadsby says, “but I’m throwing the best thought orgies.”Three years ago, she was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. “It’s clarified why the comedy lifestyle is so difficult for me,” she says. “It’s a lot of noise and moving around.” A child wails, as if on cue, and she flinches.Gadsby explains that people with autism have an increased sensitivity to traumatisation due to their difficulty in communicating and regulating emotions. They are also more vulnerable to becoming victims in the first place. A Swedish study this year revealed that women who screened positive for autism are nearly three times more likely to have experienced sexual abuse.When the Australian TV celebrity Don Burke was at the centre of #MeToo allegations last year, he blamed autism for his actions – and Gadsby took aim on social media. “If there’s one thing that a spectrum brain is great at, it is identifying patterns,” she wrote. “So let me show you a fascinating pattern that I have noticed recently: Don Burke told us he had Asperger’s under the very same circumstances that Kevin Spacey came out of the closet, which is exactly the same kind of moment that Harvey Weinstein reframed himself as sex addict, and when Louis CK chose to acknowledge his peculiar special needs clause.”Now, she points out that Nanette was built from her ability to see patterns. “Having the framework of autism boils down to not looking out to the world to see how I should exist, but knowing I don’t actually have to be social, knowing that it exhausts me and that I will get confused and look like an idiot,” she says. “Because I also know that I understand things a lot deeper than a lot of people.”Everyone wants to know what’s next on the agenda for the Gads. Most immediately, she will be putting out her memoir, 10 Steps to Nanette, and it would surely be foolish not to capitalise on the rapturous interest in the US. “I’d never tried to crack the States because I’m not a hustler,” she says, with a modest smile. “Or an arsehole.”Doubters may question Gadsby’s declaration in Nanette that she is quitting comedy. More accurately, she is quitting comedy as she knew it. “I thought doing this show would mean I’d have to quit because the form was not enough for me any more,” she says, “but perhaps I’ve tapped into something a lot of people have begun to think. Perhaps standup is something I do, but it doesn’t have to be standup comedy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/488383c61f48c05adfe2f470226652f0fa98b801/0_153_4928_2958/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1f5b68cb01716ed33844351658fd9f2","title":"macbook pro keyboard update fix dust issues","story":" Teardown exposes new silicone skirt around keys that could stop debris from blocking them Despite Apple stating that new 2018 MacBook Pro keyboards were not designed to alleviate key failures due to dust, a teardown has revealed a new barrier under the keys that could stop them getting clogged up.Repair specialists iFixit took apart one of the keyboards of the new £1,749-plus laptops to see what had been changed for what Apple calls its new third-generation butterfly mechanism under the keys that is reportedly quieter in operation.What iFixit discovered was a new silicone membrane that surrounds the mechanism under each key. This muffles some of the click sound when the key is depressed, but may also prevent dust and debris from getting underneath the keys and blocking the key mechanism.The company recently applied for a patent for a system for “ingress prevention for keyboards” designed to block dust and debris from getting under keys that closely resembles the silicone barrier found under the new keyboard keys.Apple has publicly said that the third-generation MacBook Pro keyboard was not designed with dust in mind, but it has recently admitted that, at least in some circumstances, users can have issues with debris rendering keys inoperable.Facing lawsuits and customer complaints, Apple recently rolled out an extended repair programme that will repair laptops that have stuck keys free of charge. The programme covers the new MacBook and MacBook Pros released in 2015 onwards, for a period of four years from the date of purchase.The repair firm said that it would test the ingress protection to see if the barriers blocked dust from causing dead keys.Apple did not reply to a request for comment ahead of publication."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c66f62526c41c2171c47e4e5f6c091cec698298/52_0_1300_780/master/1300.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c12169fae38e378ccef7330e935856cb","title":"who is america sacha baron cohen new show","story":"The first episode of the comedian’s much-hyped new series has one moment of viral gold but is mostly a frustrating experience Somewhere around the bit in which Sacha Baron Cohen recalls being cuckolded by a dolphin while on vacation with his (human) wife, a viewer is liable to be hit with a wave of nostalgia. Sitting through the largely tiresome pilot of Baron Cohen’s latest program Who Is America? inspires longing for a simpler past, when Baron Cohen’s profile was still low enough that he didn’t have to mask his face with nightmare-inducing prosthetics just to go incognito. He plays four characters in the first episode of this new series – an obese quack doctor, an NPR-listening uberliberal, a limey ex-con and a gruff Israeli commando – all of whom evoke fonder memories of sweet Borat, the good-natured traveler in thrall of a “very nice” world full of “great success!” As hardliners on the left and right, gun nuts and bleeding-heart activists, confrontation is baked into the very premise of this new quartet.But the real nostalgia is for Borat’s era, the comparatively low-stakes idyll of the Bush administration’s tail end. Baron Cohen is now returning to a form he popularized during a time marked by a different set of notions about how comedy best functions, and a different viewership to receive it. For Borat, wannabe rudeboy Ali G, and flamboyant talk show host Brüno, George W Bush was the perfect bad president, an ideal target. He was just incompetent enough to provide endless fodder for mockery, and yet not so calamitously harmful that there would be no fun in making fun. And the people proud to identify themselves as living in Bush’s America revealed the psychosis under heartland values, as gleefully racist as they were hospitable. Baron Cohen was looked on as a daring subversive for turning politeness against his unwitting victims, feeding them the rope by which they could then happily hang themselves. (His “throw the Jew down the well” segment remains surreal, hysterically funny, and deeply disturbing.)Much has transpired since then, and Baron Cohen knows it. He’s unabashedly political in his aspirations for this program, attempting to define an American identity by interviewing its wild and woolly citizens. The implication here, as with all comedy that dares to skew political in the year 2018, is that this is urgent work for an urgent moment. Early threats of legal action from such well-known reprobates as Joe Arpaio and Roy Moore promised cathartic comeuppance after watching these slimy characters take every page of the circumlocution playbook on news programs trying their best to remain decorous, the public would get the chance to watch them go up against someone who didn’t have professional scruples getting in the way of his hate.And when he does, by god, it works. Baron Cohen saves the clear standout segment of the first episode for last, in which, with minimal difficulty, he convinces a handful of congressmen to support a bill arming four-year-olds with firearms. It will go down as one of the more effective works of Trump-era satire, as damning and chilling and disarmingly strange as the latest tweet from the commander-in-chief. The sight of a geriatric man brandishing a semiautomatic rifle outfitted with cute bunny-rabbit ears will not leave the memory of those who gaze upon it any time soon.With Baron Cohen going out of his way to position Who Is America? in a fractious and chaotic nation beset by families torn asunder, militarized forces suppressing protests, and lives lost, he sets the bar extremely high for himself. When he manages to clear it, the results are dazzling (the final segment has already become viral gold on Twitter), but anything less feels like a waste of time. The woods are burning, and he gives us poop jokes? The line on Baron Cohen was initially that he may be too dangerous for the US, a country that loves nothing more than getting worked up over incendiary comedy gunning for that exact reaction. Odd, fascistic twists of fate have reversed the situation, however. After a sojourn in the unforgiving wilds of feature acting, Baron Cohen returns to the American mainstream to find that it has grown too dangerous for him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b015d601343fdf3926052c994e673351e351794/0_538_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00c7899364fa2bcd48a476aa83103099","title":"what did the doctor who trailer tell us","story":"Bradley Walsh reading the Beano, Alan Shearer talking about football, pizzas mysteriously reanimating – the quick-fire Who trailer wasn’t long but it did give us something to chew onIt’s been BBC convention for a while now to give away big Doctor Who news in the middle of massive sporting events. Pearl Mackie’s casting announcement as Bill was revealed in the middle of the Euro 2016 final and Jodie Whittaker’s unveiling came at the climax of last year’s Wimbledon. So it’s great to see that Auntie still has enough faith in its biggest property to give the same platform to the new era of Doctor Who, with a brand new trailer shown halfway through the World Cup final. And yet I feel undernourished?Just about the only thing we can be totally sure of is that this new gang of the Doctor’s “friends” – as the publicity material carefully puts it (no longer “companions”, certainly not the reductive “assistants”) - don’t have very healthy diets. Doctor Thirteen will lead a somewhat crowded Tardis of four made up of: near-national cheeky chappie treasure Bradley Walsh neglecting The Chase as Graham, and talented Hollyoaks alumni Mandip Gill as Yasmin and Tosin Cole as Ryan. The micro-trailer introduces the trio in a scene that features florid World Cup commentary and various food items being transformed seemingly because Whittaker’s new Doctor is incoming. Ryan is seen tucking into a Full English. Yasmin takes delivery of a deep-dish pizza, while Graham is seeing eyeing up battered sausages in the chippy. Suddenly, the flashes in space-time seem to improve their lots in life just a bit just as the Doctor approaches their various locations, and meals, get a cosmic upgrade. When the time came, at half-time during the France v Croatia final, Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer could not have looked less interested during their forced intro to the clip. A little more enthusiasm came with the radio dialogue from the BBC team throughout. “The first touch was out of this world,” gushed Shearer. Rio Ferdinand added: “They’ve got the makings of a really strong team. They’ve got great energy, they’ve got great flair. I’m really excited to see what happens.”Amid all this the main emotion I’m feeling is frustration about how little was on offer. No dialogue, no interaction, certainly no monsters. But what more were we to expect from an early trailer for a series not expected to screen until October? In this case though, perhaps, a little more. A minor scandal recently saw a scene leak online from an unnamed source which delivered a bit of real Tardis-team action. Who-watchers suggested producers may be opening the flap after the cat had already bolted and, perhaps optimistically, called for a proper look rather than just a teaser. The brief glimpse did remind me of Tennant’s tenure in the Tardis, a bit more down to earth, a bit less serious. Incoming showrunner Chris Chibnall’s predecessor Steven Moffat delighted in casting the Doctor as out of the ordinary. Matt Smith played the character as a manic imp, while Peter Capaldi managed to emote all of the Doctor’s history with the slightest of tweaks to the crumples on his face. It’s far too soon to judge Whittaker on the basis of seconds of footage: all we’ve seen her do so far is smile. Tennant regularly tops best ever Doctor polls, so maybe a more relatable Doctor is just what’s needed, and Whittaker’s take could provide just that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031c97edaacca795957c1ddc4e94480475a5b3e4/0_312_961_576/master/961.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e882ce50d40e601b7cf456ed680289c","title":"what its like when ice detains you they own you youre impotent","story":"I spent 11 months in US immigration detention. Here’s what happenedIt was a regular Sunday when they arrested me. I’d just gotten paid – back then I was working in the fields, picking grapes – and the kids decided they wanted to go to Ihop for breakfast.We got in the car and my oldest daughter, Jennifer, was driving and joking around, and we were all laughing. She was just being so silly. We got to the restaurant, the little ones ordered pancakes, and Jennifer and I had omelettes. We finished and got back in the car.That’s when they came. I don’t know where they had been hiding, but suddenly there were seven Ice officers, all in uniform. I don’t know how they found me, but they thought I was driving the car. One of them started knocking on the driver’s side window and asking Jennifer: Are you Floricel Liborio Ramos?One officer, he spoke Spanish. He said: You have to get out of the car and answer some questions. Then he said: Sorry, but we’ll be taking you in, and the kids will be staying here. Is there anyone who can come and get them?I had to phone my friend who was miles away. She asked me if I was allowed to wait for her to arrive – after all, the youngest kids were only 10 and 12. The officer said no, they had to take me right now. Ihop is always busy on a Sunday. There was a line of people waiting to eat and they were all standing there watching as the commotion happened. One officer told me I was going to go through deportation, that I couldn’t see a judge. I cried out: I have a life here! I have three kids who live here! They’re citizens!They put me in handcuffs in front of my kids and put me in the back of a car. I looked at my children’s faces. All I felt was sadness.I kept eye contact with them until the car started moving. Then I sat in the back, alone. The ride was silent.I came to the United States from Mexico in 1998, when I was 18. I come from a humble background, five brothers and sisters, from an indigenous family. I always wanted to help my parents out, but nobody would give me work in Mexico, so I decided to cross the border. I went first to Los Angeles, then I went to San Jose.Once I was there, I got my chance – two jobs, working six days a week at each of them. I worked at McDonald’s, starting a shift at 5am and getting out at 2pm, then I went to work in a taqueria from 5pm until 11 or 12 at night. It was really tiring and stressful. The work had to be done really quickly, and one of my jobs was washing the dishes, so I would get home and my clothes would be dirty and damp, but I would just fall asleep sitting down on the sofa. But when I got my paycheck I’d feel so pleased, because at least I knew my parents would have something to eat.That was when I met my children’s dad. He worked at the taqueria and was an undocumented immigrant from Mexico too. I would get out really late, and when I’d leave at midnight he would give me a ride home. We started hanging out, and then it turned into a relationship. He was deported in 2012 – one day he left for work and didn’t come back. The kids still talk to him, but he’s not really part of our lives any more.One Monday in the detention facility, an officer walked around and called out names. There were nine of us. We were told we’d have to get up at 3am because we were going to be taken away. This feeling of fear came over me – normally they would only take people out at that time of night when they were going to be deported. They said: No, you’re actually going to be transferred. The facility had gotten too full.They drove us to Gilroy and put us in a small van to transfer us to the next place. By this time it was hot outside, over 100 degrees, and there were too many people to fit inside. We were squeezed in, shackled at the wrists, the waist, the ankles. There was no air conditioning, and it was even hotter inside the van than it was outside. It was like getting in a furnace everything was so dark. I felt like I was choking.That’s when the chaos started. One woman was older, she had diabetes, she started feeling dizzy and throwing up. Another lady was claustrophobic, and she started screaming and tearing off her clothes. We hadn’t had anything to eat, and they didn’t give us any water – all we needed was just a single drop of water – and we were all still chained up, handcuffed, our clothes drenched in sweat, banging on the grill shouting, saying, We can’t breathe! Then one woman just passed out. We couldn’t tell if she was alive or dead. We started telling the driver, Please! Stop! Somebody’s unconscious! I couldn’t breathe any more. I thought I was never going to see my kids again. But he didn’t stop the van, he just told us to shut up. He just sat there, driving and texting on his phone. I think we’re only alive by a miracle.Sometimes I thought it was going to be my last night in the cell. I’d be mentally prepared, I’d go to see the judge, optimistic that something would happen. Then it wouldn’t, and I’d leave feeling even worse, because we had nothing concrete. But the worst thing was that I couldn’t be there when my kids needed me. All of their birthdays, Thanksgiving, Christmas. Those were the days I would just cry and cry. I worked cleaning the toilets for a dollar a day – nobody else would do it, but that dollar was money I could use to make a phone call to speak to my children. One minute costs 10 cents. When I called them I was desperate to have a long conversation, but I couldn’t afford it. They’d say: When are you coming home? We’ve been alone for a long time now, what’s happening? I’d try and dodge the questions, tell them to be good and to stay out of trouble. Daisy, my youngest daughter, would just cry. My heart was broken. Then the phone would just go dead, and I’d have to borrow minutes from someone else because I couldn’t let the conversation end like that. When you are detained, you don’t see the daylight. You’re stuck in the process. When they would take us to a court appearance, they would chain us up: at the hands, the waist, the ankles. In reality, we were only being taken to a different room in the detention center – we would only ever talk to the judge by video link. But we’d be shackled the whole time.They never gave me an interpreter at court hearings, so I would try and understand what the judge was saying by looking at her face. I used to see how she would talk to other people she would act much more patient with some of them than others. For me, her body, her behavior … they were very harsh. I would see the reactions on her face, it heightened my fears.To them, I was a single mother who had started using alcohol. I’d never drunk a drop before, but I was having problems sleeping because of anxiety – and after a long shift one of my co-workers offered me a beer. I started drinking to help me sleep, and that’s when I got a DUI. I know I made mistakes, but I’d taken parenting classes. I’d done a rehab program. I wasn’t drinking any more. But in court they would say I had no right to be free because I was a danger to society. They’d say: Imagine what could happen if she was released and then went and killed someone. It really darkened my feelings. I used to think: Am I a risk to society?I never really slept for a whole night while I was there. When it was hot at night, the officers would turn off the air conditioning. The mattresses were made out of plastic, and they would get so hot. So we used to clean the floor with our sanitary towels and then sleep on the floor because it was made of concrete, and so it was colder. I felt like I was choking.There were a lot of nightmares that something would happen to my kids. I’d wake up at three in the morning, the anxiety running through my head. I would close my eyes and think I was about to fall asleep and then the nightmares would start again. Sometimes I’d dream that I’d been released and then open my eyes and all I’d see is the wall and I’d realize that I was still in detention.They would let you have a paper and pen in your cell, so I kept a journal. It helped to write my experiences and feelings down. But the trauma is never going to go away. One day, when I feel ready, I want to sit down with a coffee and go through it and read it over. I’m not ready yet.One day, after 11 months in detention, they put on the shackles, put me in a van, and drove me to the detention facility in San Francisco. I was taken into a room and they started giving me documents to sign. You’re about to be released, they said. Who are you calling? Does your lawyer know?I was afraid. I thought: If I answer these questions wrong, maybe they’ll send me back. I couldn’t believe them. But then they took off the shackles, led me out through this huge door, pushed me out, closed it, and just left me there in the street.I saw this Mexican man walking by slowly, he looked so happy, I could see him just enjoying his liberty. I was thinking: Does anyone know about me? It was only when I saw my lawyer coming down the street, when I was able to hug her without anyone yelling NO TOUCHING!, when I could walk about without shackles, that I was finally able to believe.Right now my goal is to be with the kids, support them, help them stay in school. It was a long time I was gone, and for now I am free – but they were put in a difficult place. My youngest daughter always cries, she wants me to sleep in the bed with her every night because she’s worried she’ll wake up one day and I won’t be there. I’m relieved, but I still feel like a prisoner – without documentation, I’m not allowed to work, I’m not allowed to drive, and I don’t have anyone to really talk to. If I get scared, or if I have a strange feeling, I just text my lawyer.The process is difficult, but the hardest thing is the uncertainty. Not knowing. When you’re in detention, they own you. You’re impotent. They take a hold of you. And that’s where the uncertainty comes in. You don’t know if it will be weeks, months, or years until they make a decision. It becomes difficult to tell reality from fiction. It changes your state of mind. It’s like you are dead, but actually you are alive. It’s like when they put meat in the freezer.

But the teacher said that I should forget it, because Indians were only fit for giving birth.”Twenty years later, Cruz is an anthropologist and curator at the Gustavo Paige archaeological museum – and she has played a key role in a project bringing together archaeologists, historians and astronomers to help solve a 500-year-old enigma.The investigation focussed on rows of cairn-like pillars – known in the indigenous Quechua language as the saywas, or markers – which are dotted throughout the desert, close to the ancient pathways of the Qhapaq Ñan – an Inca road network stretching from southern Colombia to central Chile.Dr Cecilia Sanhueza, of Chile’s Pre-Columbian Art Museum, had studied the saywas for some 20 years.But their true purpose was elusive. They were built in the middle of the desert, too sporadic to be milestones, and little use as signposts. “They had to have another function,” said Sanhueza.Sanhueza turned to the illustrated chronicles of Quechua nobleman Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala and 16th-century Quechua-Spanish dictionaries, which suggested that many saywas had a calendrical, astronomical and religious purpose. On the winter and summer solstices, the sun god, Inti, was believed to “rest” atop them.Sanhueza approached astronomers at the nearby Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA) and European Southern Observatory (ESO), where astronomers Sergio Martin and Juan Cortés ran simulations of sunrises on selected dates – and found that the sun appeared to align perfectly with the markers.“It was completely different to what we normally do,” said Martin. “But by collaborating we were able to understand the saywas more deeply.”It seemed that – somewhat akin to Stonehenge – the saywas had a simultaneous calendrical, ritual and political purpose. The uncannily precise solar phenomenon above the Inca stonework was designed to broadcast the “sacred power” of the Inca, even 1,000 miles away from Cuzco, Sanhueza suggested. Others marked borders between different climactic zones.Meanwhile, Cruz interviewed retired nomadic llama herders who had trudged the Qhapac Ñan a few decades ago. “I wanted to understand what the Inca would have experienced if they passed through here in winter,” said Cruz.The team braved extreme heat, freezing cold and altitude sickness to properly survey the saywas for the first time in over 20 years. Finally, on the autumn equinox in 2017, they waited for sunrise at a site called Vaquillas. Cruz performed a small ceremony with coca leaves. As if on cue, the sun rose directly atop the line of the saywas. “It was a very emotional and beautiful moment,” said Sanhueza. Three months later, on the winter solstice, they observed the same phenomenon at a separate site.But the alignment of a third location remained a mystery. Cruz, recalling childhood family rituals observed in honour of Pachamama, the Andean earth mother, on 1 August, suggested observing them on that date. The suggestion paid off. “Being behind the saywa and seeing that the sun rose exactly above it … it was incredible,” said Cruz.Cruz is recruiting local volunteers to help preserve them.The findings – announced in April this year – are a personal vindication. But they are also likely to fuel growing interest in the distinct indigenous heritage of northern Chile. “We’re from an Andean culture that has its own vision,” agreed Esteban Velásquez, former mayor of the nearby city of Calama and a congressman for a new regionalist movement. “Today, we’re writing and recovering our own history.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4501ffa921509543265860117b3ce78e62c82691/0_292_4300_2581/master/4300.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25d5a39f7f3c7947c212b4dbfe70427e","title":"croatia president kolinda grabar kitarovic world cup","story":"Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović saw all but one game at her own expense while sporting a national team shirtShe wore the team shirt and cheered as Croatia faced France in a thrilling World Cup final on Sunday. Later, soaked by the rain, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović smiled in defeat and hugged every player from both teams as the winners were given their medals.Boris Dežulović, a journalist and political commentator, said: “Her presence at the World Cup could definitely be described as an extended pre-election video.“She has used this to reinforce her PR strategy of being the people’s president. This is something she has been doing in Croatia for a while now.“Instead of being limited to the Croatian public, this campaign video of sorts was seen by billions of people all over the world.”Grabar-Kitarović was elected president in 2015, presented as the new “polished” face of the conservative Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ).The party faced a slew of corruption charges over the years, the most noteworthy being those involving the former prime minister Ivo Sanader, who is involved in five overlapping corruption trials.Grabar-Kitarović, largely a HDZ bureaucrat until the 2015 election campaign, embraced the party’s legacy as the representative of the conservative and patriotic right, joining the lengthy protests and sit-ins of Croatian war veterans that coincided with the pre-electoral campaign. However, with her foreign education, excellent command of English and previous high-ranking position in Nato, Grabar-Kitarović stood in stark contrast to the former generals and brutish local mayors usually associated with the HDZ.Her performance in the World Cup is perhaps the clearest indicator of her role in the HDZ and Croatia’s political sphere, where the president is head of state and the country’s chief representative at home and abroad.While the prime minister, Andrej Plenković, is tasked with negotiating with the head of Russia’s Sberbank, the largest single creditor of Croatia’s biggest and most troubled conglomerate, Grabar-Kitarović exchanged jerseys with Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Executive and operational powers reside in Plenković’s government. Grabar-Kitarović is focused on promoting the values that a large part of the Croatian electorate holds dear – love of country and church – and for the president, another term."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0413bbac442c00f8d8935014765bf2ad2ad4230c/0_328_4920_2952/master/4920.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61e02038d091d54e728265e9cdece3d9","title":"france to celebrate world cup win with paris victory parade","story":"Squad will also have reception with French president after night of national celebrationThe French football team will stage a World Cup victory parade on an open-top bus down the Champs-Élysées before a reception with the president, Emmanuel Macron, as commentators said the frenzied football celebrations marked a new kind of patriotism.About 1 million supporters gathered on the Paris avenue after the match on Sunday night, watching the Arc de Triomphe lit up in red, white and blue with the players’ names and towns projected on to it. All through the night, cars sped around Paris with people leaning out of windows, sitting on bonnets, lying on roofs or hanging out of car boots to a cacophony of horns. Motorbikes zig-zagged around the streets with passengers carrying flags. In Marseille, people jumped into the water of the old port.More than 19 million people in mainland France watched the match on TV, with hundreds of thousands gathered in fanzones and outside bars across the country. Hundreds gathered at the Carillon bar in Paris’s 10th arrondissement, where nine people were killed by gunmen in the 2015 terrorist attacks.But there were disturbances and riot police fired teargas when a small number of men threw stones at and broke into a Publicis Drugstore on the Champs-Élysées, with police later clearing the area with water cannon. On Monday morning, Publicis Drugstore was clearing up smashed windows and a pillaged shop floor. The interior ministry said there had been 292 arrests across France overnight following the World Cup victory.Two people died in the celebrations. In Annecy, a man in his 50s died after jumping into a shallow canal, and in the Oise region of northern France, a man celebrating in his car was killed after he hit a tree. Three children aged between three and six were also seriously injured after a man celebrating on a motorbike hit them in Frouard in the north-east.The French team will land in Paris at around 4pm, with the Paris victory parade beginning an hour later. Macron, who has recently dipped in the polls due to his image as a “president of the rich”, will host the team at the presidential palace on Monday after long celebrations in Moscow, where he was pictured punching the air, hugging the players on the pitch, then addressing them in their dressing room after the match. “Kids, a big thank you, you allowed us to dream … You have made 60 million French people dream, and children everywhere. You’ll see that tomorrow when you come home and I host you,” he told them.It is not clear whether Macron will see his approval ratings rise amid the celebrations. When France previously won the World Cup in 1998, the unpopular rightwing president Jacques Chirac enjoyed a lift in the polls.The sports minister, Laura Flessel, told French radio the victory allowed young French people in the suburbs, where key players such as Kylian Mbappé grew up, “to dare to believe in their dreams”.

Unlike nuns, they do not live in enclosed communities or wear special clothing. Most have jobs, and they provide for their own needs.The 39-page Vatican document offers detailed guidance on the vocation, including advising up to two years’ preparation before consecration.It says consecrated virgins “are dedicated to the Lord Jesus in virginity … They experience the spiritual fertility of an intimate relationship with him”.But the clause that has surprised some says actual virginity is not essential for a woman to become a consecrated virgin.“The call to give witness to the church’s virginal, spousal and fruitful love for Christ is not reducible to the symbol of physical integrity,” it says.“Thus to have kept her body in perfect continence or to have practiced the virtue of chastity in an exemplary way, while of great importance with regard to the discernment, are not essential prerequisites in the absence of which admittance to consecration is not possible.”In a statement, the US Association of Consecrated Virgins, which says there are 235 consecrated virgins across America, said the document was “deeply disappointing in its denial of integral virginity as the essential and natural foundation of the vocation”.“It is shocking to hear from Mother Church that physical virginity may no longer be considered an essential prerequisite for consecration to a life of virginity,” it added.Women dress as brides for the consecration ceremony, in which they pledge perpetual virginity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1a11414c7f798fafae92140ce8deb16d0f88595/111_0_607_364/master/607.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bf374c04b44a45caffc8bf1a9ba6983","title":"the right to sit indian law change allows women workers to rest","story":"Mainly female workforce in shops not allowed to sit, lean against a wall or use a liftCybil Wilson has worked in one of Kerala’s big, shiny, brightly-lit sari shops for 10 years.Her salary at the shop, in Trivandrum, has been consistently low but it is the pain and swelling in her legs that troubles her the most. Her employer forbids Wilson, and the other 120 female sales assistants working across the four floors, from sitting down during a 12-14 hour shift.“We can’t use the lifts either. All customers pay on the ground floor for their purchases and we have to accompany them so we are up and down the stairs all day. A few times, when we did use the lift, customers complained about having to share it with us,” said Wilson.Now the Kerala government has announced it will amend its labour laws to include a clause obliging employers to let women sit – the result of a fight by a women’s union for “irippu samara” (the right to sit in Malayalam) for these unrepresented shop workers.Most owners of sari shops and other retail outlets forbid women, the bulk of the shop workforce, to sit. Even leaning against a wall can be punished. Lunch is 30 minutes. Toilet breaks are strictly limited. Talking to colleagues can lead to salary deductions. Employers monitor CCTV footage to check for compliance.The women’s union, called Amtu, was set up by Viji Penkoot, the leader of a women’s collective, Penkootu, when the male-dominated unions in the state ignored the issue.She began agitating for the right to sit eight years ago, when a sales assistant in Kozhikode who leaned against a wall while a customer pondered which sari to buy, had her pay cut by 100 rupees (£1) for the “offence”. “The women are careful not to drink too much because they cannot go to the toilet when they want to. They get urinary infections, kidney problems. They have varicose veins and joint pain from standing. It took us a long time for the government to pay any attention to this problem,” said Penkoot. On 4 July, the Kerala state cabinet, reacting to street protests by shop assistants, announced it would amend the existing law, which fails to specify which amenities should be provided to sales assistants, to include the right to sit. “It’s our policy to protect the interests of all our women workers and this gap in the law had to be plugged,” said Thozil Bhawan, a labour commissioner. The new law will stipulate a minimum monthly starting salary of 10,000 rupees (£110), an eight-hour day, a chair or stool, an afternoon tea break, and a lunch break, with a duration yet to be decided by the Kerala cabinet, be provided."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d03e93ff6e53e5600c25fe39fd5de68eecf70fc1/0_268_5421_3254/master/5421.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8948685d24ba3ff69199eb38cb670d89","title":"true human cost 5 pound hand car wash modern slavery","story":"The UK’s hand car washes tend to be extremely competitive with pricing, but they have also been linked to modern slavery. Are they ever fair for workers?One night in August 2015, after a long shift at the Bubbles car wash in east London, Sandu Laurentiu was washing himself in the rat-infested shared flat provided by his employer. Shaip Nimani, 53, originally from Kosovo, had illegally bypassed the electricity meter at the property in Bethnal Green and tampered with the fuses to stop them blowing. The plumbing in the damp bathroom was not earthed. While he used the decrepit power shower, Laurentiu was electrocuted and killed.The death of the 40-year-old Romanian labourer renewed concern about conditions at thousands of hand car washes across the country. The washes, which have mushroomed in petrol stations, car parks and empty forecourts, offer cleaning for as little as £5. Often they employ as many as a dozen workers and are open for up to 12 hours a day, seven days a week. There are suspicions of minimum wage, environmental, planning, and health and safety violations, tax evasion – as well as labour exploitation and modern slavery.Last year, Nimani received a four-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to manslaughter. But, three years after Laurentiu’s death, and more than a decade after car washes started to become a common sight, the response to the problem is only now gathering pace. Last month, the environmental audit committee (EAC) heard the first oral evidence at an inquiry into hand car washes. MPs will spend weeks hearing from academics, industry representatives and regulators.Raids on suspected hand car washes are becoming more common. In the past month, police have swooped on sites in Somerset and Manchester. A raid at the end of June on a car wash in Newport in South Wales, ended in tragedy when Sudanese worker Mustafa Dawood, who was 23, fled on to the roof of a neighbouring factory and fell to his death. The Independent Office for Police Conduct is investigating the incident.There is little agreement about how many hand car washes there are in the UK. Estimates range from 10,000 to 20,000. Less still is known about how many of these may be guilty of infringements. Mechanical car washes, with their fierce rotating bristles, used to be the go-to for drivers in a hurry. Now there is more choice, but little to inform ethical decisions. What is the true cost of a £5 car wash – and what should we be paying?The rise of hand car washes is the result of what is known as economic restructuring. Petrol stations have closed as drivers fill up at supermarkets. Pubs and their car parks have been abandoned as drinkers fill up at home. Garages and their forecourts have closed as cars become more reliable and locked into service agreements. The businesses among these that remain open, meanwhile, are finding ways to make more money out of their outdoor space.As entrepreneurs and opportunists have identified abandoned or available land – and a demand among drivers for cheap, effective car washing – changes in the labour market, partly as a result of EU migration, have supplied the workers. For many visitors, car washes are a first job. “They accept car washing for a short period while they improve their language skills and move into other industries,” says Ian Clark, a professor of work and employment at Nottingham Business School. “But there are also car-wash workers without networks who are in a dead end, working there for long periods.”The EAC heard last month that a car wash costing less than £6 could be funding modern slavery. Crude calculations illuminate the problem. A £5 car wash employing five workers for 10 hours a day would have a minimum wage bill (at £7.83 an hour for workers over 25) of £391.50. That team would need to wash 79 cars a day to bring in that kind of cash, or one car every seven and a half minutes. That’s a doable rate, but it relies on a constant flow of cars and ignores overheads – chemicals, water, equipment, rent, tax – and the need for profit.Many car washes employ more than five workers. Even if the margins can be higher on valet services, which can cost as little as £12 for a full inside-and-out clean, it’s hard to see how “from £5” pays a living wage. “Last weekend I drove past a car wash that was offering washes for £2.99,” says Darryl Dixon, the director of strategy at the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA). “But there are drivers who are only interested in getting the cheapest wash. If it looks too good to be true, it probably is.”Testimony from car-wash workers is patchy but Clark and others have been able to build a picture of some of the tougher conditions on drenched forecourts. “Like nail bars and small garment manufacturers, car washes are what we call ‘hard-to-reach places’,” Clark explains. As part of a study of washes, Clark and his team spoke to workers from 45 hand car washes in the east Midlands. They found no cases of modern slavery or people trafficking, “but we have developed a theory of more routine exploitation of workers”, he says.Anecdotal evidence from elsewhere has suggested a rise in trench foot and chemical burns. At one wash, workers were reportedly paid only in the coins they were able to hoover out of car seats. Car washes that take only cash fuel suspicions of tax avoidance or organised crime. Then there is the environmental damage. “You’ve got to look out for what they’re washing on,” says Dawn Frazer, managing director of the Car Wash Advisory Service (CWAS), which has started a WashMark scheme for legitimate car washes. Tarmac, she explains, is porous. “Any chemical used in the wash is going to go straight into the subsoil.” Concrete prevents this, while a sludge trap or similar device should be used to stop chemicals entering waterways or sewers.Beyond checking for concrete and prices below £6, what can drivers do to avoid potentially problematic car washes? Frazer, who believes £9 is a reasonable minimum price for a basic wash, advises checking for the overall quality of a site. “If it’s being held together with bits of string, that’s another indicator,” she says. Nearby caravans or signs of on-site accommodation are a potential concern, as is an absence of receipts.While the scale of the problem remains largely unknown, and workers themselves report being reluctant to raise the alarm, drivers are being recruited to help identify problem sites. The church is playing an unlikely role the Anglican and Catholic churches in England have backed a new Safe Car Wash phone app. It asks drivers for a site’s location and name (if there is one), followed by a series of questions about it and its workers. It encourages drivers not to confront workers. Instead, the Church of England’s Clewer Initiative against anti-slavery, which launched the app on 4 June, shares the data with the National Crime Agency and the GLAA, among other authorities. If answers to the questions about safety gear and other observations suggests a potential problem, users are also encouraged to contact the Modern Slavery Helpline.“Too often we rush in, you’re on your phone and see all this activity, you give your £6 and drive off,” says Alastair Redfern, the bishop of Derby, who works on anti-slavery projects in the church and the House of Lords. “We’re just saying, please stop and think first.” The Clewer Initiative says the app was downloaded more than 5,000 times in its first month, while the charity Unseen, which runs the slavery helpline, said last week that 11 cases indicating 69 potential victims had been reported to it through the app.But concern about car washes that may be contravening one or several laws and regulations should not lead to assumptions about all such businesses, Frazer adds. There are legitimate businesses that offer competitive prices. That some car washes might have sub-standard drainage does not necessarily mean they are fronts of organised crime. “And if workers look a bit bedraggled, it doesn’t mean it’s all to do with modern slavery – you cannot generalise in that way,” Frazer adds.To help distinguish between the good, the bad and the not entirely legitimate, the CWAS, which is funded by industry membership, is promoting its WashMark certificate of quality and compliance. Businesses that want the badge must share their company accounts and employment and environmental practices with a visiting inspector. Regular, unannounced visits follow the award of the mark. But there were only a dozen accredited sites at the time of writing. While Frazer is training 10 new staff, and hopes to audit 120 sites in the next three months, making an impact on the industry any time soon looks like a tall order.There is also a rival scheme, which further complicates the issue. The GLAA is developing a code of practice for the estimated 500 car washes operating on supermarket car parks, which would be regulated by the supermarkets. These would represent a small fraction of the total car washes in operation, but Dixon, at the GLAA, says engaging drivers in the issue, and making them demand better car washes, creates an incentive for good businesses to improve practices and come forward to get a stamp of approval. “The ones that don’t are the ones where the greatest risk is likely to exist, and therefore we would be better able to target them,” he adds.Supermarkets are already waking up to the problem. Tesco has partnered with Waves, a car washing business based in Surrey, to provide Tesco-branded washes at dozens of its stores. But at the same time, petrol stations that had relied on mechanical washes are switching to hand washes. “It’s a case of ‘can’t beat them, join them’,” says Brian Madderson, a major critic of the hand wash industry as chairman of the Petrol Retailers and Car Wash Associations. “I’m really concerned that our members might be damaging their brands by unknowingly fostering illegal activities on their sites.”Until the host of authorities whose roles are touched by hand car washes get to grips with the problem, once they have determined its scale in the first place, drivers have to make their own choices. Frazer only visits hand car washes that she knows are compliant, “which is why my car is a bit dirty at the moment”, she says. Meanwhile, although deaths associated with car washes are rare, it is the workers who are paying the price for convenience.After Nimani was jailed for the death of Laurentiu, the victim’s brother, Marius, described his brother as a kind and loving son who spoke to their mother every week and sent money home. He added: “It appears to me that the employment laws and rules and regulations in the UK are not strong enough, and that more needs to be done to protect the welfare and wellbeing of foreign nationals, to stop incidents like this happening again.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3566599.1531739352!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin and wicklow face night time water restrictions today","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPressure will be cut to homes and businesses for seven hours each night from 10pm until 5am. Photograph: Frank MillerNight-time water restrictions will be put in place from 10pm to 5am across the city centre and in 33 suburbs in Dublin and Wicklow from Monday.  Pressure will be cut across these areas for seven hours each night, with some households having only a “trickle” at the kitchen sink for these times.  Most of the affected suburbs are on the southside of the city, with just nine northside suburbs due to be hit with restrictions. While the restrictions will stretch through south Dublin all the way to Bray in north Wicklow, Beaumont will be the most northerly suburb affected.Water restrictions in the greater Dublin area will be reviewed in a week by Irish Water.The company said the restrictions will be reviewed next Monday. This morning senior management met to discuss the water network difficulties, brought on by the recent high temperatures and sustained drought.The management team reviewed supply levels to over 100 under-pressure water schemes across the country.Since a critical high point in late June, where demand outstripped the supply capacity of the Dublin network, the amount of water being drawn down by homes and businesses has declined.A national ban on households using their garden hosepipe introduced at the start of the month is in place until the end of July.The greater Dublin water network can supply 610 megalitres of treated water a day. Some 590 megalitres was used on July 3rd this dropped to 568 ml a day by July 9th and was down to 559 ml yesterday.Some 3,500 restaurants stand to be affected by the Dublin night time water restrictions. Most residential suburbs affected are in Dublin, but Bray, Co Wicklow, is also included in the conservation measures.Pressure will be cut to homes and businesses for seven hours each night from 10pm until 5am, Irish Water has said. Most customers will experience low night-time pressures but “no loss of supply”.Supply to some customers on high ground and at the remote end of networks may reduce to a “trickle” at the kitchen sink.Irish Water have said a sustained period of rainfall over two weeks would be needed to address supply problems. The knock-on effects of the drop in supply due to the exceptional period of warm weather may affect the water system into the autumn.The next level of restriction would see the reduction in supply extended from 9pm to 7am, but Irish Water said this is not currently planned.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":null,"title":"flight tracker shows sudden descent of ryanair flight","story":"  July 14, 2018Passengers bleeding from ears and oxygen masks dropped as plane landed in Frankfurt "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3566134.1531687767!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish water to become single national utility","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEoghan Murphy: he has received advice from the Attorney General  on potential wording for a referendum on enshrining public ownership of water services in the Constitution.  Photograph: Cyril Byrne Irish Water is to be separated from Ervia and established as a single national utility to operate the State’s water services.The proposals, which were presented to Cabinet by Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy last Thursday for approval, will come into effect by 2023, The  has learned.It is understood the plans, approved by Cabinet, will allow for Irish Water to become solely responsible for the production, distribution and monitoring of drinking water and for the provision of public waste-water services.Currently the utility has service level agreements (SLAs) with local authorities to operate such services on its behalf, but under these new proposals such arrangements would be brought to an end by 2021.The ending of the agreements with city and county councils is likely to result in job losses at local authority level, but the precise details or the scale of such are not yet known.Government figures said Irish Water was always a standalone entity within the Ervia group. However, given the abolishing of domestic water charges and planned new oversight measures of Irish Water by the Comptroller and Auditor General, it “is time to separate it out of Ervia entirely”.Ending the SLAs early will help “deliver savings for taxpayers”, a senior source said.Irish Water has estimated it could result in savings of €70 million per year.The board of the utility and Ervia are to be formally notified of the changes this week, it is understood.The decision follows weeks of water shortages across the country, and comes as restrictions on water pressure begin to take effect across the greater Dublin area on Monday.Meanwhile, Mr Murphy has confirmed he has received advice from the Attorney General Séamus Woulfe on potential wording for a referendum on enshrining public ownership of water services in the Constitution.In a letter to the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, the Minister said he could not accept the initial wording proposed by Independents4Change TD Joan Collins as it may have unintended consequences for group and private water services.However, in his correspondence, Mr Murphy added: “My intended outcome is to be in a position to bring a recommendation to Government on a wording capable of being prepared as an amendment to the Bill. My aim is to have clarity on the intended approach when the Dáil resumes after its summer recess in September.”Last October, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar ruled out a referendum on ownership of the public water system. However, the Government’s Water Services Policy, published this year, contradicted that position.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/27/TELEMMGLPICT000167700946_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqY0XMnE4berkpvWhc-fw2CHnYvmhjopjBo5wANh2lLAw.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"turning fan around can help sleep better heatwave","story":"digitalservices@telegraphThe unusual method of pointing a fan out of a window can help you keep cool in a heatwave digitalservices@telegraphAs Britain continues to bask in blue skies and wall-to-wall sunshine, cryophiles with a penchant for cooler climes have been exchanging tips on how to stay cool during the heatwave.They range from the bizarre, like eating chilli and painting your roof white, to practical tips likes wearing light clothes and keeping your curtains closed during the day.One particularly unconventional method championed by a New Zealand-based eco-warrior involves pointing an electric fan outside of your open bedroom window to keep cool at night.  Nelson Lebo, an eco design adviser for Palmerston North city council in the South Pacific nation’s North Island, explains the clever fan trick works by blowing the warm air stagnating inside your property outwards, while pulling cooler air in.He explained the fan should be set up just after sunset, when the temperature outside becomes cooler than inside your home.Mr Lebo, who is originally from the US, said he learnt the trick from his grandmother who used it in New Jersey during the Seventies.“Everyone knows about cross ventilation,” he told The , “but it only works when the wind is blowing and then it works best when there is a direct route for the wind to blow through a home.“What the fan does is, it forces cross ventilation, even when the wind is not blowing. A fan will also pull air around corners, as in our home.“The overall goal is to pull the warm air out while drawing cool air in once the outdoor temperature drops below the indoor temperature. Fans use hardly any power compared to AC.”  Mr Lebo added that while pointing the fan outside the window may seem counterintuitive to some, it is a lot more effective than the standard method.“The standard way simply pushes warm air around the room but we perceive it as cooling because moving air feels cooler than still air,” he says.“My technique of forced cross ventilation actually cools indoor air down by drawing in air cooled for free by nature that is just outside from late afternoon onward.”It could be time to turn that fan around He added: “Just make sure the bedroom windows are the ones with the air entering! The outward facing fan must be in the far end of the dwelling.”The UK enjoyed the hottest day of the year on Tuesday as temperatures peaked at 30.6C (87F), with the heatwave showing no signs of abating.Trump challenges Putin on US election meddling at key US-Russia summit - live updatesBuilding a  air force at the Royal International Air TattooDrones brought in to help hunt six-meter python on the loose near WarsawIsraeli rockets strike military position near Aleppo in SyriaPutin says Russia targeted by almost 25 million cyber-attacks during World CupHotels targeted in Majorca as anti-tourist protests hit airportCrimea, Iran and nuclear arms: What Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin want from Helsinki talksComment: Donald Trump likes Putin because he is a Brexit president – pulling America out of the old orderTrump sends envoys to Afghanistan to open talks directly with Taliban over peace dealMeet the gamers willing to spend hundreds of thousands living their video game fantasy Children to learn perils of social media at school, Education Secretary announcesChicago police release bodycam footage of fatal shooting that sparked a weekend of mass protestsIndonesian villagers kill nearly 300 crocodiles in revenge attackDuke and Duchess of Cambridge release new picture of laughing Prince Louis after his christening Drinking full-fat milk could protect against strokes, study suggestsGareth Southgate has Tube station renamed after him as England return from Russia Elon Musk launches baseless Twitter attack on Thai cave rescue er Queen watches over Prince Louis in official christening portrait - but can you spot Her Majesty?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"digitalservices@telegraphHead of Digital Publishingdigitalservices@telegraphMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

He studied for 13 years at the Dar ul-Uloom Deoband, the most influential Muslim seminary in south Asia, speaks fluent Pashto and wears local dress.After working for the BBC\u0027s Pashto service in the 1990s and creating another popular soap called New Home, New Life, he then set up his own production house, Pact Radio, in Jalalabad in 2004.With a passion for Pashto radio and a mission to find “traditional solutions for modern problems” his soaps have in the past tackled women\u0027s rights, militancy, the rule of law and health.Health issues have also become a favourite of British soaps, with Coronation Street and The Archers recently tackling sepsis and several storylines revolving around mental health.“You can actually bring up issues in a soap opera which you can\u0027t bring up in day to day journalism,” he said.Recent plot lines have seen characters debate polio vaccination and question hearsay that drops are harmful. Extremists have preached against the global vaccination programme and health workers have been attacked in Afghanistan and Pakistan.“Pashtuns will just believe anything you tell them and that\u0027s the whole problem actually.“Whatever the facts say, they don\u0027t believe facts, they believe hearsay, they believe rumour and that\u0027s what the problem with polio is. If someone says its Bush\u0027s urine, okay it\u0027s Bush\u0027s urine.“There is a saying in Pashto that if you tell a Pashtun a dog has bitten off your ear, then the Pashtun will run after the dog, but won\u0027t check his ear to see if it\u0027s there or not.”Mr Butt still ides his time between Afghanistan and India.“It\u0027s a very infuriating country but then at the same time you feel that you are doing some good,” he said.But the country\u0027s complexities can provide great radio, he said.“You listen sometimes to The Archers and it\u0027s all \u0027the Environmental Agency is going to be coming and checking your land, because your land is contaminated\u0027 and this and that. It\u0027s really boring actually, the Archers.

What goes on down there affects the whole of the earth in which we live.Captain Robert Falcon Scott led a team of British explorers to become the first to reach the South Pole, on what was his second Antarctic mission.His party arrived at the South Pole on January 17 in 1912, but found they were beaten there five weeks earlier after Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen led his own expedition. Scott and his explorers died on March 29 while returning from the trek after a planned rendezvous with support teams failed.Speaking after tug boats had manoeuvred the vast steel hull down the slipway at Cammell Laird, Sir David said: “It was an extraordinarily emotional moment. I\u0027m surprised myself really.I\u0027ve never seen a ship of that size get down a slipway and there was something very noble about it and very emotional. Irresistible.And, to think that it\u0027s going to go to the other end of the globe and do such valuable work and carry so many people from this country who will be working to find out all they can about the working of our planet is a marvellous thought.”Sir David and Professor Dame Jane Francis, director of BAS, pressed the button to launch the vessel into the water in front of more than 2,000 shipyard workers, scientists, engineers and guests.In the water, tugboats pulled the ship into a “wet basin” where construction work will continue. Once complete the vessel will be comprised of one million pieces of steel, 30km of piping, 5,000 valves, and 450km of cabling.Please review our commenting policyTrump challenges Putin on US election meddling at key US-Russia summit - live updatesBuilding a  air force at the Royal International Air TattooDrones brought in to help hunt six-meter python on the loose near WarsawIsraeli rockets strike military position near Aleppo in SyriaPutin says Russia targeted by almost 25 million cyber-attacks during World CupHotels targeted in Majorca as anti-tourist protests hit airportCrimea, Iran and nuclear arms: What Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin want from Helsinki talksComment: Donald Trump likes Putin because he is a Brexit president – pulling America out of the old orderTrump sends envoys to Afghanistan to open talks directly with Taliban over peace dealMeet the gamers willing to spend hundreds of thousands living their video game fantasy Children to learn perils of social media at school, Education Secretary announcesChicago police release bodycam footage of fatal shooting that sparked a weekend of mass protestsIndonesian villagers kill nearly 300 crocodiles in revenge attackDuke and Duchess of Cambridge release new picture of laughing Prince Louis after his christening Drinking full-fat milk could protect against strokes, study suggestsGareth Southgate has Tube station renamed after him as England return from Russia Elon Musk launches baseless Twitter attack on Thai cave rescue er Queen watches over Prince Louis in official christening portrait - but can you spot Her Majesty?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/men/2017/08/03/TELEMMGLPICT000136373439_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqEfErTK9y_UY_UAjNuiqN25H9RvIS_y7oDWQlJlzu5JQ.jpeg?imwidth=450\"","title":"laughed tinder now see has greatly improved modern romance","story":"digitalservices@telegraphA woman selects 3D-printed models of real men from a shelf Love is still an adventure, but it is far easier than it was in the age of Jane Austen I recently went to a Tinder wedding.

that\u0027s all he is, Unsworth added.Unsworth, who lives part of the year in Thailand, took part in the gargantuan 18-day effort to retrieve the 12 boys and their coach, a mission that ended on July 10 when the last five members were extracted.The boys got stuck in the cave after wandering in on June 23 after football practice only to find themselves trapped by rising floodwaters.Musk released images of a device by SpaceX and The Boring Company designed to help in the Thai cave rescue bidThey were found nine days later on a muddy embankment several kilometres (miles) inside.The unprecedented operation to haul them out involved sedating the footballers and swimming and carrying them through tight, waterlogged passages.The boys are all in good health and expected to be released from the hospital Thursday.Musk\u0027s tweets prompted condemnation from those who took part in the mission to save the boys.Claus Rasmussen, a Danish national and instructor at Blue Label ing in Phuket, called the allegations inappropriate and praised Unsworth\u0027s role in the rescue.He was the guy who effectively mapped most of that cave, he told AFP.He was one of the driving forces in getting everything done and clarifying for us ers what was going on.Musk had earlier provoked condemnation after tweeting that the Thai rescue chief, who had declined the submarine prototype offer, was not really in charge of the operation.Please review our commenting policyTrump challenges Putin on US election meddling at key US-Russia summit -

The European Commission and EU consumer authorities said on Monday that Airbnb’s current pricing presentation and a number of its terms do not comply with various regulations, including the unfair commercial practices directive. As a result, the EU has “demanded from Airbnb a number of changes”, including a change in the way it presents price information, and more clarity in the company’s policy on refunds, compensation and damage claims.\u0026nbspThe EU said Airbnb\u0026nbspshould ensure that\u0026nbspwhenever properties are offered\u0026nbspthe consumer is provided with the total price inclusive of all the applicable mandatory charges and fees, such as service and cleaning charges, or, if it is not possible to calculate the final price in advance, clearly inform the consumer that additional fees might apply.In addition, the commission said Airbnb needs to make it clear whether an offer is made by a private host or a professional, as different consumer protection rules may apply, and said the firm cannot deprive consumers from their basic legal rights to sue a host in case of personal harm or other damages.The EU is also demanding that the firm provide an easily accessible link to the online dispute resolution platform on its website, along with “all the necessary information related to dispute resolution. Airbnb now has until the end of August to propose “detailed solutions”, the EU said. If the proposals are not considered satisfactory by European authorities, enforcement measures may be taken. Vera Jourova, the European commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality, said: “More and more consumers book their holiday accommodation online and this sector has brought many new opportunities to holidaymakers.

This is how Airbnb\u0027s changes will affect holidaymakers“Consumers must easily understand what for and how much they are expected to pay for the services and have fair rules e.g. on cancellation of the accommodation by the owner. I expect Airbnb to follow up swiftly with the right solutions.”A spokesperson for Airbnb said: “We take this issue seriously and are committed to being as transparent as possible for our community. Guests are made aware of all fees, including service charges and taxes, prior to confirming their decision to book a listing, and we will work together with the authorities to clarify the points raised.” Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

With an estimated worth of $1bn, a trade body and a recognised marketing award, they have finally been tamedClick to followThe Independent OnlinePep talk: Kendall Jenner’s Pepsi advert was pulled shortly after it aired for appearing to trivialise demonstrations tackling social causesLast month, the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity –\u0026nbspthe biggest grouping of advertising and marketing people you could ever hope to avoid –\u0026nbspintroduced a new award: the Social and Influencer\u0026nbspcategory.Yes, those\u0026nbspgurning thumb-flexers forever punching #YOLO, #instacool and #nofilter into their smartphones as they plug products have come of age.\u0026nbspInfluencer-dom is now a fully-fledged industry. Yet only a year or two ago we were told by many (rather gleefully in some cases) that the influencer was dead or at least in crisis.Earlier this year, this seemed to be confirmed as the owner of the White Moose Cafe in Dublin turned the tables on\u0026nbsp22-year-old YouTube vlogger and influencer Elle Darby, by exposing her demand for five free hotel nights in return for exposure.His public burn spoke for many: “If I let you stay here in return for a feature in a video, who is going to pay the staff who look after you?” The twitter-mob turned on influencers. Who were they? How do they get away with it? Do they actually earn money?When the influencer marketing industry began (around 2008-10, attest the form’s historians) the notion took hold that like celebrity endorsement before it, aspirational people could become marketing tools, accessing the consumer mind as if a recommendation from a friend.YouTuber with 139,095 subscribers, was refused a free hotel stay (YouTubeElle Darby)As one observer put it:\u0026nbsp“They emerged almost overnight and in 10 years have gone from a small network to a worldwide community.” Some sources suggest that there is now a baseline of 1.1 million influencers worldwide.\u0026nbspMediakix estimated\u0026nbspthe industry was worth more than $1bn\u0026nbsp(£750m)\u0026nbspin 2017. Malcolm Gladwell’s coinage, “the tipping point”, was used a lot in meetings.\u0026nbspBy about 2014, a baffled world had started to understand influencer marketing, but the industry’s breakthrough year was probably 2016 when, as Hamda Issa-Salwe of Bravado, part of Universal Music Group, found when she did a research thesis called Investigating the Use of Influencer Marketing on Social Media.“It began to soar,” she says. “Google classified ‘influencer’ as a breakout keyword with a 5,000 per cent month by month increase in the number of times the search term ‘influencer marketing’ was typed.”Also in 2016, it was established that Kendall Jenner was paid an estimated $300,000 per social media post. Advertising agencies took more careful notice of influencers and Instagram –\u0026nbspfounded in 2010 – became the key station of the social media cross, along with other key platforms\u0026nbspsuch as YouTube, Snapchat and Pinterest.Even the fustiest legacy-media type can now see the point. The barrier to entry is low. All you need is a smartphone and a certain brio. And the research seems to add up. According to Nielsen, 84 per cent\u0026nbspof consumers trust opinions from people they know, while 70 per cent\u0026nbsptake action based on other consumer’s opinions online.vlogger Zoella reportedly has a net worth of £2.5m (InstagramZoella)The Association of National Advertisers found that 75 per cent\u0026nbspof members already work with influencers, and the growing industry will take 20 per cent\u0026nbspof the total global marketing budget by 2023.No wonder that 82 per cent\u0026nbspof millennials hope to become influencers at least, according to a survey by London-based dating app CLiKD.\u0026nbspSo the money’s talking, and influencers can do well.It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rentAs Anthony Svirskis, CEO\u0026nbspof TRIBE and a juror on the\u0026nbspSocial and Influencer award says:\u0026nbsp“On a post by post basis, brands should expect to pay £50 for someone with 3,000 followers and upwards of £300 if someone has more than 100,000 followers.” Small wonder the market is seething with aspirant influencers.\u0026nbspYet influencers are still derided as being without any particular skills: even that they’re the apotheosis of the entitled “Me” generation, spreading paid-for blandishments in vocal-fry vlogs on YouTube.While it’s hard to blame someone who travels the world in return for Instagram snaps, is there an influencer bubble waiting to burst? Paul Dyer, of marketing company Lippe Taylor, believes it will, as trust has disappeared from the sector in the sceptical Facebook-Cambridge Analytica era.“There is tremendous value in influencer marketing,” he said recently. “However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls out.”Indeed, there have been several influencer #epicfails, perhaps the most notable being\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspFestival, the ill-fated 2017 Bahamas musical festival that paid Kendall Jenner and Bella\u0026nbspHadid\u0026nbspto drum up support.\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspbombed and the repercussions are ongoing.There’s also an undergrowth of freebie-hunting influencers harassing hotels and providers. Some hotels – the\u0026nbspDusit\u0026nbspThani\u0026nbspresort in the Males among them – now use weeding out processes. “When they work hotels love them,” says one travel PR.\u0026nbspThe influencer economy … is a market irrationality. Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money“Influencers are uncritical and often share films and photographs that would otherwise be paid for. But there’s a trust problem.”There are other cracks in the influencer edifice as brands begin to ask questions about the business efficacy of influencers. As publicist Mark Borkowski says:\u0026nbsp“More brands are beginning to realise that influencer activity doesn’t necessarily drive ROI.”And the pain is on both sides, he adds. “It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rent.” Anti-influencers are coming of the woodwork –\u0026nbspand they’re not all crusty oldies with a grudge.“The influencer economy … is a market irrationality,” wrote Sam Biddle of Gawker in 2016. “Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money.” As for bots and fake followers, that’s a real problem.Fyre Festival attendees locked in airport ‘for their own safety’At Cannes, Unilever’s chief marketing officer Keith Weed called for industry action to clean out the influencer stable, and vowed never to use influencers found to be buying followers.So the sands are shifting. Hamda Issa-Salwe says that while influencer activity remains hard to define and audit, it’s still growing. Although trust and authenticity (the great influencer bon mot) are major factors, brands still spend a lot on influencers: after all,\u0026nbspInstagram has more 800 million monthly active users.And the influencers themselves are fighting back. It’s a new industry: of course legacy dinosaurs wouldn’t get it. It’s just another marketing tool. And what are –\u0026nbspsorry, were –\u0026nbspnewspapers half the time, but a vehicle of paid-for information?“Indeed, there’s a growing distrust of traditional media advertising,” says Harry Hugo, cofounder at The Goat Agency, Europe’s leading influencer agency, which claims to be growing at a rate of 600 per cent\u0026nbspa year.“Just look at the rise in ad blockers, investigations into media transparency and big networks like WPP struggling. Influencers can be one of the most trusted, and therefore highest converting, information sources for people.”\u0026nbspAlso, we jeremiahs just don’t get the craft and graft that goes into an influencer’s brand persona, adds Florencia Lujani, influencer marketing manager at agency We Are Social London.“People struggle to see why brands would pay money to partner with influencers for something which appears relatively simple,” she says. “But it takes time and effort, talent, passion and commitment.”\u0026nbspAnd even the thorny issue of disclosure –\u0026nbspthat is, whether you should know what someone is being paid to promote –\u0026nbspis a smaller issue than is often supposed, says Svirskis. “Influencers are very compliant of requirements to disclose and are often represented by an influencer agency.”There is tremendous value in influencer marketing. However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls outMost importantly of all, influencers make money for clients. Currently, the average ROI of influencer marketing is £7 back for every £1 spent, says Amelia Neate of Influencer Champions.\u0026nbspSo,\u0026nbspdo you have to be pretty? “It’s definitely not reserved for those with looks,” says Svirskis. “The cheesy smiles are long gone.” It’s about style and tone, he says, and as the industry matures it’s moving beyond lifestyle products like travel, beauty and fashion to finance, automotive –\u0026nbspeven dog food.“There are new influencers emerging every day, in every single vertical,” says Lujani. They’re marshalling themselves into communities: mummy bloggers, healthy eaters, sports fans – why, possibly even news organisations.\u0026nbspWith the maturation of the influencer world comes a shakeout: Influencer 2.0, if you will. Sheer numbers don’t matter so much anymore.\u0026nbspThe smart talk is now about engagement and micro-influencers,\u0026nbspthose with fewer than 100,000 followers and possibly as low as 5,000, but with proper peer recognition.\u0026nbspYouTuber Alfie Deyes came under fire for his recent video, ‘How I lived off £1 for a day’ (YouTubePointlessBlogVlogs)“Data shows that influence by measure of engagement actually increases as the audience size reduces,” says Svirskis. In a hedge-betting strategy, brands now prefer to work with 50 micro-influencers rather than one mega-influencer, and brands are taking influencer management in-house as influencer marketing moves into the mainstream.If children are obese then blame food manufacturers, not ZoellaInvestigation promised into Trump campaign data firmThree arrested after Facebook group raid cannabis field – only to Sexist men who abuse women on Facebook and Twitter are compensating“Most new industries go through periods of turbulence as they form foundations,” says Svirskis, who thinks that many of today’s influencers will become tomorrow’s creative directors and entrepreneurs.He has a point. Beauty influencer Emily Weiss now has a cosmetic company, Glossier, and within the last couple of weeks M\u0026ampC Saatchi bought a stake in two influencer agencies.

In order to deceive him and his team, Labour HQ paid for personalised ads to be seen by the party leader, his aides and favoured journalists, while spending far more money on adverts with another message for ordinary voters, according to claims made in a new book by former staffer Tom Baldwin that were reportedly confirmed by party sources.“In 2017, Labour Party officials became so good at targeting Facebook ads, they were able to deceive Jeremy Corbyn about the kind of campaign they were running,” wrote Mr Baldwin, the author of Ctrl Alt Delete: How Politics and the Media Crashed Our Democracy, in the Sunday Times.“When they were told to pay for nationwide ads they regarded as madcap, such as one on voter registration, they made sure that few saw such messages except a tiny slice of left-wing activists.”Mr Baldwin, who was former leader Ed\u0026nbspMiliband’s director of communications, said that a former staffer told him: “If it was there for them, they thought it must be there for everyone. It\u0026nbspwasn’t. That’s how targeted ads can work.”The allegations caused anger and frustration among Corbyn loyalists, who said such behaviour\u0026nbspmay have cost Mr Corbyn the chance to oust Theresa May and enter Downing Street, rather than just obliterating her parliamentary majority.“Before the 2017 election, I remember rebutting endless stories that could only have come from selective leaking by HQ, so this latest revelation is no surprise,” Matt Zarb-Cousin, Jeremy Corbyn’s former spokesman, told The Independent.“If every member of staff at Labour HQ just got on with their jobs, Labour might be in government now. Thankfully, next time an election comes around everyone will be pulling in the same direction, giving Labour the best possible chance of winning.”This sense of frustration was echoed by various other party sources. “Our experiences with the press office were seriously unproductive and bordering on obstructionist while my boss was a shadow frontbencher,” said a Labour staffer.“Before the election it often felt like our shadow team were essentially expected to manage everything on our own with barely any money or coordination from Southside. Now things are being done far more professionally,” they said.Labour pull ahead in polls in wake of May publishing Brexit planJared O’Mara quits Labour Party over handling of tweets scandalGovernment should abandon ‘just say no’ drug policy, say Labour MPsThe claims demonstrate the isions within the Labour Party during the last election and corroborate\u0026nbsplongstanding accusations from left-wing activists that Blairite staffers sought to undermine Mr Corbyn’s campaign.UK news in picturesTheresa May arives to open the Farnborough AirshowNovak Djokovic lifts the trophy after winning the men\u0027s singles final match against Kevin Anderson at WimbledonFar-right protesters demanding the release of jailed EDL founder Tommy Robinson brought chaos to central London after blockading a bus being driven by a woman in a headscarf during the marchUS President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa during their meeting at Chequers in BuckinghamshireUS President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrive in the UKEngland manager Gareth Southgate and his players look dejected after they lost their World Cup semi final match against Croatia at Luzhniki Stadium in MoscowSerena Williams celebrates after winning against Camila Giorgi during their women\u0027s singles quarter-final match on the eighth day of Wimbledon.

They have come – and will continue to crowd in for the next two hours – for two main reasons.The first is because the choice of groceries inside this unrefurbished warehouse is phenomenal: crates of fruit and veg, baskets of breads, a deli counter offering pies and pates and pickles, tinned goods and cakes. Lots of cakes. Very occasionally, you can get blast chilled chicken from Nando’s here – “although,” says Smith, “it flies out the door pretty quick”.The second reason all these customers keep turning up is because of the price for everything in here: “Pay whatever you feel.”People come in, fill their baskets\u0026nbspand then hand over as much or as little money as they want. Some people do weekly shops for a fiver, and that’s fine.What’s the catch? There is one, of course. Everything here has been salvaged from supermarket bins, restaurant leftovers and wholesale market waste. Edibles otherwise marked for landfill have been saved and piled high. Smith once got called by a food bank with a surplus of donated tins and nowhere to store them. He collected them in his van, stuck them in store and watched them get snapped up.Local branches of Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and M\u0026ampS all have his team take their unwanted goods. Today\u0026nbspthere is an abundance of potatoes here. “Too wonky even for the wonky range,” Smith explains with a shrug.This, then, is the Real Junk Food Project, an enterprise created by the 32-year-old one-time executive chef with the aim of reducing the UK’s vast quantities of food waste, while helping people struggling – or simply seeking a bargain – in austerity Britain. And it’s proving more popular than he ever imagined.After he set up his first Sharehouse shop in Leeds in autumn 2016, the scheme has expanded at a rate the Big Four would be proud of. Six more stores have opened in the interim – this one in Sheffield, along with Birmingham, Brighton, Durham, Wigan and Chester – with three more, in Halifax, Wakefield and Keighley scheduled for late summer. Each one saves an estimated six tonnes of food from going to landfill every week. Along with a series of Real Junk Food cafes and Real Junk Food school projects (more of which shortly), Smith estimates that food goes to 25,000 people across the UK every week.And it’s all sorts of people too: families, old folks, millennials and\u0026nbspthe just about managing. Last month, this particular outlet had a massive batch of asparagus come in. “We put it on social media and it went a bit crazy,” says Jo Hercberg, director of the Sheffield project. “We got a whole new foodie customer base from that.“We make no bones about what we offer,” she continues. “Our stock is what most shops would chuck out. Maybe it’s passed its best before date, maybe the lettuce has a browned at the edges, maybe a tin is dented. But we trust our customers to understand that. They do what human beings have always done: they use their sight and smell, and if something seems okay, they’ll have it.”The contradiction that inspired the Real Junk Food Project is a bizarre but real one. Every year, according to UN figures, 1.3 billion tonnes of food are thrown away. Yet, simultaneously, some 800 million people across the planet are malnourished.This paradoxical waste and want first struck Smith while working on an Australian farm five years ago. The surplus there was so pronounced they would feed courgettes to pigs because it was cheaper than buying feed.“But in Sydney there are hundreds of people on the streets who can’t afford to eat,” he says. “It’s that contradiction I want to solve.”Sharehouse store (The Real Junk Food Project)He returned to his home town of Leeds and founded the project. It was a cafe\u0026nbspat first, a single outlet opening for a couple of lunches a week in a converted corner shop in the city’s Armley district. But it used the same principle that\u0026nbspremains at the heart of the enterprise today.“Myself and volunteers persuaded local supermarkets to let us take what they were throwing out,” he explains. “It was pushing an open door because disposing of that waste costs money, so having someone come and take it was a win-win. Then we cooked it all up at the cafe.”Menus varied depending on what they were given: curries, lasagnes and\u0026nbsphot pots. Diners were told to pay what they wanted\u0026nbsp– or even asked to volunteer themselves – in return for the meal.\u0026nbsp“It was just an experiment,” says Smith. “We couldn’t believe how quickly it took off.”Within three months a second was opened by volunteers in Bristol. Then they kept opening. Today\u0026nbspthere are more than 120 worldwide, including in Germany, South Korea and Israel.Each new venue is given basic rules to follow – 90 per cent of food used should be designated waste, for instance – but, largely, they’re left to their own devices as part of a franchise system.The other thing which happened was Smith started receiving calls from places asking him to take their food waste – which finally led him to the idea of his supermarket-style shops.Meijer and Jo Hercberg at the\u0026nbspSharehouse store (The Real Junk Food Project)“We were getting too much food just for the cafes,” he says. “So why not sell it as pay-what-you-feel groceries? The variety of places it comes from, you wouldn’t believe. I got a call the other day from a shipping yard. Someone hadn’t paid rent on a container and they wanted it emptying. It was thousands of tins of peas.”He points it out in the warehouse, which is attached to the shop. “Want to take a couple of cans?” he asks.The shoppers here seem to love the place. They come in, browse, basket in hands, taking their time, asking volunteers question about produce and products.One is Fareesa Awan, who lives near the Sheffield store. “A friend told me about it,” she says. “She told me you go in looking for a bargain but end up walking out with a week’s worth of food. I thought, ‘That I have to try’. It’s wonderful. I don’t do my shopping here because you can’t always guarantee what they will have in but I’ll come and pick up some fruit, veg, cakes\u0026nbspfor the children – and my husband. I like to cook and there’s always something unusual here which you can pick up for next to nothing and then experiment with.”I ask if it bothers her that some of it is passed its best before date and she laughs. “I trust myself to decide what’s OK,” she says. “These dates – who decides them?\u0026nbspThey’re not necessary. Besides, once it’s in our house it does not last long. Big family, lots of visitors. The food soon goes, so it is good to get it cheap.”Back in store, the big question might be: just where does the money come from? Each shop typically has an average of 10 staff (along with dozens of volunteers) and requires large premises, so how does it fund itself?“With difficulty is the honest answer,” is Hercberg’s rueful reply.Each enterprise runs its own finances. Some run paid-for catering events. Others have contracts to provide after-school dinner clubs. One or two have been given council or charitable grants. Customers are often generous when paying for their shop.“But it’s a struggle,” says Hercberg. “There’s not much money giving away food – who’d have thought?”Legally, there have been issues too. The Real Junk Food Project works in the grey area of food regulation, and in April last year\u0026nbspthe Leeds store faced prosecution from West Yorkshire Trading Standards. It was found to have 444 items beyond their expiration date – distinct from “best before”\u0026nbspdates in that, while the latter is advisory only, it is illegal to supply a food which has passed the former.“But, as we said, our food has fed more than a million people and not one has ever reported getting ill,” says Smith. “So we know what we’re doing.”In the end, the project was given a slap on the wrist and told not to stock food beyond its expiration date in future. “I still don’t agree with that,” Smith says. “These dates are arbitrary. They’re there to scare you into buying more often, but this is the law so we comply.”UK news in picturesTheresa May arives to open the Farnborough AirshowNovak Djokovic lifts the trophy after winning the men\u0027s singles final match against Kevin Anderson at WimbledonFar-right protesters demanding the release of jailed EDL founder Tommy Robinson brought chaos to central London after blockading a bus being driven by a woman in a headscarf during the marchUS President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa during their meeting at Chequers in BuckinghamshireUS President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrive in the UKEngland manager Gareth Southgate and his players look dejected after they lost their World Cup semi final match against Croatia at Luzhniki Stadium in MoscowSerena Williams celebrates after winning against Camila Giorgi during their women\u0027s singles quarter-final match on the eighth day of Wimbledon.

I’ve spoke to party leaders – I won’t say who – and they’ve told me there’s no votes in this. I’ve been invited down to Westminster but I’ve stopped going.

Their managers in London got alarmed by how much food they were giving us every day. I think they calculated it up and realised how much money they must be losing by throwing so much stuff out. So, they asked us in as a consultancy to help them reduce their waste.

Her family moved back to the UK months after her birth.Unlike her UK born siblings, who have never faced problems with their status, she has been told she is not British on the grounds that she was not born within the nation’s\u0026nbspboundaries.Vitalis’s\u0026nbspfather\u0026nbspOswald Joseph\u0026nbspVitalis, who flew in\u0026nbspthe RAF\u0026nbspfor 13 yearsMs Vitalis lived in the UK until the age of six, when she moved to the Caribbean with her mother and siblings to go to school there. She returned when she was in her early 20s and began working as a nurse.She faced no problems for 17 years, during which\u0026nbspshe gave birth to a daughter in 1999 and a son in 2005. Her partner later moved to the US after the couple split.In 2013, when Ms Vitalis\u0026nbspwent to collect her 15-year-old daughter from Gatwick Airport after a spell living with her father, she was stopped by\u0026nbspimmigration officials and taken to a detention centre.“I took the day off work and went to collect my daughter from the airport. I was waiting for six hours and then I heard them calling my name on the tannoy to go to a gate. There were two officers,” said Ms Vitalis.“They said they were arresting me and that I was liable for deportation, and that they were going to take me to a detention centre. They took me away.Windrush generation: Home Office ‘set them up to fail’, say MPsHome Office attacked by MPs over detention of Windrush citizens“I couldn’t believe that my father served this country and I was in this predicament with all this embarrassment.”Ms Vitalis was later reunited with her daughter, but she was issued deportation proceedings and therefore was dismissed from her NHS job.She then entered into a “downward spiral of depression”, during which she started gambling and became involved in illegal fraudulent activity, taking money from patients to fund her gambling addiction.“I was able to do some agency work while my case was ongoing. During that time I lost my dad, I lost my brother to suicide, I lost my grandmother. I think I went into a downward spiral because of this immigration thing,” she said.She was charged with 14 counts of fraud totalling £13,052.88 and was sentenced to 28 months in prison in March last year.“I know I did wrong. I did get into gambling. It was really getting out of hand. It got really, really bad. I didn’t object to my sentence or appeal it because I knew I had done something wrong. I served my time.”After Ms Vitalis\u0026nbspserved her sentence,\u0026nbspthe Home Office attempted to deport her.\u0026nbspShe is currently waiting for an appeal decision in October\u0026nbspand is unable to work or claim benefits in the meantime.In deportation papers issued to Ms Vitalis in March 2017, the Home Office claimed that despite her children’s\u0026nbspfather living in the US, there was “no evidence that the care of the child will\u0026nbspbe anything other than safe and effective when you are deported from the UK”.“It’s really frustrating because the information is there.\u0026nbspI was British by birth and not by descent. If my dad hadn’t been working in Germany I would be like my other siblings,” Ms Vitalis\u0026nbspsaid.“They keep saying it’s because I was born in Germany, but why was I born in Germany? My father\u0026nbspwent through so much he was the only black person on his battalion and my mum was the only black person living on the military base. My sister remembers the racism that went on in there.“Having gone through all of that, if my parents knew I was having this problem now… I can’t work, I can’t claim any benefits, I can’t study – what am I supposed to do? I feel embarrassed.\u0026nbsp“This has affected my children – they have no status. My son wants me to get him citizenship. I can’t pay £2,000 for something that I should not have to pay for. They’re suffering because of me.”The case has emerged amid mounting criticism over the\u0026nbspHome Office’s hostile environment following the\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbspscandal, which exposed that thousands of Commonwealth citizens had been wrongly targeted by immigration officials, with some detained and deported –\u0026nbspcosting then home secretary Amber Rudd her job.Labour MP David Lammy told The Independent\u0026nbspsplitting children from their parents was “symptomatic of the cruel and inhumane outcomes of the Home Office’s hostile environment”, and said his office had dealt with many cases similar to that of Ms\u0026nbspVitalis.\u0026nbspWindrush generation: threat of deportation from UKThe ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

So it is quite hard to find any kind of hard evidence that is getting in the government’s way.”The government has recently\u0026nbspchanged the rules slightly and allowed\u0026nbspsome onshore wind projects to compete for subsidies, but only those\u0026nbspoperating in remote islands off the coast of Scotland.In response to the YouGov\u0026nbsppoll, a\u0026nbspspokesperson from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “Our renewables sector is a British success story and we already have 7,000 onshore wind turbines across the UK, generating enough electricity to power seven million homes.\u0026nbsp“The government does not believe new large scale onshore wind power is right for England.

But the UK does not have any way of actually getting them into space, meaning they have to be shipped elsewhere to be launched.Now the British government hopes that this announcement and others will allow the country to launch its plans for a flourishing space industry in the UK.“The announcement of a strategic partnership between Virgin Orbit and Cornwall Spaceport is great news for the region and the UK’s ambitions for regular, reliable and responsible access to space, said UK science minister Sam Gyimah.\u0026nbspThis partnership could see Virgin Orbit’s innovative horizontal launch technology helping the UK’s small satellite industry access space from the convenience of a Spaceport in Cornwall.We will work with both partners to support their ambitions, as we take the next steps in our national spaceflight programme as part of the government’s modern Industrial strategy.”Horizontal launches such as those that will happen in Cornwall\u0026nbspare different from the famous flights that takeoff from Kennedy Space Centre\u0026nbspand elsewhere. Instead of standing up from the beginning, the rocket is attached to a plane and carried up into the air – from there, the rocket separates and flies off into space, carrying the satellite with it.Virgin claims that horizontal launches will allow for cheaper spaceflight, since they mean launches can take place away from busy launchpads.There will soon be vertical rockets taking off from the UK, however, if a plan to launch a new spaceport in Scotland is successful.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

CCTV footage shows the attack and moment he was left for dead.The tragic death that triggered the #JusticeJunior campaign has inspired New York State Senator Luis Sepúlveda and Assemblyman Victor Pichardo to propose Safe Havens for Endangered Children legislations, also called \u0027Junior\u0027s Law\u0027.Speaking alongside some of Junior’s family members outside at a press conference at the bodega where he sought help, Mr Sepulveda said more needed to be done to protect children in danger.We want to make sure that any business owner or their employees who encounter a situation involving a minor who has been abused or may be in danger has a duty to try to help,” he said. Community businesses should be safe havens for our youth. They should promptly notify police.”\u0026nbspHe added that another measure of the bill would ensure that small businesses to have first aid kits on hand “to help those who are injured to save lives”.The proposed bill has the support of Junior’s father Lissandro Guzman, who said in a statement: I feel very content and with all my heart I hope the bill that carries my son\u0027s name gets passed so it can prevent situations like this from happening again and so we can create more security for our beloved children.”If passed, businesses that fails to “provide a safe refuge for a child who had physical injury inflicted upon him or is in imminent danger of such injury until authorities arrive,” would face penalties.In the wake of Junior’s murder much of the anger was directed at the bodega, where he had sought refuge from the gang members. Surveillance footage from inside the Cruz and Chiky Grocery store showed the moment he rushed\u0026nbspinto the store and jumped over the counter.Store owner Modesto Cruz said at the time that he tried to help the teen by letting him hide behind the counter, but the gang threatened him.World news in picturesHugo Lloris lifts the trophy after France beat Croatia 4-2 in the World Cup final in the Luzhniki Stadium in RussiaGermany\u0027s Angelique Kerber beat seven-time champion US player Serena Williams in the Wimbledon final.

We need a people’s vote on the Brexit deal, with the option to stay in the EU.”Ports and airports around the Continent that see heavy traffic from Britain are currently in the process of overhauling their infrastructure to cope with Brexit. In the Netherlands, the port of Rotterdam and Schiphol airport have announced major investment programmes, with the Dutch government hiring 750 new customs officials.Preparations in the UK itself are taking place at a slower pace, however. In Kent,\u0026nbspholding areas to cater for lorries queueing\u0026nbspto pass extra checks have been proposed in case\u0026nbspof a “no deal”\u0026nbspscenario in March\u0026nbsp– but are lagging well behind schedule.This is concrete evidence of the lengthy and costly delays that will be caused by BrexitThough it is best known to British travellers as the terminus of the cross-channel train, Gare du Nord is also the home of intercity TGV services to the north of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, as well as services to Paris’s suburbs.The redevelopment of the station is planned to be completed before 2024, when Paris is set to host the Olympics. SNCF says the wider redevelopment will accommodate passenger growth and also transform the surrounding district of Paris.Last month\u0026nbspThe Independent revealed Germany’s state rail operator, Deutsche Bahn, had shelved advanced proposals to run high-speed services between London and Frankfurt, citing a significantly changed economic environment. The company said it would not comment on whether Brexit had played a part in its decision.Eurostar has faced challenges with border control arrangements at Amsterdam and Rotterdam, where it has just started running services. Passengers currently have to change at Brussels for checks on the return journey because Amsterdam station lacks the right facilities: UK authorities require stations to have dedicated platforms physically walled off from others, as if they were a national border.\u0026nbspThese physical changes to stations are not always possible and require significant investment that limits the ability to trial new routes.\u0026nbspBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Loneliest chimpanzee in the world hugs woman as he finally has company                New home fit for a KingElephants were shot for target practice by rival armies and their tusks sold to buy weapons.Inside Botswana, legal protection and the presence of a military task force has defended the herds from poachers, while also seeing Botswana enhance its reputation as one the best places to enjoy wildlife safaris.As elephant numbers increase so has the conflict between the animals and small-scale farmers. Maize crop yields in the Chobe district have plunged by as much as 72 per cent as the herds raid fields.Botswana\u0026rsquos parliament has now passed a motion to review the ban on elephant hunting imposed by former president Ian Khama, introduced in 2014 after surveys warned of declining wildlife populations.Botswana boasts the largest elephant population in AfricaFour years on and incumbent president Mokgweetsi Masisi is said to have signalled his support to lift the hunting ban.Public meetings are being arranged to discuss the controversial issue which is bound to attract heavy criticism from wildlife conservationists globally.Konstantinos Markus, a member of parliament from the wildlife-rich northwestern part of Botswana, explained the impact elephants are having on people\u0026rsquos lives.He said: \u0026ldquoCommunities have become very hostile and negative towards wildlife.These incredible pictures show some of the worlds most beautiful but vulnerable creatures - teetering on the brink extinction, including British butterfly, Small Copper.

The human population is estimated at 2.25 million.Mike Chase, a scientist with conservation group Elephants Without Borders, a conservation organisation, explained how reintroducing trophy hunting would have little impact on the elephant numbers or crop destruction.He said: \u0026ldquoHunting occurs in the dry season and targets large bulls, while elephant crop raiding coincides with the rainy season and the perpetrators tend to be young bulls or family herds.\u0026ldquoThe variation in the timing, space use, age and sex of problem elephants suggest hunting will have a limited effect on solving human-elephant conflict.This autumn sees Britain hosting a global summit on wildlife crime with the plight of elephants expected to feature high on the agenda.Every day 100 elephants are poached in Africa for their tusks, with a pound of illegal ivory worth around \u0026pound1,000 on the black markets of the Far East."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/128/590x/989612_1.jpg","title":"dog leopard sadgorod zoo russia animals nature","story":"CEN@zoopark_vlDog treats leopard cub as one of its ownAccording to reports, the dogs\u0027 owner was offered the leopard cub when its mother, called Alyona, rejected it and the zoo needed to find another home.This happened the day after the owner\u0027s iel Sherry gave birth to six puppies.Zoo head Sergey Asnovin told local media: This is the second time the leopardess refused to feed her young.Last year he had to give a leopard cub to the owner of a golden retriever that willingly became a foster mother to the young feline.Asnovin added: There were other times when Alyona ate her cubs and we did not even get the chance to see them.

For Simon, the death of his wife felt like a physical illness and being in intensive care.He decided to leave his job at Sky Sports to be with Ethan full time and they now both have an unbreakable bond.Simon is obviously very ­protective of his young son, but that works both ways.Ethan will often tell his dad that he is OK even when he is really suffering and missing his mum, because he doesn’t want Simon to worry about him, or to add to his dad’s pain.He sounds like a remarkable young lad who is a credit to both of his parents.For Simon, one of the worst things about Gemma’s death is the acute loneliness.After he has put Ethan to bed and he is in the living room, there’s no Gemma on the sofa watching TV or just chatting about the mundane events of the day.He often breaks down while making dinner for two rather than three, or emptying the dishwasher or doing other household tasks they used to share but that he now has to do by himself.It’s those little things that bind us together, and that we miss so very much.Simon told me that there are those who have simply not been in touch since Gemma died. It’s not because they don’t care, but because they just don’t know what to say to him and Ethan.It was interesting to hear him say that the most comforting sympathy he received was from a woman he bumped into in the supermarket, who knew Gemma from meeting her at the school gate.She simply told him that it was “utter crap, totally unfair and completely f*****g hellish”.And it is.When someone you love dies, it is utterly s**t and it does no harm to say that.Telling a bereaved person you are sorry for their “loss” is well meaning and comes with the best possible intentions, but we “lose” car keys, credit cards and dog leads.Those we loved are ripped from our arms and our hearts and it feels like the end of the world.Those feelings don’t really ever go away — you just somehow learn to live with them.We need to somehow try to make that process more bearable. So don’t avoid a devastated husband, a mother whose child has died or an elderly widow who is mourning her soul-mate.Talk to them and check in with them, because one day you will need them to comfort you.Essie, portrayed by Kaye Wragg, above, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and had to undergo a complete hysterectomy, giving her no chance of ever having a much-yearned-for child of her own.Kaye gave her usual cracking performance, utterly believable and deeply moving. This storyline will have helped raise awareness of a cancer that is known as the “silent killer”.I hope we see more of Essie, as I always looked upon her as the quiet heart of Holby.If you missed this episode, make sure you go to the BBC iPlayer to catch up.WE’VE all had them – those house guests who overstay their welcome and are a complete pain in the bum.The disgruntled visitors who don’t like the food and complain the bed is too hard and won’t do a hand’s turn to help with the dishes or buy the odd loaf or bottle of wine.The ones where you do a jig when they have left and vow: “Never again.”So I sympathise with poor Mr and Mrs May, who have been putting up with the Trumps – veritable guests from hell.He’s the worst possible bullying boaster and you can imagine him dominating the conversation and being demanding and boorish.She has all the personality of a fembot and looks bored and disinterested at all times.Having the Trumps to stay was never going to be the easiest of rides for our PM and her husband.Aside from the thorny political discussions – and this week he has ripped up the rulebook and sold her down the river – there’s the distressing business of making small talk with this odd couple.I can just imagine Donald blowharding and manaplaining over pre- dinner drinks while poor Theresa becomes even more strained and develops a red stress rash on her neck.Her hubby Philip probably ended up talking to Melania about the weather.Trump has to be kept entertained like some bored little emperor, but you don’t want him to have too good a time that he will want to visit again soon.It’s a thorny one.Theresa has had the toughest of times recently, but she is made of strong stuff. While she might look a little tired around the eyes, our PM is no quitter – unlike the men who have let her down and put their own interests above those of the country.It might be trivial but I hope our PM can take some comfort in the fact she looked sensational in that sizzling red dress she wore to greet Trump.Theresa won the style battle with much younger ex-model Melania, who looked like a cut-price Belle from Disney’s Beauty And The Beast.Although Trump got it spot on as the Beast.FOR once this week, it wasn’t some poor actress who’d eaten a bowl of pasta for lunch and had a small, rounded belly being body-shamed.Russell Crowe was the subject of gleeful mirth by people who feel better about themselves by mocking others.Admittedly, the former buff star of Gladiator has piled on the pounds and looks like Thomas Markle’s older, larger brother. But by all accounts he’s chunked up for a movie role.Gladiator was 18 years ago and even Hollywood stars grow older and bigger. It appears, however, that equality in Tinseltown now means both women AND men being derided for not remaining visions of perfection and having the audacity to age.TODAY Serena Williams strides on to Centre Court to play for her eighth Wimbledon Ladies singles title.I have never seen a more majestic athlete on a tennis court since the heady days of my girl crush, Martina Navratilova.Serena is simply sensational and being a mother has made her even more hungry to win.It’s astonishing to think that just ten months ago, after the traumatic birth of her daughter and following multiple surgeries, she could hardly walk.Despite all she has gone through, I’ve never seen any athlete better prepared physically but also mentally.Serena can taste that title and no one is going to get in her way.I don’t envy her opponent, Angelique Kerber, today as it’s not just Wimbledon up for grabs.Serena also has her 24th singles grand slam in her sights, which would equal the record set by Margaret Court.Mrs Court was a hell of a tennis player but, as it turns out, not a great human being.She is a self-styled pastor in Australia and her views on gay rights and same-sex marriage are deeply distasteful.She claimed transgender children are the work of the devil, leading Martina Navratilova to label her “racist and homophobic”.So for that and so many other reasons, I’m firmly backing Serena today.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was also Donald Trump’s view in The Sun.But yesterday the PM convinced him otherwise. And she insisted “there will be no limit to the possibility of us doing trade deals around the world”.How are both positions possible? How will we enjoy such flexibility?How will our courts be supreme if we still heed ECJ rulings? How will we have total control of immigration if some EU workers can still come in as they see fit? And what will she do next if Brussels rejects it all?Leave voters’ rising anger is fuelled by the suspicion that behind the repeated assurances we are being stitched up.Mrs May must explain why we’re not. Explain how she talked round a doubting Trump. Explain how we will seize the opportunities Brexit presents. If she wants to admit her plan isn’t ideal but it’s the best there is, this is her moment.It’s time for honesty, not spin. The PM owes it to Britain. DO Remainers really not get the difference between President Obama giving his view on Brexit and President Trump doing so?Obama was egged on by Downing Street in 2016 to try to skew a democratic vote in favour of one side. He told us, falsely, that backing Brexit would put us last in the queue for a US trade deal.Trump’s argument in The Sun two years AFTER the vote was simply that Leave won and he doubted Mrs May’s strategy would fulfil on the verdict.He may be wrong. But Obama definitely was. Because once Trump replaced him, Britain hit the front of the US queue — a position only now threatened by staying tied to Brussels.Happy to help, Remain fans. WE wondered if President Trump might try to shoot the messenger when he realised how embarrassing his world exclusive Sun interview was to his host Mrs May.We’re used to that, of course. We’re not as used to seeing Mr Trump have the grace to back down when one of his “fake news” jibes is proved wrong, as it was yesterday.That’s not just a special moment. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In pubs, in shop windows, on cars, on scaffolding, on hats and shirts and flying above 10 Downing Street.And nobody was sneering at our flag now. Just guessing, but I doubt if anyone will be sneering at that flag any time soon.Not even Labour’s Emily Thornberry.What a ride. What a month-long high. What an adventure for those of us who are old enough to remember 1966 and also for the children who will remember this as the first World Cup they watched.Fifty years from today, those kids will still remember how they felt when England won a penalty shootout against Colombia, and when Kieran Trippier bent it better than Beckham after five minutes against Croatia.And they will remember to their dying day exactly what it felt like when we knew that England was not going to the final.The tears are real but so is the pride. And the pride — even more than the disappointment — is the overwhelming emotion today.England played with big hearts, true grit and the fearlessness of youth.They come home not as legends to rival the boys of 1966 but with their heads held high. Their nation is proud of them.And yes, it is only a game. It is not a war. Nobody died.But at a time when our nation is more horribly divided than at any time in modern history, we were reminded what a great country this still is, and how much we have to be proud of, and how much there is to love.And it was not your imagination — England was united once again.“Our country has been through difficult times in terms of unity,” said England’s young manager in his thoughtful, softly spoken manner.“Sport — football in particular — has the power to help that.“We’re a team that, with our diversity and our youth, represents modern England.In England, we have spent a bit of time being a bit lost as to what our modern identity is. I think we represent that modern identity and hopefully people can connect with us.”Gareth Southgate is right about the healing power of sport. This World Cup brought us together in a way we’ve not experienced since the London 2012 Olympics.But 2012 was before the bitter wounds of Brexit.It is Gareth Southgate himself who is the main reason this country has rallied around this England team.Southgate with his courtesy, his decency and his Yoda-like intelligence.Southgate,  who talks about “owning the process” and “managing our energy” — it is quite difficult to imagine the former England manager, Big Sam Allardyce, being comfortable with that kind of 21st Century dialogue. Southgate with his dapper shirt, tie and waistcoat combo, as suave as a suburban James Bond.Southgate who carries himself as if he is the living embodiment of Rudyard Kipling’s most famous poem.“If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those imposters just the same . . . you will be a man, my son!”Even as England were celebrating their very first win in a World Cup penalty shootout, Southgate took time to comfort Mateus Uribe, one of the two Colombian players who had missed their penalty.This was more than an act of sportsmanship. It was an act of humanity.Because we all knew that Southgate has been there.The abiding memory of Gareth Southgate as a player — the one moment that everyone remembers — is in Euro 1996, with his shoulders sagging inside a grey England shirt and his spirit smashed after missing a penalty (we never recall the players who were too cowardly to step up and take a penalty — history gives them a pass).Stuart “Psycho” Pearce had known penalty redemption — missing in Italia 1990 but scoring in Euro 1996. Southgate’s redemption has been infinitely more convoluted.There was an image that went viral of the 25-year-old Gareth Southgate after just missing a penalty in 1996 being comforted by the 47-year-old Gareth Southgate who shook up the world in Russia in 2018.If this World Cup has gone some way to healing our divided nation, it has also gone a long way to healing the pain that Southgate has endured for half a lifetime.It is true what they say ­— success is not final, failure is not fatal.The manager was well served by this young team, who were light years away from the central casting image of the Premier League footballer — the pampered, wag-shagging, blingtastic, Bentley-crashing, multi-millionaire airhead.These England footballers — even the star striker, Harry Kane, who would cost a minimum £100million if Real Madrid came knocking — were clearly of and from the working class.They hail, every one of them, from modest beginnings. Most of the squad — 15 — paid their Premier League dues while out on loan in the lump-kicking lower leagues.“Barnsley, Leeds, Bolton, Blackburn,” said Southgate. “We’re lads who have come from those places.”This England team are not ordinary boys — they are elite professional athletes — but they have all been ordinary boys, and there was a humility about them, a work ethic and total lack of pretension that made you believe they will never forget their roots.And if they come from everywhere from the North East to Yorkshire to the Essex/East End borders, they also come from every kind of family.There were those who grew up in solid nuclear families with both mum and dad and siblings present, and those who were raised by single mums, and those who are from domestic chaos.Raheem Sterling’s father was murdered in Jamaica when he was two, and Dele Alli escaped the turmoil of his riven family life by moving in with his best friend’s family when he was 13.Their backstories are as diverse as our nation, but every one of them has grafted to get to the top.Sterling was berated for having an assault rifle tattooed on his leg but nobody ran harder or longer for the England cause than Raheem.When you watched his mesmeric, lung-busting runs, how could you not warm to him?How could you not forgive one dumb tatt?“Good lads,” said Southgate of his England squad, those boys from the Mersey and the Thames and the Tyne, from Bury and Leeds and Sheffield, and once again he said it all.They are good lads and we cheered them, and celebrated with them, and in the end, we shared their pain because it was our pain too, even in defeat against Belgium yesterday.They were a band of brothers and for one magical sun-drenched summer month, they lit up our nation.This World Cup was a roller-coaster ride that grabbed you by the scruff of your replica Three Lions shirt from the first match against Tunisia and refused to let go until the end of extra time against Croatia.They came SO CLOSE — Croatia led England for 11 minutes.That’s how agonisingly near we were to saying, “Bonjour, Monsieur,” in today’s World Cup final.It was gloriously entertaining, but it was also far more than just entertainment.It felt like Gareth Southgate and that young England team represented the very best of us.We learned — or we were reminded — that decency is not weakness, sportsmanship is not soft, and you need never feel one twinge of shame if you give your all.And we learned that we love our national game with a passion that can never be denied.I honestly thought we would win it.Typical England fan!I believed that this was the year we added the second World Cup winner’s gold star to the team shirt.When the England players were chucking around rubber chickens at a training session just before the Croatia semi-final, I thought it was a tension-busting masterstroke.It wasn’t to be.But this England team have been through the full range of human emotions — from joy to despair, hope to disappointment, and this country has been with them every step of the way.The struggle continues, the dream will never die.I reckon 50,000 England football fans will already be making plans to go to Qatar in 2022.This World Cup will be remembered for breaking our hearts and uniting our nation.And a grateful, emotionally exhausted country has just two words for those Three Lions.Thank you. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One able to set its own laws and control its borders.The idea of taking diktats from European courts, having no border control, and being unable to strike free trade deals — while paying Brussels £39billion — is not the Brexit people voted for.Mrs May should look at our poll today to see the bloody nose the Tories could be dealt at the next General Election.Unless she starts being honest with the country, then she will cause further disillusionment among voters, potentially opening the door to Jeremy Corbyn…Ushering in Britain’s first Marxist PM should not be a legacy Mrs May wants. EXPECTATIONS were not high before the World Cup began — for once.With the pressure lifted off the players’ shoulders — combined with Gareth Southgate’s leadership — our boys played with passion and determination.Despite yesterday’s loss to Belgium, they were real ambassadors for England.Meanwhile, the FA are set to apply for the 2030 World Cup. Good. About time.The tournament will mark a century since the first one in Uruguay.

Im like what is this tic tac on the floor.Well guess the f** what. It wasn’t a tic tac. It was a maggot. Then I really open my eyes. Maggot. Maggot. Maggot. Hundreds of maggots it seems.

The tweet has since been deleted.The American businessman then attacked the 63-year-old expat claiming he never saw him at the cave during the high-profile rescue mission.When asked about Musks outrageous comments, Unsworth said today: I believe he has called me a paedophile.Well, by definition, you’re rescuing 12 young boys, by definition that puts everybody in the same context.He revealed he is now considering legal action against Musk adding I think people realise what sort of guy he is.“There is no justification. At the end of the day we were here to rescue these young boys,”added.Unsworth said he had saved copies of Musk’s tweets  - seen by many of his 22m followers - and believed he had “lost the plot”.“I have a lot of support from people around the world astonished by his unfounded comments,” he told the .“I don’t know the guy, never met the guy, and don’t want to meet the guy,” he said of Musk.The caver said he would make a decision on legal action when he flies back to the UK this week, but said the episode with Musk aint finished.Hes just a PR stunt merchant - thats all he is, Unsworth added.Vernons elderly mother, who lives in Essex, also hit out at Musks slur.Vera Unsworth, 88, said: “That’s stupid, that is the last thing he is.  It’s disgusting, absolutely disgusting that. He wants his mouth taped up.I don’t know if Vernon will seek legal recourse, if he has any sense he will. It’s disgusting coming from a millionaire as well.“He probably thinks money doesn’t hurt him and he can get away with anything. I hope he does take legal action but the point will be he has got the money and Vernon hasn’t.Social media users have now expressed their outrage over Musks comments.One person tweeted: I used to admire #elonmusk and what he contributes to technology, calling another person a pedo without proof is disgusting.Another said: The implication that the only reason someone would be an expat in Thailand is because theyre a pedo is so offensive on so many levels. An insult to Thailand and its wonderful people.Claus Rasmussen, a Danish instructor at Blue Label Diving in Phuket, called the attack “inappropriate” and praised Unsworth’s rescue role: “He was the guy who effectively mapped most of that cave.”The Brit, who co-led the operation to save the schoolboys from the cave, sparked the tirade when he told CNN Musks sub plan  had absolutely no chance of working.The submarine, I believe, was about five-foot-six long, rigid, so it wouldnt have gone round any corners or any obstacles, he said.In a string of tweets responding to a journalist mentioning Mr Unsworths comments, Musk said: Never saw this British expat guy who lives in Thailand (sus) at any point when we were in the caves.Only people in sight were the Thai navy/army guys, who were great. Their navy seals escorted us in - total opposite of wanting us to leave.Water level was actually very low \u0026amp still (not flowing) - you could have literally swum into Cave 5 with no gear, which is obv how kids got in. If not true, then I challenge this dude to show final rescue video.Huge credit to pump and generator team. Unsung heroes here.You know what, dont even bother showing the video. We will make one of the mini-sub/pod going all the way to Cave 5 no problemo.Mr Unsworth spent years exploring the Tham Luang cave system where the boys were trapped for 17 days, meaning he had expert knowledge that was vital to the rescue.He acquired his love of potholing in the Yorkshire Dales and was the first foreign rescuer at the scene.The expat told the Sunday Times: “The search was going nowhere, the conditions were worsening by the hour and we had no idea where the boys were.“We needed the expertise of top world-class cave divers to look for these kids and we needed it fast. If we hadn’t called them in then, it would have been too late.”Unsworth knew some of the chambers where they might have sought refuge would by then have been completely flooded.“If they’d been caught in the wrong place, they’d have stood no chance,” he said as he reflected on the operation.Unsworth, who is not a diver, was among the teams that carried stretchers during the three-day operation. He was among the last to leave the cave on Tuesday night.A former Thai Navy SEAL died while working to rescue the boys. Samarn Kunan ran out of oxygen while attempting to return to the command centre. He was 38.A Buddhist cleansing ceremony and memorial service was held in his honour in Chiang Rai province earlier today.Asked about Musks plan for the mini submarine,  rescue divers Richard Stanton told This Morning: We werent totally convinced.We had a plan, but it was always worth thinking of backup plans in case ours wasnt viable.What was telling was weve never really seen this machine, it was on-site but it has never been shown to us to evaluate, so I cant really comment on how useful it would have been.Musk was earlier mocked online after the lads were rescued from the caves without the help of his submarine, he has now hit back claiming the dive teams encouraged him to continue the work.Earlier Musk tweeted a screenshot of an email from Stanton who co-lead the rescue dive team telling him it was absolutely worth continuing with the developments of the submarine.He claimed Mr Stanton was the actual expert in the rescue rather than Mr Unsworth and that he was told his submarine may well be used."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000162755476.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"hatton garden brian reader free","story":"The 79-year-old — leader of the gang of villains dubbed the Diamond Wheezers — left Belmarsh prison in London last week.Reader, who has suffered prostate cancer and a series of strokes, was released with remission after half of the six-year, three-month sentence he got for the £14million safe dep­osit box centre break-in.He has since been enjoying the summer sunshine in the garden of his home in Dartford, Kent, alongside relatives and friends.He was also driven on outings in his son Paul’s red ­Porsche sports car.But there was anger he was not kept in jail over the millions of pounds worth of gems, bullion and cash still outstanding.Reader had faced a further seven-year term if he could not pay a £6.5million confiscation ord­er imp­osed on him and three other ringleaders of the 2015 Easter bank holiday heist.He should have faced a return to jail at the end of this month when the pay-back time limit expires.But the villain has been given leave by the Court of Appeal to ­challenge the order and it is understood he will remain free until that is settled.No date has been set for an appeal hearing.Former Flying Squad commander John O’Connor said: “He ruined people’s lives and until he pays back that money, or tells the police what happened to it, he should stay in jail.”Due to his health, Reader received a sentence seven months shorter than his fellow Hatton Garden ringleaders.Last year he appeared in court in a wheelchair for a confiscation hearing — and he still walks aided by sticks.A family member said this year: “He can’t see properly, can’t hear, he is very weak and is down to 8st.”One source said of his release: “Brian is hugely relieved to be out and believed he’d die inside.He’s not a well man but is taking one day at a time and enjoying himself with his family.”GOT a story?

It seems they are gearing up.”The cap, backed by The Sun’s People Power energy campaign, would place a ceiling on an estimated 11million so-called standard variable tariffs (SVTs) for up to five years.In the letter seen by the Sun, Ms Perry tells the Big Six: “Value, choice and excellent consumer service should be at the heart of this.“Sadly,  it is evident that for many consumers that has not been the case.“The Government will strongly condemn any efforts to frustrate the process of putting the cap in place. Digging in to defend a hold on legacy customer groups and out-of-date practices, rather than embracing change, will only harm loyal customers. And it risks damaging the reputation of the whole sector.”A source added: “Ministers and the public will not stand for any supplier who tries to hold this up.“Suppliers should see the writing on the wall and help make this work.”The Sun demanded a crackdown on the Big Six two years ago when we revealed their SVTs were ripping off families by nearly £400 a year.Business Secretary Greg Clark accused the energy giants of “milking” millions of loyal, older customers so it could launch cut-price online deals.Iain Conn, head of British Gas-owner Centrica, blamed the price cap for 4,000 job cuts in February and has been an outspoken critic of the legislation.The Big Six have incensed critics by raising prices despite the planned cap.EDF announced a six per cent hike for electricity and gas prices last week — its second of the year.There are fears that the Big Six could drag the process out by taking legal action. They need to realise that they’ve been caught with their hands in the cookie jar and take their punishment.The Government must see this one through to the end.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is not going to be a second referendum under any circumstances.The spokesman said Mrs May was very clear that the proposal we put forward at Chequers delivers on the will of the people in the referendum.Yesterday the former Prime Minister Tony Blair backed a similar three-optioned plan, describing the plan as a mush and the worst of both worlds.He said: This is where True remainers and true leavers make common cause.Ms Greenings comments comes with Theresa May facing open rebellion from the other end of the Conservative party - as Eurosceptics threaten to bring down the PM over her soft Brexit vision.Meanwhile, Mrs Mays allies have launched a frantic bid to shore up her premiership - as party chiefs rang around grassroots activists and Tory members who are livid with her plans.Ms Greening - who quit the Cabinet in January after being moved from her Education brief - says that it will be “unacceptable” for MPs to impose a compromise on the electorate.She said voters should be presented with three choices - the prime minister’s negotiated deal, staying in the EU or a clean break.Ms Greening is said to have the support of other Remain-backing Tories including Amber Rudd, the former home secretary.Today chief Remainer rebel Dominic Grieve also wrote in support of Britain changing its mind on Brexit.Although he admits that the PMs deal is far from ideal, in an article for the Evening Standard he wrote: In a deeply divided country we must either work together to get the best deal we can — and this needs compromise — or accept that Brexit cannot be implemented and think again about what we are doing.Last night at least 20 Eurosceptic Tory MPs said they were ready to flout Downing Street and back four “rebel” amendments to the Government’s Customs Bill in the Commons today.One furious MP said: “Theresa May had the chance to be the Prime Minister who delivered Brexit. Now she’s the Prime Minister who f***** it up.”Separately, the PM suffered her eighth resignation in nine days as Robert Courts, the successor to David Cameron in Witney, Oxon, quit as a ministerial aide in protest at her Brexit plan.And in his most savage attack yet, hardliner Jacob Rees-Mogg branded the PM a “Remainer who has remained a Remainer”.Ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was said to be weighing up whether to pile on pressure with a dramatic resignation speech on Wednesday. Last night he called on Britain to “believe in itself after Brexit” in his first public comments since resigning.He wrote in the  that the nation should “rediscover the spirit of dynamism” from the Victorian era.Mr Johnson resigned as Foreign Secretary a week ago along with Brexit Secretary David Davis over Theresa May’s Brexit plans."},{"url":null,"title":"children left tears theme park dinosaur day one t rex","story":"Outraged parents bombarded Funland At The Tropicanas Facebook page with angry messages following the free one-day event on Saturday.The event had been billed as a day of everything dinosaur related - but transport issues meant a large part of the exhibition had not arrived at the Weston-Super-Mare attraction.The ad for the event read: Come and join us for a day of everything Dinosaur related with lots to see and do!Mum Charlene Harris said: Dinosaur Day suggests more than one dinosaur!

The Prime Minister tonight mounted a major climbdown on her plan for leaving the EU - by accepting Hard Brexiteer demands to change it. She accepted amendments to the Customs Bill including one that would make part of her plan, collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU, illegal. It was thought this could hurl the Prime Minister back to the drawing board. Yet Downing Street insisted the amendments were consisted with her plan. Meanwhile top Tory Justine Greening called for a second referendum as PM was battered by MPs on both sides of the debate.  Mrs May\u0027s Brexit plan, agreed at Chequers and laid out in a White Paper, will see Britain share EU rules on goods imports - a major step towards Soft Brexit. But it managed to enrage both Brexiteers, who say it\u0027s a betrayal, and Remainers, who say it doesn\u0027t go far enough. It prompted the resignation of Leave-backing Tory members of the government, right from Cabinet level to the lowly \u0027bag-carrier\u0027, the Parliamentary Private Secretary. Here\u0027s the full list of resignations that put such intense pressure on the PM.   DATE: July 8 RESIGNED AS: Brexit Secretary WHAT HE SAID: The inevitable consequence of the proposed policies will be to make the supposed control by Parliament illusory rather than real. The national interest requires a Secretary of State that is an enthusiastic believer in your approach, and not merely a reluctant conscript.   DATE: July 8 RESIGNED AS: Brexit Minister WHAT HE SAID: I acknowledge the Parliamentary opinion and arithmetic which constrain the Government’s freedom of action but I cannot support this policy with the sincerity and resolve which will be necessary. I therefore write with regret to resign from the Government. 3. Boris Johnson   DATE: July 9 RESIGNED AS: Foreign Secretary WHAT HE SAID: Brexit should be about opportunity and hope. It should be a chance to do things differently, to be more nimble and dynamic, and to maximise the particular advantages of the UK as an open outward-looking global economy. That dream is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt.   DATE: July 9 RESIGNED AS: PPS at the Transport Department WHAT HE SAID: The direction the negotiations had been taking have suggested that we would not really leave the EU and the conclusion and statements following the Chequers summit conﬁrmed my fears.  5. Conor Burns     DATE: July 9 RESIGNED AS: PPS to Boris Johnson WHAT HE SAID: I\u0027ve decided it\u0027s time to have greater freedom. I want to see the referendum result respected. And there are other areas of policy I want to speak more openly on. 6. Maria Caulfield   DATE: July 10 RESIGNED AS: Vice chair of the Conservative Party WHAT SHE SAID: This policy will be bad for our country and bad for the party.

But you\u0027ll need a lot more than protests to get rid of the obese orange loofah, who\u0027s just announced he will run for a second term. Because his time in office is not as limited as you might think.  The generally-accepted truth is that US presidents can serve only two terms of 4 years each. But this is not a rule. It\u0027s a convention, underpinned by the 22nd amendment to the US Constitution. And that amendment actually limits the time in office to a theoretical 10 years, if someone wanted to push it by replacing another president for 2 years less one day. And while you\u0027re struggling with the idea of a whole decade of Trump, consider this - an amendment can be amended.  Now, it\u0027s a tricky business. And if you\u0027re one of those who hates Trump and pays attention to history, you\u0027ll be about to zip down to the comments and talk about constitutional checks and balances, how it must get through Congress, he can\u0027t even get the wall paid for, Foxy you have taken leave et cetera. But if there\u0027s one thing the Republican Party has shown so far, it\u0027s that they are prepared to let Trump do almost what he pleases if it keeps them in power. Only a few have resigned on principle, only a few state publicly he\u0027s a fool, and by and large they have flown in his slipstream in return for undoing all those abortion laws, tax regulations and other things they dislike. The Democrats, meanwhile, are disorganised. There\u0027s no credible leader, no unifying message, no prospective opponent to dismantle Trump\u0027s edifice of bulls***.  Which means he heads into the November mid-terms in first place with every chance of more power in Congress. Every single House of Representatives seat is up for grabs, along with a third of the Senate - most of them Democrats.   Don\u0027t talk to me of your Russia investigation, or your federal and state probes into witness tampering or campaign funding or who did what when.  Not only has Trump managed to devalue them by doing even worse things in public - telling Canada to piss off, stepping on the Queen, trying to destroy NATO - they\u0027ll take years to grind through the US legal system.   Donald Trump lied or misled you at least 5 times in his interview with Piers Morgan  Already this year Trump\u0027s used the power of presidential pardon to free a former Republican aide who obstructed justice. Last year he pardoned a sheriff who rounded up migrants without any reasonable suspicion of a crime, and who had been convicted for contempt of court.  His aides have been discussing in public Trump\u0027s legal power even to pardon himself, and he\u0027s just about to make the Supreme Court an ultra-Conservative arbitrator of his actions. So if Russian collusion, or any other of the numerous crimes his team have been accused of, get as far as the Chief Oompah-Loompah there\u0027s no guarantee that the mud will stick.  US politics has a history of non-adhesive mud.  We\u0027re still looking at an absolute maximum of 10 years, right? Not necessarily. If he doesn\u0027t amend the amendment, he can find ways around it. There is precedent for the imposition of martial law, suspension of the US constitution and even getting the same result without actually having to do either, by asking Congress to approve it and them being terrified enough to do as requested.  Donald Trump says he intends to run for re-election in 2020 - and doesn\u0027t think ANYONE can beat him  Abraham Lincoln did it in 1861 at the outbreak the American Civil War. Congress approved of all his measures - including giving the military the power of arrest and summary trial - without any official declarations.  Dear old Donald only this week compared himself to Honest Abe, claiming he had better polling than the bearded abolitionist even though there was no such polling in his lifetime.  That\u0027s before we move on to the Founding Fathers, those men who led the War of Independence and framed the constitution so there could be no more tyranny. They were quite keen on the idea of a president-for-life and didn\u0027t want term limits in the first place.  So now we have a definite 4 years of Trump that looks likely to be 8, with a possible extension until 2026. You have a lack of credible opposition, and criminal investigations that won\u0027t bear fruit for a long time.  On top of that we have an obvious route for a PR campaign invoking the spirit of the Benjamin Franklin, George Washington and Abe Lincoln, and a constitution which states in Article 1, section 9: The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.  Now, is there any sort of invasion or rebellion Mr Trump might like to get people worried about?  Mexicans, protesters, Muslims, women, and immigrants of hues other than white all seem to exist in greater numbers, and more volume, than Mr Trump seems to like. You can see him typing the tweet, can\u0027t you?    All we have left to wonder is whether or not this man, who lied about his height in order to pretend he is not morbidly-obese and worries what you think of his tiny hands, is vain enough to WANT to stay in office forever.  Well, in 2016 while running for office he told a rally in Ohio: I’m just thinking to myself right now: we should just cancel the election and just give it to Trump, right? What are we even having it for?  And in March, after meeting President Xi Jinping a month after a successful campaign to change the Chinese term-limit laws, Trump announced: He\u0027s now president for life. President for life. No, he\u0027s great. And look, he was able to do that. I think it\u0027s great. Maybe we\u0027ll have to give that a shot some day.  He was joking both times, of course. But then he was joking about Barack Obama\u0027s birth certificate, and joking about a wall, and joking about running for president - once. If you joke about something shocking, actually doing it then seems less bad.

The rogue US President abused the Prime Minister’s hospitality and brought tens of thousands of protesters on to the streets. His rudeness and lies are the toxic ravings of an unstable man-child and reinforce the need for Britain to stay close to our European allies. May’s disclosure that the advice from the deranged six-time bankrupt manchild in the White House was the infeasible suing of the EU was her way of letting us know even she thinks unhinged Trump’s a turkey leg short of the full Thanksgiving feast. Downing Street, desperate to avoid May falling, is pitching the line that it’s her Brexit or no Brexit at all, plus Prime Minister Jeremy Corbyn. Tory hardline Brextremists led by Boris Johnson – who was laughed at by MPs as they watched him search in vain for the Foreign Office limo he lost on quitting – are gauging their ability to knock May over.  What’s clear from her controversial 98-page Brexit white paper is that she finally recognises European reality trumps American free trade fantasies. Britain would be poorer and weaker, stripped of influence and with its sovereignty eroded should she triumph. Our current membership of the European club is superior to any Leave option. Behind the meaningless “Brexit means Brexit” propaganda, May is acknowledging that sacrificing our manufacturing industry on the ideological altar of Brexit fanaticism would be ruinous. She’ll reduce national clout by pulling out of the Brussels institutions next March – and not travel very far.

The government has agreed to a series of amendments to the customs bill put forward by Jacob Rees-Mogg which are designed to impose strict conditions on the PM in negotiations with the EU. It comes after Theresa May produced a plan which would keep the UK closely tied to Brussels\u0027 rules on goods and food. A number 10 source said We have accepted the amendments because we believe its consistent with the approach that we set out.  The most contentious of these amendments would prevent the UK collecting duties for the EU unless Brussels agreed reciprocal arrangements.  The Brexiteers believe this would kill off the plan because the EU is highly unlikely to agree to that proposal.  The amendments were put forward by arch-Eurosceptics including Jacob Rees-Mogg, Sir Bernard Jenkin, Priti Patel and Iain Duncan Smith who are furious at the Chequers plan. Sir Bernard Jenkin told the World at One the Chequers plan was dead, with opposition from both wings of the Tory party. I\u0027m afraid it is neither beloved by Remainers or Leavers.  It\u0027s also quite likely to be either rejected by the EU or more demands will be made upon it so it will be even less acceptable. There were signs at Westminster that Mrs May could be prepared to compromise in an effort to avert a damaging blow to her authority. Mr Rees-Mogg, the leader of the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG), played down suggestions over the weekend they were seeking to topple Mrs May, saying she still had time to change course on her proposals. However, the danger to the Prime Minister was underlined by the disclosure that Brexiteers had set up a WhatsApp group to co-ordinate voting tactics, organised by ex-Brexit minister Steve Baker, who quit over the Chequers plan.  The Daily  reported more than 100 MPs had joined the group, more than double the 48 needed to submit letters of no confidence in the Prime Minister to force a leadership contest. A Brexiteer source said that while ministers haven\u0027t yet accepted the amendments all the noise is in that direction.  Brexit minister Suella Braverman told the World at One there were strong views but insisted: I don\u0027t think it\u0027s yet tearing the Conservative Party apart. We have got a plan, it\u0027s been approved by the Cabinet, it\u0027s now the policy and it\u0027s a starting point for the negotiations with the EU. It\u0027s a generous offer, it places the ball firmly in the EU\u0027s court and it\u0027s now incumbent on them to respond generously, pragmatically and favourably and we have to move forward with these negotiations. Asked if the Government would accept the European Research Group amendments to the Customs Bill, Mrs Braverman said: I\u0027m not privy to the discussions that are going on. But some of the proposed changes were not necessarily at odds with Government policy. North Cornwall MP Scott Mann quit as a ministerial aide to the Treasury, the former postman saying he would not deliver a watered down Brexit.  The threat from the Brexiteers is not the only danger facing Mrs May, with pro-EU Tories tabling amendments of their own to the customs bill and the Trade Bill, which returns to the Commons on Tuesday, which would keep Britain in a customs union with the EU.  It was unclear whether they will actually press them to a vote after some pro-EU MPs backed Mrs May\u0027s Chequers plan and EU white paper. However, in a sign of just how volatile the party has become, former education secretary Justine Greening, who backed Remain, denounced the plan, saying it offered the worst of both worlds and called for a second referendum.  The only solution is to take the final Brexit decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians, away from the backroom deals, and give it back to the people, she said in an article for The Times. The Prime Minister\u0027s official spokesman responded: The British public have voted to leave the European Union. There is not going to be a second referendum under any circumstances. The spokesman said Mrs May was very clear that the proposal we put forward at Chequers delivers on the will of the people in the referendum.

Other world leaders have been wrong-footed by Trump\u0027s style, where he yanks his sparring partner\u0027s hand towards him.  So it\u0027s no surprise the Russian President, whose regime is accused of a nerve agent murder on UK soil, came prepared today.

In the end it seemed Putin had nothing to fear as Trump was in good spirits - even appearing to give Putin a wink.

This is quite a feat, considering we\u0027ve only seen him in public twice.  The first occasion, memorably, was the day he was born. As was the case with Prince George and Princess Charlotte , the Cambridges posed for photos outside of the Lindo Wing with their new arrival.   Like his siblings, little Louis seemed completely unfased by all the attention and slept throughout his first photocall.  Since then, he\u0027s been kept out of the public eye by his parents, with his only other public outing being his christening last week.  Keen photographer Kate also took some adorable shots of her youngest child with his big sister Charlotte, which Kensington Palace shared.   Then, of course, we finally got a glimpse of the young prince at his christening. The palace also released a gorgeous selection of the official photos, but it may once again be a while until we see the youngster again.  So let\u0027s take a look back at what we\u0027ve seen of Prince Louis so far.  1. Prince Louis makes his debut on April 23  Louis Arthur Charles was safely delivered on April 23 - St George\u0027s Day - at the Lindo Wing of St Mary\u0027s hospital in Paddington. He was welcomed into the world at 11.01am by his parents, weighing a robust 8lbs 7oz. This makes him the heaviest at birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s children. Both George and Charlotte weighed 8lbs 3oz.   We had to wait a four days for his name to be announced - the longest wait for a royal baby name in years.  Then on Friday 27 April a statement released by Kensington Palace on Twitter read: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are delighted to announce that they have named their son Louis Arthur Charles. The baby will be known as His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge.   The name is steeped in history, and it is thought the infant was named in memory of Lord Louis Mountbatten, the last British Viceroy of India .  2. Duchess of Cambridge shares adorable snaps, May 5 We didn\u0027t have to wait long until we saw Louis again. Kensington Palace shared a tender moment snapped on Charlotte’s third birthday. The images sweetly mirrored ones (also taken by Kate) of George giving his little sister a kiss a few weeks after her birth in 2015.  Kensington Palace said William, 35, and Kate were very pleased to share the photographs. Staff said the royal couple “would like to thank members of the public for all of the kind messages they have received following the birth of Prince Louis, and for Princess Charlotte’s third birthday”. No idea where Prince George was hiding though...  3. Prince Louis\u0027 christening, July 9 While his brother and sister had starring roles at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s wedding, Louis was presumably kept at home. He was also nowhere to be seen at the Trooping the Colour either, so it was with anticipation that fans looked forward to the young royal\u0027s christening.  Royal babies tend to be christened two to three months after they\u0027re born. Prince George was born on July 22, 2013 and was christened three months and a day later on October 23. Princess Charlotte was born on May 2, 2015 and she was christened two months and three days later on July 5.  Louis\u0027 christening was the first time the public had seen the Cambridges as a family of five, and it took place in the Chapel Royal - where big brother George was christened. Charlotte was christened in the same church as Princess Diana.   As for godparents , Nicholas van Cutsem, Guy Pelly, Harry Aubrey-Fletcher, Lady Laura Meade, Hannah Carter and Lucy Middleton all made the cut.  With the exception of Lucy Middleton, who is Kate\u0027s cousin, the rest are close friends of the couple.  Kate and William have also released a beautiful collection of official photographs of their youngest to mark his christening. The official images were taken by British photographer Matt Holyoak at Clarence House after the christening had taken place.

Mia-Lili Bennett has not stopped crying since she saw the cruel Instagram poll. And her parents Corrinia Bennet, 33, and John Bennett, 42, are watching her around the clock because she keeps talking about \u0027ending it all.\u0027 The post featured a photo of Mia-Lili\u0027s face with the words \u0027who thinks she ugly\u0027 plastered over it - to which 53 per cent responded \u0027hell ya\u0027. Bullies created an account called puglife123456 under Mia-Lili\u0027s name to post the survey and a family friend alerted Corrinia to it last week. The mum-of-three, who lives in Norwich, Norfolk, claims she immediately reported the poll to Instagram who have removed the post.  Shocked by what she had seen, Corrinia then faced the devastating task of showing Mia-Lili the post to find out if she knew about it, leaving her blissfully unaware little girl in floods of tears and suicidal. Corrinia, customer experience assistant at a bookmakers, said: I was made aware that this post had been going round by a friend. I reported it straight away and so did a few other people. Instagram were really good and they have taken it down. But the next day I needed to wake up my daughter and ask her about it. I didn\u0027t want to show her but I needed to know what had been going on. She saw the post and just started crying. She cried so much she collapsed and her dad had to scoop her up off the floor. She hasn\u0027t stopped crying since and neither have I to be honest. We\u0027ve had to put her on suicide watch at home. Her dad and I have to make sure someone is with her 24 hours a day because she keeps talking about ending it all.  She had hairbands tied up in a hoop on her bed and I had to take them down because I was terrified what she might try to do. It\u0027s absolutely heartbreaking. I never thought I would be dealing with my daughter being a victim of cyber bullying at such a young age. They\u0027re still so innocent at this age. Even though you\u0027re always going to be there for your kids when something happens, you don\u0027t expect something this evil to happen. It\u0027s horrible. For someone to even think about being that malicious is horrendous. It has completely destroyed her confidence, she\u0027s very self-conscious about the way she looks. We tell her she\u0027s beautiful all the time but she won\u0027t believe it. After it happened, Mia-Lili felt so self-conscious she didn\u0027t want to go to school anymore but she went on Friday and she told me, \u0027I won\u0027t let them win\u0027. I\u0027m so proud of her. She has the kindest heart. She always gives homeless people her pocket money and if you ask her if she wants something from a shop she\u0027ll say she needs to get something for her dad and sisters first.  She\u0027s so willing to open her heart to people. Even if they\u0027re horrible to her she calls them her friends. I don\u0027t understand why they can\u0027t treat her with the same kindness. The mum also contacted Norfolk police to report the cyber bullying and says they were \u0027brilliant\u0027 at consoling Mia-Lili. A spokesman for Norfolk Constabulary confirmed the investigation is still ongoing. Without her mum\u0027s consent Mia-Lili set up an Instagram account at the beginning of June but confessed to Corrinia a couple of hours later. The mum told her daughter she was not allowed to have a social media account until she meets the required aged limits - with Instagram only allowing accounts for 13 year olds and over. Mia-Lili did as her mum asked and deleted the account but in the few hours it was live, someone got hold of the little girl\u0027s profile photo and turned it into a nasty poll. Since the incident Mia-Lili\u0027s mum, dad and sisters Lexi-May Bennett, nine, and Neave-Marie Bennett, four, are giving the schoolgirl as much love and support as possible.  And Corrinia is now urging all parents to watch their children\u0027s internet activity more diligently to ensure they don\u0027t become victims of online trolls. Corrinia said: When Mia-Lili told me she had set up an Instagram account, I told her straight away it needed to be taken down and uninstalled as she\u0027s not old enough yet. She did what I asked like she normally does and took it down. We didn\u0027t hear anything else of it until we heard about the poll. Kids don\u0027t know how to set their accounts to private so it\u0027s all public and someone got hold of her photo. I reported it to the police and they have been brilliant. They told Mia-Lili it\u0027s not her fault because she has been blaming herself, she thinks it\u0027s her fault for setting up an account. She has been the victim of severe bullying before. The kids used to rub her tummy and call her fat. We used to live in London and we moved to Norwich for a fresh start. We had finally got her confidence back up but now it is completely gone again.

Gemma Hughes, 25, spotted what she says is the face of her partner Dane Curran\u0027s late father Ian in the black and white scan of her son Vinnie. The boy was a rainbow baby after Gemma had suffered a devastating miscarriage in 2015, and Gemma believes Ian was watching over his grandson. She now credits him for being behind their intuition to take Vinnie to a hospital when he was seriously ill with bacterial meningococcal meningitis at just 10 weeks old.  It felt like the family couldn\u0027t escape the infection - as Dane had nearly died from it as a baby and it had also killed his brother at just four months old. Gemma now keeps a copy of the scan on her bedside table and claims a little bit of Ian remains with Vinnie each day, as the 22-month-old has his grandad\u0027s name as his middle name. The mum-of-two, from Sheffield, South Yorks, said: We were riding home in the car after having the scan and I opened up the picture to look at it, and I was admiring it, like you do, and noticed the face at the top.  I spotted it straight away as it is quite blatant. It\u0027s just bang, there looking down. It\u0027s as if it\u0027s in the clouds looking down, it\u0027s quite magical really. Straight away we knew who it was. We put Ian\u0027s photo against it and it\u0027s the same shaped face. The nose is identical and everything. We believe he was there for a reason, and that he came down to protect the baby for fear they could have meningitis. We believe that he is the baby\u0027s  angel and that\u0027s why he\u0027s showing up on this scan picture.  It is scary how many of our family have been affected by meningitis, especially considering it\u0027s not hereditary. It\u0027s nice to have that thought that we knew who it was. It brought lots of comfort to us. Ian Curran passed away suddenly aged just 45 around a decade ago from a heart attack. He had had to watch both Dane and his brother battle meningitis and sadly Dane\u0027s brother lost his battle aged just four months.  When Vinnie fell ill in November 2016, Gemma believes it was thanks to Ian watching over the family that they got the baby to hospital so quickly. Gemma, a stay-at-home mum while Dane works at a scrap merchant, said: Bacterial meningococcal meningitis is a very serious bug so it is a good job we got to hospital in time. He was very poorly though. He was normal and then one day out of the blue he went red hot and burnt up, his eyes were blinking and he was very ill. We had no idea what it was so rushed him to the children\u0027s hospital straight away. His heart rate fell though and they had to give him a lumbar puncture to find out what it was.  I was distraught, I felt sick. Dane was so scared when he heard it was meningitis because obviously his brother had died at four months old of it and he had had it as a baby. Dane\u0027s mum Zoe was there too and it was horrible for her having to go through it all over again. It was a very scary time but it was nice to have some peace of mind that we had someone watching over him through it all. We definitely were able to take some strength from what we had seen in the photo. She added: Zoe is quite spiritual too and she couldn\u0027t believe her eyes when she saw the photo as she recognised it as her husband.

Prince George, Princess Charlotte, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are among the royals that also feature in the set of pictures unveiled on Sunday night. The family appears in awe of the new prince, in particular little Charlotte who in one snap is turning away from the camera with her eyes fixed on her younger brother as she holds his hand. She sticks close to her mum Kate in the photos and appears to be a natural poser. Meanwhile George is sat next to or on his dad William\u0027s knee - perhaps to make him sit still as he appears to have trouble sitting still and looking straight at the camera. Louis\u0027s big day was the first time the Cambridges were seen together as a family of five. Little Louis, who is just 12 weeks old, was dressed in a cream, frilly lace royal christening gown - a replica of the intricate robe made for Queen Victoria’s eldest daughter in 1841. Four official images were taken by British photographer Matt Holyoak at Clarence House after Louis was baptised in The Chapel Royal at St James\u0027s Palace last Monday. Today Kensington Palace released a new picture of Prince Louis giggling.  The picture was taken by Matt Porteous, who also photographed Prince George on his birthday last year.  Kate, dressed in a cream outfit by Alexander McQueen, looks a picture of elegance as she cradles her third chilld. The Duchess, who opted for a white floral headpiece designed by Jane Taylor on the special day, appears smitten.  In one photo, Kate and William are joined by their children, along with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, and the Middleton family including Kate\u0027s sister Pippa Matthews and her husband James. Members of the royal family appear in another photo without the Middletons, a third photo features the Cambridge five and the fourth photo is an image of just Kate and Louis. The photographs were taken in the morning room and garden at Clarence House. Princess Charlotte appears to love posing in the pictures, with a big adorable smile. In the shot of the extended family, she is even holding her knee in a cute pose showing her confidence. She is wearing a blue and white dress with a bow headband to match, while George is smartly dressed in pair of shorts and white polo tshirt. George gives the photographer a cheeky smile in the photo where he is sat on his dad\u0027s knee, but in the others his expression appears more shy and reserved.  Mr Holyoak, who took the pictures, said: I was truly honoured at being asked to take the official photographs at the christening of Prince Louis, and to witness at first hand such a happy event. Everyone was so relaxed and in such good spirits, it was an absolute pleasure. I only hope I have captured some of that joy in my photographs. Louis was sound asleep as he was carried into the Chapel Royal by Kate for the christening ceremony which lasted 40 minutes. After the ceremony, the baby prince looked content and wiggled his fingers as Kate gazed down and beamed at him as she held him in her arms. His proud parents celebrated after the service by cutting a tier of their wedding cake.  The Archbishop of Canterbury presided over the christening supported by The Dean of The Chapel Royal, The Right Reverend and Right Honourable the Lord Chartres, and The Sub-Dean of The Chapel Royal, The Reverend Canon Paul Wright. The music and religious readings chosen by the royal couple included This Is The Day Which The Lord Hath made by John Rutter which was composed for their wedding in 2011. After much speculation over who William and Kate would give the honour to, they chose three godfathers and three godmothers, all of whom are friends or family. Louis’s godfathers are Nicholas van Cutsem, one of four brothers who have been close to William and Harry since they were very young William’s childhood friend Guy Pelly and Harry Aubrey-Fletcher, who was one of William’s close friends from both prep school and Eton College.

It\u0027s understood the 73-year-old has not spoken with the Duchess of Sussex since she married Prince Harry in a fairytale wedding at Windsor Castle almost two months ago. He\u0027s now said to want to fly the 5,550 miles from Mexico to London to try and see her - and \u0027doesn\u0027t care\u0027 if Meghan is p***ed off with him. “If I chose in a month, or couple of months, to go to En\u0026shyg\u0026shyland — I want to see my daughter.

He added that he was worried the former Suits actress was under too much pressure and that he was \u0027bemused\u0027 by the royal dress code. Thomas Sr, who turns 74 this week, also fears he may not have long to live due following his cardiac arrest and heart surgery. He suffered heart palpitations and had emergency surgery shortly after being exposed for faking paparazzi pictures for cash. Last week he begged Meghan and Harry to get in touch over fears \u0027he may die soon\u0027 and never see his daughter again.

A study of 2,000 motorists currently in the market for a new vehicle found 42 per cent are concerned that they may be taxed more in the near future if they decide to buy a vehicle which runs on diesel. As a result, more than half are considering switching to a car which runs on a more eco-friendly fuel in the near future. And 53 per cent think diesel vehicles will become less popular over the next two years. Despite concerns about rising diesel tax, three in five drivers have no idea what the changes to the Vehicle Excise Duty are and what they entail.  Of those who do understand what the VED is, 76 per cent believe the legislation – which will tax diesel vehicles more heavily from April 2019 – is punishing diesel drivers. A spokesperson for Vantage Leasing, which commissioned the study, said: “Whether drivers are making a concerted effort to be greener, or because they want to avoid the rising taxation on diesel vehicles, it looks like a shift to eco fuels is coming. “And while many drivers seem unaware of the changes coming to the Vehicle Excise Duty, it seems to be doing its job in dissuading the purchase of new diesel vehicles.” Of the drivers considering making the switch, 40 per cent are doing so because they want to drive a vehicle which is better for the environment. Four in five drivers surveyed consider themselves ‘eco-conscious’, and 83 per cent are concerned about the future of the planet. And 63 per cent currently worry about the effect their vehicle is having on the planet.  One in four drivers think a vehicle which runs on eco fuels is the more practical option as they believe they will be cheaper than diesel going forward. One in ten also think eco fuels are more futuristic and two thirds think leading a greener lifestyle has become ‘cool’ in recent years. Tesla is the car brand drivers most associate with environmentally-friendly driving, followed by Toyota and Nissan. But the study also found our eco-friendly tendencies take a backseat to costs, when running a greener vehicle becomes more expensive. For 27 per cent of buyers cost is more important than the environmental impact of the vehicle, with one in four opting to buy a cheaper, less environmentally-friendly car over a more expensive eco-friendly car. And 48 per cent think purchasing and running and eco-friendly vehicle is more expensive than a petrol or diesel alternative.

The country has enjoyed weeks of scorching weather, with the mercury rising to 33C in some parts. Hot and humid air from the Azores is expected to raise temperatures throughout this week, with plenty of sunshine in some parts across the weekend. But more unsettled weather will move in from the Atlantic with heavy, thundery showers forecast next week as low pressure begins to dominate. The remnants of former Hurricane Chris will merge with a large area of low pressure over Iceland and continue moving north-eastwards, picking up low pressure systems, as it tracks over the cold waters of the northern Atlantic. This will allow the changeable conditions to sweep in from the west bringing showers and longer spells of rain.  The jet stream will also move southwards increasing the chance of some heavy downpours with most widespread rain predicted for Northern Ireland and Scotland, while England and Wales will only be affected by scattered showers. Before then, sun lovers should make the most of the weekend warmth.   Forecaster Amy Hodgson, of The Weather Channel, said: “Increased cloud with outbreaks of light rain will affect Ireland and Scotland over the weekend, whilst England and Wales will be dry and mostly sunny. “It will be a hot and humid weekend in a south-westerly flow, with maximum temperatures in the mid to high 20s C across England and Wales, but cooler across Ireland and Scotland with highs in the high teens to low 20s C.” A Met Office forecaster said: Less hot, is the best way to describe next week, but it will still be warm.  There will be some sunny spells but there will be a few showers around that could be heavy and thundery. All parts of the UK will see some spells of sunshine, but there is likely to be relatively more in the way of rain or showers at times too, its website says. Some of the showers could be heavy or thundery at times. There may also be bands of more persistent rain on occasion which may bring some stronger winds too, especially to northern and western parts.

Elizabeth Lowe, 30, and husband James, 38, were married for five years before inviting Ashley Lowe and Audrie Lowe, both 22, into their marriage. The four of them - whose children are aged between one and eight - share a king-sized bed and have a rotation in bed so everyone gets a turn sleeping next to each other. Elizabeth said the relationship feels completely natural, but it has left her mum furious and led to them being shunned by their church.  But the mum, from Columbus, Ohio in the US, said she wouldn\u0027t change a thing about her love life, adding: My two wives, husband and I are happier than ever. We don\u0027t care what society thinks, because we love each other dearly. Elizabeth met James in a psychology class at Columbus State College in June 2008, and they quickly fell in love.  They married in June 2009 and, over the next five years, had six children together. But, despite their happy marriage, Elizabeth made a shocking confession to James in January 2014 telling him she wanted to bring a woman into their relationship. She said: James wasn\u0027t sure at first but, after two months, he grew to love the idea too.  In March 2014, Elizabeth met Audrie, from San Antonio, Texas, at her college cafeteria. Elizabeth, a bank worker, said: She was so lovely and pretty. I had an instant attraction to her. The next day, I introduced her to James at the cafeteria. The three of us started hanging out at the park with our kids.  Eventually I realised that I was in love with Audrie and, six months later, we confessed our feelings for each other. In August 2014, Audrie and I became intimate with each other. James was happy for us. Six months later, Audrie and James, who are both artists, fell in love while on a road trip alone in Texas. From that moment on, Ashley shared the couple\u0027s bed and the trio became polyamorous.  But they only lasted for a month as they met Ashley, also from San Antonio. Elizabeth said: Ashley and James became gym buddies. Within six months, James confessed he had feelings for Ashley. Both Audrie and I were on board, she was an amazing woman. It wasn\u0027t until we went on a family camping trip in February 2015 when Ashley told us she wanted to join our relationship.  We told her we loved her too. That day, we bought a king-sized bed so that we had plenty of space at night. We slept together for the first time. Being intimate with three other people felt completely natural. The quad soon labelled themselves as in a polyfidelity relationship where all members are considered equal partners and there\u0027s a mutual agreement to not allow any sexual activity with people outside of the group. Elizabeth said: Three months after we all got together, I called my mum and told her about Audrie and Ashley. She was furious.  She told me that the devil follows me wherever I go. It broke my heart. The four of us make love together, and we all love each other equally the same. We all have a rotation in bed which ensures everyone has a turn to sleep next to each other. Our sexual activity is relaxed in that we can be with anyone we choose at any time, within the quad.  The foursome enjoy date nights together at restaurants, but also split up depending on who feels like going out. Elizabeth said: We all hold hands and kiss when we go out. We do get funny looks sometimes, but we just laugh it off. A lot of people at our church have said that we are bad for the church and they don\u0027t agree with our lifestyle.

Luckily, a lifetime of having to make small talk with strangers and deal with a vast array of questions has its benefits when you\u0027re royal. Meaning Harry had the perfect response ready.

MirrorOnline reported yesterday how the business magnate called Vern Unsworth pedo guy after the diver, who lives in Chiang Rai in Thailand, criticised Mr Musk\u0027s offer to help in the rescue as a PR stunt.  Reports also claim Mr Unsworth is yet to see Mr Musk\u0027s tweets using the word \u0027pedo\u0027 - which is the American spelling abbreviation for \u0027paedophile\u0027.  But the Daily Mail reports that when asked if he will take legal action against Mr Musk he said: If it\u0027s what I think it is yes - before adding this ain\u0027t finished.

Elon Musk calls hero Brit diver \u0027PAEDO GUY\u0027 in bizarre Twitter outburst over Thailand cave rescue  Mr Musk, founder of Tesla and SpaceX, had claimed his prototype submarine could be used to rescue the 12 young Thai football players and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang caverns. But after the boys were rescued Mr Unsworth, 63, told CNN he can stick his submarine where it hurts - claiming it had absolutely no chance of working.  In a Twitter tirade yesterday, Mr Musk hit back, raging: “Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.”  The tweet now appears to have been deleted.   Thailand cave rescue: First schoolboys on their way out as heavy rain threatens dangerous mission  Mr Musk wrote: “Never saw this British expat guy who lives in Thailand (sus) at any point when we were in the caves. “Only people in sight were the Thai navy/army guys, who were great. Thai navy seals escorted us in — total opposite of wanting us to leave. “Water level was actually very low \u0026amp still (not flowing) — you could literally have swum to Cave 5 with no gear, which is obv how the kids got in. “If not true, then I challenge this dude to show final rescue video.

We will make one of the mini-sub/pod going all the way to Cave 5 no problemo. Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it. There is absolutely nothing to suggest Mr Unsworth, who played a vital role in the rescue and has been hailed as a hero, is a paedophile.  Criticising Mr Musk yesterday, he said: It just had absolutely no chance of working. They had no conception of what the cave passage was like. The submarine, I believe was about 5ft 6 long, rigid, so it wouldn\u0027t have gone round corners or any obstacles. It wouldn\u0027t have made the first 50 metres into the cave from the dive start point. Just a PR stunt.

great-grandfather started his working life in Dundee’s jute mills before becoming a roofer.He even helped to build his future workplace at Asda Kirkton more than 40 years ago.Jim and his wife Patricia, of Whitfield, have four daughters and two sons.Their family also now includes 15 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.One of Jim’s daughters, Debbie, even followed in his footsteps when she also became an Asda Ace and went on to work on the checkouts.Jim spent 15 years as an Asda Ace and for the last few years has been responsible for keeping the bakery and deli in tip-top condition.Samantha Will, community champion at Asda Kirkton, organised a special retirement lunch for the much-loved colleague.Jim was given a new set of wheels – in the shape of an inflatable walking frame.Debbie said: “My dad doesn’t actually want to give up work but it is time for him to go.“He was surprised by the retirement lunch – he didn’t think they were going to do anything for him.“My dad has never been unemployed. Both him and my mum have always worked so I don’t know what he is going to do with himself now.”Samantha said: “Jim is a familiar face in Asda Kirkton and always has a smile for everyone.“He is loved by all of the staff here and we will miss him tremendously.”Jim loves taking bus tours, and with plenty of spare time now on his hands, he is heading to the Highlands with Patricia for a short holiday.After all his hard work at Asda, he certainly deserves it.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3c945d428df-e1530717812765.jpg ","title":"dundee people asda staff do summit special for charity","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe fantastic staff at Asda Kirkton have once again done their bit for local charities.A group of 11 employees of the store climbed to the summit of Ben Nevis – a feat they achieved with the help of various local organisations.Samantha Will, community champion at the supermarket, said: “Some of us were given waterproofs by Ancrum Outdoor Centre and Dundee Sea Cadets drove us there and back in their minibus.“The sea cadets also provided a volunteer driver, Rachel, who was our angel for the day.“She picked us up at 6am on Sunday morning and we got back at 1am on Monday.“It was a long day but she didn’t complain once.“We are so very grateful for their help and we would all like to thank them for their generosity.”The walkers raised more than £2,000 through their endeavours.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3c9461ea0ea-e1530717008602.jpg ","title":"dundee people craigs wedding proposal to aimee was an italian job","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCraig Mitchell was certainly a lucky man when his stunning bride Aimee O’Connor walked down the aisle.Craig, 31, and 27-year-old Aimee were married at Craigsanquhar House Hotel on May 12 after six years together.The pair became a couple early in 2012 after years of friendship.All it took was a chat in the Aboukir Pub in Carnoustie for team manager Craig to realise that Aimee was more than the party girl he had assumed she was.Following event sales manager Aimee’s 21st birthday celebrations at the end of January that year, Craig picked her up from the students’ union in Dundee and took her to his parents’ house in Monikie.Rather than one night together, Aimee stayed for the next three days.Craig’s parents were on holiday and with snow covering the streets, the newly-formed pair spent the following few days cosied up watching films and going for walks round the park – with Aimee borrowing now mother-in-law Tina’s hiking boots.Two weeks later came the couple’s first official date on Valentine’s Day and it was that night after a trip to the cinema they became boyfriend and girlfriend.Three years later, Craig plucked up the courage to ask permission from Aimee’s parents to pop the question.On the final day of a four-day trip to Italy, Craig attempted to find the perfect spot to get down on one knee.He thought he had found it while walking in the town of Sirmione taking in views of Lake Garda. However, it wasn’t to be as while he rummaged in his bag to find the ring, he was interrupted by a group of German tourists.With the mood killed, they went to the beach, but after sunbathing for just 10 minutes, Craig said they should go back to the hotel because he was too hot.He chose the balcony of their room which overlooked the lake to ask Aimee to become his wife.Aimee couldn’t even answer and instead simply burst into tears of happiness.After careful planning by the couple, the morning of the wedding arrived and the sun was shining.Aimee said: “When I woke up and saw the sun I was so happy that I was getting my outdoor wedding.“It made the photos taken by Burfly Photography from the day look really green and beautiful.“We had a flower wall created by Celebre which was stunning and it would have been a beautiful backdrop for the ceremony too.”The bride was accompanied down the aisle by stepdad Graham and the ceremony conducted by humanist Neil Anderson was the highlight of the day.“We made sure that the ceremony wasn’t boring and it was very personal,” said Aimee.“Neil was absolutely incredible and delivered our story in a fun way.“The night-time reception was brilliant but the day-time was our highlight.”The pair took to the floor to have their first dance as a married couple to The Verve’s hit song Lucky Man, which was performed by band Paper Tiger.Craig and Aimee would like to thank their wedding planners Katy and Fiona, videographers I Do, bridal shop Annarose and all their family and friends.Aimee added: “I wouldn’t change a thing about my wedding.

An employment tribunal awarded him more than £10,000.But now Mr Brown, who runs events and production company The Longest Forty, is taking the club and American director Mr Nelms to a tribunal again – this time citing post-employment victimisation and harassment.The action stems from a dispute over a Legends of the Ball – Champions 2013/2014 event which was due to take place at the Doubletree by Hilton on the outskirts of the city in February.It is understood that Mr Brown alleges that Dens Park chief Mr Nelms contacted Hilton boss Richard Ellison and forced him to cancel the event – leading to a breach of contract – and said he was unhappy someone who was successful in a claim against the club was working alongside the hotel.He also alleges Mr Nelms prevented current Dundee players Craig Wighton and Cammy Kerr from attending the event, despite them having already agreed to do so and having been advertised as appearing.The event was cancelled and Mr Brown alleges this was due to his previous case against Dundee.He now wants damages and alleges that Mr Nelms’ actions were maliciously motivated.It is understood both the club amd Mr Nelms dispute Mr Brown’s claims and insist he did not intervene and that official permission was never sought for players to attend the event.Dundee FC and representatives for Mr Nelms declined to comment.Solicitor Ryan Russell, of Muir Myles and Laverty, confirmed he had been instructed to pursue a claim on Mr Brown’s behalf.He said: “Due to the ongoing legal proceedings, it would inappropriate to comment at this stage on the specifics or merits of the claim.

He has also raised concerns at Westminster about such firms on several occasions.He said: \"People should not be charged inflated fees when they have paid for parking in good faith.\"The British Parking Association confirmed to me in person it is their view that people should not be charged if they have made an error inputting their registration.\"This guidance must be heeded by parking operators and, where it is not, there needs to be greater enforcement.\"He added: \"It is high time that operators like Smart Parking were removed from our city centres once and for all.\"The MP was responding to the case of Roger High, from Nottinghamshire, who failed to persuade Smart Parking to overturn a charge issued to him and will now have to cough up \u0026pound100.He said: \"In my appeal I explained that I had transposed two of the letters [in my registration number] and the fact that the registration number was so similar to my postcode that it was easy to make such a small slip.\"I was appalled and livid to receive an email rejecting my appeal, even though they acknowledged that I had purchased a car parking ticket, on the grounds that I had not purchased it for the correct registration number.\"Visiting the area frequently to see family, Mr High insisted Smart Parking\u0027s actions \"would not change\" his love of this part of the world.However, he revealed the experience had left him \"miserable and depressed as well as outraged\".Highland Council trading standards officer William Paul, who has been involved in long-running discussions with Smart Parking, said he was surprised to hear about Mr High\u0027s problems, believing there had been positive changes at the site.It is understood ticket machine key pads have been made bigger to reduce the chance of errors and new software aims to eliminate charges being issued when easily detectable genuine mistakes are made.\"We are encouraged by recent improvements in the operating procedures of the car park and to be fair to the company, these improvements do seem to be making a difference,\" he said.\"We are assured that these improvements are based on a firm commitment to resolve the previous reported issues, including incorrect vehicle registration mark (VRM) entries.\"He encouraged any drivers affected by charge notices to follow Smart Parking\u0027s appeals system and, if necessary, report the matter via the Citizens Advice Consumer Service on 03454 040506 or at www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scotland/consumerA spokesman for Smart Parking said: \"It is a contractual requirement for motorists to input their correct registration mark when parking at Strothers Lane Car park and failure to do so is a breach of the terms and conditions of parking there which can result in a Parking Charge Notice being issued.\"However Smart Parking acknowledges that motorists can make minor mistakes when entering their registration and as such working closely with Highland Trading Standards, has put in place measures to try to identify genuine mistakes against actual registration marks using the car park. Where the mistake is minor and the actual registration mark can be cross referenced Smart parking will endeavour to identify this and not issue the Parking Charge notice.\"Motorists are encouraged to double check their registration number before entering it and if those using the car park have entered a registration mark and subsequently received a Parking Charge Notice they are encouraged to engage with Smart Parking through our British Parking Association accredited appeals process.\"Monday 16 Jul 2018 4:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116630.jpg","title":"Schoolgirls inspiring bid to wipe out racism","story":"\u0026nbspA DETERMINED eight-year-old has been praised after taking an inspirational stand against racism in her community by personally removing a vile message she found defacing a local mural.Breagha Gowans spotted the anti-Muslim slur scribbled on the wall of an underpass near Culloden Wood while out for a walk with her mother Michelle.After the pair had a chat about what exactly the message \u0026ndash which the Courier will not print \u0026ndash meant, the youngster decided to step up and take it upon herself to erase it, gathering a bag full of cleaning equipment for the job.\"I wanted to clean up the graffiti because I have a friend at school who is Muslim and I didn\u0026rsquot want her to be upset,\" she said.\"I wanted to be kind towards others.\"The underpass where Breagha spotted the graffiti passes below Barn Church Road and is covered in a colourful mural in a deliberate bid to dissuade would-be vandals from defacing the walls.After scrubbing the wall clean again, she appealed to everyone to show more respect towards those around them.\"Please don\u0026rsquot do it because it is hateful and no-one likes bullies,\" she said.\"It isn\u0026rsquot good to hurt people\u0027 feelings and I didn\u0026rsquot like to see something that would make someone feel bad.\"Breagha\u0027 father is Inverness South councillor Ken Gowans who said he was proud of the way she had decided to tackle the problem head-on.\"I told her it was fantastic \u0026ndash though like a typical eight-year-old she was off doing something else,\" he said.\"Breagha and her class have been learning about different religions at Inshes Primary School and she has a very strong sense of justice and fairness.\"It is a testament to what they are teaching in school.

A friendly at Inverness Caley Thistle on Wednesday had to be called off due to injury problems.Summer signing Stephen Gleeson (knee), Niall McGinn (thigh), Mikey Devlin (groin) and Frank Ross (groin) are injured.The Reds are still awaiting the full results of a scan which will reveal the extent of Gleeson’s injury.He will miss tomorrow’s friendly with Cove Rangers, but the Dons are still hopeful he could feature against Burnley in the Europa League second qualifying round, the first leg of which is on July 26.Another summer signing, Chris Forrester (groin), and Sam Cosgrove (calf) were also injured but are expected to be fit to face Cove tomorrow.So far this summer the Dons have only signed three players with £200,000 outlaid for the capture of Forrester from Peterborough United.Republic of Ireland international Gleeson was secured on a free. An SPFL tribunal will decide the training compensation due for teenager Lewis Ferguson who signed from Hamilton.Polish defender Krystian Nowak is currently training with the Dons and is set to feature as a trialist in tomorrow’s friendly.The 24-year-old is a free agent having had his contract with Greek side Panionios terminated earlier this summer.Aberdeen also had a bid for Doncaster striker John Marquis, understood to be for £250,000, rejected.Boss Derek McInnes confirmed that bid was the highest the Reds could go to and they will now look at other potential targets for centre-forward.Celtic and Rangers have both invested heavily in their squads this season.But Considine insists the heavy spending of the Old Firm will only inspire Aberdeen.He said: “Celtic always generate so much money through their transfers and whatever.“You expect it from them.“Due to the situation with Rangers they haven’t been able to do that, but this year they have. It is great to see and is healthy for Scottish football.“A strong Rangers is good for the league.“It also brings us on.“In the past few years or so we have still remained second so regardless of what they are going to spend we are still going to challenge this season again.”Aberdeen’s preparations for the Euro tie with Burnley conclude with a friendly against West Brom at Pittodrie on Friday.The Baggies were relegated to the Championship at the end of last season.Considine said: ”When we play West Brom here that will be a good indication of what is coming.“Although they were obviously relegated, in my eyes they are still a Premier League team.“That will be a good test for us and will show where we are at and what is coming opposition wise.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"win tickets to see the lady boys of bangkok in aberdeen","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAfter the incredible response to our first Lady Boys of Bangkok giveaway we\u0026#8217ve managed to secure another pair of tickets!So prepare for a night you’ll talk about for years as they flirt, tease and tempt!No one will leave the show without a smile on their face and a song in their heart.To be in with a chance of winning the tickets for the 7pm showing on July 26, simply fill in our form below.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen museum to open doors to kids with additional needs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen museum is to host its first relaxed opening for children with additional support needs.The Gordon Highlanders Museum will open its doors to visitors with extra needs, their families and carers on Monday July 23.The event is part of a summer partnership with the charity Me Too.Gordon Highlanders Museum curator Ruth Duncan said: “As a lively museum with lots going on, we know that sometimes this can be challenging for visitors with additional support needs.“We are committed to removing barriers to accessing the museum and hope we can encourage more visitors who perhaps wouldn’t normally consider coming to the museum to pop in.”Learning officer at the museum Lewis Gibbon said: “We are thrilled to be working in partnership with Me Too on our first relaxed day.“I hope this is a stepping stone for more collaborations with this fantastic charity.”Visitors will be able to explore the display areas in a calm, relaxed atmosphere, take part in some additional craft activities and check out some of the museum’s handling collection.Me Too chief executive Phionna McInnes said she was happy the museum would be more accessible.She said: “I am delighted to be working in partnership with Gordon Highlanders Museum and their commitment to make their facilities accessible to people with additional support needs who may struggle to access the facilities due to sensory considerations or understanding from others.“This not only gives an opportunity to local participants but also gives a clear message to tourists that the museum is making an effort to be accessible to a wider community.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/5b48aaf9adf64-442x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet could you give a forever home to any of these animals","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAre you looking to get a new pet?

You see how tired we were on Saturday – we’ll be a lot more tired tomorrow.“We went there last year and lost 5-1, but we actually played quite well.“Hopefully the score’s not as bad this time. We will try to win.”Spectators will be looking for a bit more excitement tomorrow than was on offer at Glebe Park.However, McInally, who only had four substitutes because of injuries, thought his players – some only playing their second 90 minutes of the summer – looked the part against a team from the league above them. He said: “It was a poor game.“I don’t know if it was the heat – the pitch is really lush. The ball was slow and I wouldn’t like to have paid to watch that.“It was nice to get the bonus point and not concede a goal.“I thought our two young centre-backs (Brown and new boy Cameron Eadie) did really well again. They’ve done well in pre-season.“They’ll get a testing again tomorrow night. We can play miles better than that, but it’s early in the season.”In the opening period at Brechin, Blue Toon skipper Rory McAllister was denied twice when through on goal – first by a brilliant Jordan Tapping tackle and then seeing a left-footed volley deflected just past the post.Up the other end, the busy Callum Tapping dragged a glorious opportunity past the far right post.City should have been in front by the break, with Callum Tapping spurning more chances as Dene Shields also saw a back-post header saved and Sean Burns’ free-kick hit the bar.There were less in the way of chances after half-time, but again it was Brechin who should have taken the lead, with Greg Fleming tipping the game’s best chance, a Shields header from point-blank range, over the bar.In the shoot-out, Peterhead were first to blink, with full-back for the day Willie Gibson hitting the right post with his side’s third. However, Brechin defender Paul McLean then rolled his past the left post.In sudden death, Giuliano Moreno’s blast was tipped on to the bar and out by the diving Fleming, which left Brown to smash into the top-left corner for the extra point.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"exciting shinty at the macaulay sixes","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 22/06/18, 8:15 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowNo fewer than 29 youth shinty teams travelled to Oban\u0026#8217s Mossfield Park for the annual Macaulay six-a-side competition.The winners of the main competition for P7 and under were Inverlochy, who defeated Taynuilt 1-0 in the final with Taynuilt taking the Oban Celtic Shield.The Alastair Campbell Shield for P5 and under was won by Braxi Boys from Inverlochy who defeated Bute in a very exciting final after extra time by one penalty to nil.The Macaulay Development trophy was won by Rockfield Rapids.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

The biggest cheer of the day was reserved for this year’s Queen Chloe Macdonald, who together with her Princesses Caitlyn Prentice and Cara Mackie were introduced to the crowd by Rev Robert Macleod and Councillor Anne Horn.Tarbert’s new Royal Family then led the famous festival parade where locals and visitors alike dressed up and joined in with this year’s Heroes and Villains theme.  Pirates and superheroes watched on as Cruella De Vil and her dogcatcher tried to capture more Dalmatian puppies. And the Batmobile was hot on the trail of the Joker who was seen heading through the village with Poison Ivy.One of the festival’s most eagerly anticipated events is the cookery demonstrations, once again led by Mike Leslie of Kilsyth’s Coachman Hotel. The market area was packed as cooks got some professional tips on how to prepare and cook seafood.While the adults tucked into some of Tarbert’s finest fish and shellfish, younger festival-goers were being wowed by the gravity defying Clan Stunt Bike Team, before learning new skills in the circus workshop.Highland dancing displays plus performances by festival regulars Mid Argyll Pipe Band ensured there was something for everyone, before Sunday’s Beer on the Pier, where party people of all ages packed Tarbert’s quay, ready to be entertained.Girl band Feeva promised and delivered ‘cheesy tunes’ and were closely followed by Scotland’s number one Take That cover band, Could It Be Take That, to keep the party atmosphere going. Local band The Democrats brought the curtain down on this year’s festival in style.With just three people in the festival committee it fell to organiser Margaret MacNeill to comment on this year’s event saying: \u0026#8216Thank you to everyone who came and joined in with this year\u0026#8217s Seafood Festival.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12468674.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_240218grant_07JPG.jpg","title":"maybole super school one step","story":"NewsMaybole super-school is one step closer to being builtCouncillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson15:27, 10 JUL 2018NewsNew Carrick Academy artist impression (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA \u0026pound42million super-school has taken a step closer to being built in Maybole. Councillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy. Plans will see Cairn and Gardenrose Primaries merge to become a new school located at the purpose-built campus. Nurseries for both schools would also merge to be ready for August 2021. St Cuthbert’s Primary – where parents responding to the consultation issued a rejection of the move – would also relocate but operate as a stand-alone school. A bid for funding will now be made to the Scottish Government. A total of 87 written responses were received during the council’s consultation that officials noted was “low considering the size of Maybole with a population of 4,700 people”.

Bids of \u0026pound1.5million are being sought for Enterkine House, perched above Annbank. The luxury four-star retreat, which boasts 74 acres of land, employs around 50 staff. Kirk House and Steading, a six-bedroom farmhouse currently used as overspill accommodation for the hotel, is also included. Agents Christie \u0026amp Co and Galbraith said the plot offered “potential for development under a new owner”. It follows a long-running noise battle at the hotel which saw bosses spend \u0026pound80,000 soundproofing their wedding marquee. Council chiefs were told that slapping an 11pm curfew on party bands could put the hotel out of business.  But they finally got the all-clear earlier this year and revealed plans to build a permanent structure. However, the hotel is now being offered to the market. Bob Cherry, a partner with Galbraith, said: “The purchaser of Enterkine would find it relatively straightforward to continue the current business, which is well-established, and there are further opportunities for diversification or expansion of the tourism and events facilities on the estate, subject to the necessary consents. “This is a beautiful estate with a thriving hotel business and potential for further development.” Brian Sheldon, of Christie \u0026amp Co, added: “The market for country house hotels such as Enterkine House has vastly improved in recent years. “Its location in South Ayrshire and within such an enviable estate and countryside will attract local, regional and potentially international operators. “Whilst the business is trading well, there is certainly scope for further growth.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"royal troon golf club make","story":"NewsRoyal Troon golf club make generous donation to hospital unitIt follows a charity 18-hole golf event with Troon Portland and Troon Ladies, writes Charlene Bennie.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post15:39, 10 JUL 2018News\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoyal Troon Golf Club has made the generous donation of \u0026pound1k to Crosshouse Hospital’s Acute Stroke Unit. It follows a charity 18-hole golf event with Troon Portland and Troon Ladies. The game was then followed by a raffle. The three clubs had to choose a charity to donate funds to, with Royal Troon deciding to donate to Ward 3E. Andrew Power, club captain of Royal Troon, said: “We chose to donate to the Acute Stroke Unit as three of our members were in this unit over the last year and are all now recovering well. The word from them is that they got the best of care and were delighted we chose to donate to the unit” During the event, Stroke and TIA (Transient Ischaemic Attack) information packs were handed out, making it a great opportunity to spread awareness of how to act when someone is suffering from a stroke.  Andrew added: “We had a great day, great weather and we were glad we made a good amount for a good cause. We’d like to say from all at Royal Troon that you (staff at Ward 3E) do a great job and hope this cheque can help out in any way it can”. Senior charge nurse, Christine Sommerville, said: “Patients are admitted from all over Ayrshire to the ASU. Stroke happens with no warning, but with specialised care and input, outcomes are improved. “We are delighted to hear the members are recovering well and that they had a positive experience in the ASU. “On behalf of the ASU team, a big thank you.

Steve the Seagull sneakily snatches a bag of crisps from bakery giant Greggs in Ayr. The sly bird checks to see if the coast is clear and grabs a packet of Walkers if staff are busy – and he’s tried every flavour. Greggs team member Charley Cooper said: “He could be in three times a day. He always goes for the crisps on the bottom shelf. He also took a pack of yum-yums recently. “He is like a thief in the night. He stalks this place. I shout ‘Steve’ and he flys off.” Hilariously the staff have dubbed the winged bandit ‘Steve Segal’ after the action movie actor.  Charley said the popular pest has been causing a flap for about two years. Air traffic controller Steve McNamara made a video of the bird in action last Tuesday. The dad-of-three said: “It was so funny. It landed outside Greggs, walked straight to the crisps stand inside, got a pack of ready salted and headed back out to the pavement. “ It then whacked the packet with its beak and devoured them. It only stopped to let out a cry of joy in the middle of its feast. “A few other people saw it and were incredulous. I had a feeling the bird wasn’t a first offender and it looked like it knew exactly what it was doing. It was a snatch theft.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article3294074.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/JS33570090.jpg","title":"up your game face boot","story":"NewsUp your game or face the boot - shock SNP ultimatum to South Ayrshire Council leaderIt comes as rival camps “fight like rats” to wrestle the council’s power base back on track.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson15:21, 10 JUL 2018NewsCouncil leader Douglas Campbell (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailUp your game or face the boot. That’s the shock ultimatum delivered by warring SNP councillors to their embattled leader. Douglas Campbell has been ordered to regain control of his split ranks during the council’s summer break. It comes as rival camps “fight like rats” to wrestle the council’s power base back on track. A racism storm and failed coup on Councillor Campbell has plunged the SNP into crisis. And the Post understands another plot to oust the leader is now brewing. It follows all SNP group members signing a declaration of support for their under-fire boss just two weeks ago. But a party insider has revealed growing disquiet is threatening to tear the group apart.  Within hours of the public show of support, Cllr Campbell was being placed under increasing pressure to step down of his own accord, rather than face another bruising challenge from within, the Post has learned. A senior source said: “People agreed to fall in line and sign the declaration for the sake of the bigger picture. “But it’s widely accepted that a change is required and this can’t go on. “The group is in a position where people will fight like rats to get what they want. “However, the even bigger concern is trying to keep the administration intact.” Worries over a potential walkout from Labour colleagues has, until now, ensured enough SNP support behind Cllr Campbell. A potential change in the their leadership is thought that have strained relations with administration partners, who have indicated they are happier working with Cllr Campbell.  But the Post understands that Cllr Campbell’s Labour past is forming a big part of the problem for the SNP leader as he battles factions within his new party. And a new warning – issued as councillors left for their summer break – stressed that he must crack the whip among his troubled ranks. The source added: “It was made very clear that if he doesn’t, the matter will be taken out of his hands. “The party is being crucified every week and it cannot be allowed to continue. “Some see Douglas as being far too close to Labour and that is undoubtedly a big issue for him. “Either way, he’s been given the message in clear terms that he needs to get everyone behind him and on the same page.” When asked about the warning, the group’s depute leader, William Grant, insisted: “This is news to me.” Cllr Campbell added: “Cllr Grant responded to your enquiry that ‘This is news to me’ and I have nothing to add.” "},{"url":null,"title":"rogue-roofers-con-borders-pensioner-out-of-four-figure-sum","story":"ROGUE roofers have conned a Borders pensioner out of a four-figure sum of money.\nAn incident took place in Kelso on Thursday, July 5 when two men attended the property, offering to carry out temporary roof repairs.\nThe resident, a man in his eighties, was convinced to pay the sum in cash for some very minor work.\nOne man is described as white, aged between 40 to 45, tall, medium build, black hair past his ears, with an English accent, wearing a black leather jacket, white t-shirt and black shorts.\nThe other man is described as white, also aged between 40 to 45, brown neck length hair, tall, broader build, with a Scottish accent, wearing a white t-shirt and brown shorts.\nThe men are believed to have been travelling in a plain white van.\nPolice Scotland have launched an investigation into the incident.\nA spokesperson said: \"We often see an increase in bogus caller incidents at this time of year, with bogus callers offering to carry out property repairs or garden maintenance.

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

wisely","story":"Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current period of hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer usage has increased significantly.With the current weather conditions forecast to continue people should take simple but important steps to conserve public water supplies.In some areas there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water during the summer and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely and  to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Some water treatment works and distribution networks are working at near capacity to meet demand.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of usage and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce usage wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their usage and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible, use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.Scotland’s public water supply is the lifeblood of the country, for household and business customers and more than 1.3 billion litres is used per day.There is a strong and resilient water distribution network but everyone will need to play their part as Scotland enjoys its hottest and driest summer in many years.To help customers use water wisely, advice is at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or by calling 0800 0778778.Peter

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.

Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.

The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.

The volunteers arrived on the scene shortly after 5.35pm to find the man with \u0026ldquosevere blisters on his feet and in considerable pain.  A spokesman for the Dunbar RNLI said: \u0026ldquoHe and his partner had been enjoying a barbecue on the beach.  \u0026ldquoWhen the barbecue cooled they moved it elsewhere but the man stood on sand where the disposable tray had been sitting.  \u0026ldquoThe heat of the sand was such his feet blistered.  \u0026ldquoCrew members used burn bags to protect the man\u0026rsquos feet as they, with help from two surfers, transferred him to the lifeboat.  \u0026ldquoThey then headed to the nearby chalets at Shore Road, where an ambulance crew was waiting to treat the man for his injuries.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.  Paul is hoping to get a job based in computer security once he finishes his studies."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8024055.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"couple-get-permission-to-turn-old-bar-back-into-pub","story":"  Michael and Wendy Peters took over the Gardeners Arms in Haddington in 2011 when its licence had come under review because of problems experienced by previous management.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

In April, Police Scotland asked East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board to review the pub\u0026rsquos licence and that of its manager Christopher Darling.  However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.

The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.

They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier. He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.  The artists were commissioned to undertake the work, which is being funded by Tesco with \u0026pound38,000 for each of the two sculptures, as part of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art Policy."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8046040.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"queen-named-ahead-of-dunbar-rnli-lifeboat-day","story":"  This year\u0026rsquos Lifeboat Queen is 14-year-old Beth Mackay, with attendants Mia Thomson, 11, and 12-year-old Anushka Demer.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park. That would require special funding applications.  Stuart Gibb, area manager of Dunbar and East Linton Area Partnership (DELAP), said that consultation had already taken place with groups such as DELAP and the town\u0026rsquos community council, as well as various departments of East Lothian Council.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe area partnership is supporting the acknowledgement that the town is getting bigger.  \u0026ldquoFacilities and amenities need to be on the ball in terms of that growth to ensure that we have suitable and sustainable facilities moving forward."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8055467.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scottish-open-the-renaissance-club-to-stage-2019-tournament","story":"  This year\u0027s tournament is due to get under way tomorrow (Thursday) at Gullane Golf Club and, in 12 months\u0027 time,\u0026nbspwill move just three miles along the coast as it is played at the Renaissance Club, at Archerfield.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done. They will be supported in this by a multi-disciplinary team from the partnership."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8061096.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"bus-mounts-pavement-in-tranent","story":"  The 62-year-old, who was driving an empty Prentice coach at the time of the incident, is understood to have taken ill at the wheel as it pulled out from a bus stop.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.

Now the 29-year-old from Macmerry works with the likes of Hearts defender John Souttar, Motherwell star Chris Cadden and Rangers midfielder Greg Docherty on the mental side of their games.  He told the Courier how the drastic change in career came about: \u0026ldquoWhen I was a PT people used to come to me and ask for a diet plan or a training plan.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquod say \u0026lsquohave you had one of these before?\u0026rsquo and they\u0026rsquod tell me they\u0026rsquod had seven or eight.

I then went to Thailand on a course and it\u0026rsquos all gone from there.  John, a former Ross High School pupil, initially worked with youth football clubs across the county while trying to make a breakthrough to top-level players. He said: \u0026ldquoI sent messages, filled out contact forms and heard nothing until this time last year, when John [Souttar] got in touch.  \u0026ldquoI think there is a bit of a stigma because it\u0026rsquos psychology and people think you\u0026rsquove got to have a \u0026lsquoproblem\u0026rsquo but it\u0026rsquos not about that.  \u0026ldquoI focus on three things: mindset, the player as a person and their performance. I believe that a better person is a better player so what they do off the pitch is massively important.  And he explained how he worked with players on an individual basis, saying: \u0026ldquoI get to know the players.  \u0026ldquoSomeone could be struggling with self-confidence, or we all know what social media is like \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos where I come in to help them.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

Mrs Reid, known as Kit, told how she exchanged early memories of her nursing career and the transition into the NHS with the royal guest.  She said: \u0026ldquoMy first pay was two pound notes and a 10 shilling note. The week before national health it was seven (shillings) and six (pence).  Mrs Reid, of Haddington worked as a nurse from 1946 until 1952 and spent some of her career at Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The grandmother of five, with triplets in Seattle and a grandson in Saskatchewan, Canada, and a further grandson at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u0026ldquoThe Duke was absolutely normal.  \u0026ldquoHe spoke to me and asked various things about the work I had done.  \u0026ldquoObviously he had been briefed because he asked me about the pay and for what felt like a long time he spoke to me.  \u0026ldquoHe was just so charming \u0026ndash it was the thrill of a lifetime, the whole thing.  \u0026ldquoI met so many wonderfully interesting people \u0026ndash people from Orkney and Shetland, from all over Scotland, with their own stories to tell.  \u0026ldquoIt was just absolutely wonderful \u0026ndash I even got to walk on a red carpet.  Mrs Reid said that the NHS had made a massive difference to the way of life across Scotland and said she was \u0026ldquoall for the NHS.  The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.  The evening reception, attended by 700 people, was one of a series of events taking place around the UK to mark 70 years since the health service was founded.  During the engagement, Prince William watched a short film about the history of the NHS and listened to singing by the NHS Forth Valley Nurses Choir."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064994.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"rugby-stars-take-on-golfers-at-gullane-ahead-of-scottish-open","story":"  Scotland caps Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings faced off against South African Dean Burmester and New Zealander Ryan Fox in a \u0027rugby vs golf\u0027 challenge.\u0026nbsp  Kinghorn and Hastings kicked rugby balls around the championship course, while Fox and Burmester got some practice in earlier this week, with the rugby stars coming out on top 2-1.\u0026nbsp  Below is a video of the challenge. . .\u0026nbsp      Rugby \u0026#127386 Golf    With @LeuchieHouse and @MNDoddie5 as the official charities this week, we decided to have fun with a little #RugbyGolf challenge \u0026#127945\u0026#9971 pic.twitter/eCH0KBEjin  The Scottish Open\u0027s two charity partners this year are the My Name\u00275 Doddie Foundation, set-up by former Scotland rugby star Doddie Weir following his diagnosis with Motor Neurone Disease and Leuchie House, the North Berwick-based national respite charity of which Adam\u0027s dad Gavin Hastings is patron."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8070351.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"all-the-latest-from-day-three-of-the-scottish-open-at-gullane","story":"  He carded a two-under-par 68 in his third round today (Saturday) to lead the tournament at Gullane Golf Club.\u0026nbsp  He\u0026rsquos a shot clear of a six-strong group that includes American Rickie Fowler, the 2015 Scottish Open\u0026nbspchampion at Gullane.

Labour MP Mary Creagh, who has consistently pressed on the issue, called on ministers to \u0026ldquoget a grip and end the \u0026ldquounlawful practice.  Ms Creagh, speaking in the Commons, raised the case of an Indian national who received \u0026pound50,000 in damages from the Government after being placed in an immigration detention centre and unlawfully separated from his three-year-old daughter.  The man was detained under immigration powers in June 2017 after serving a 20-month prison sentence for unlawful wounding.  The child, an EU national, was placed in care during his jail term, but had been in regular contact with her father.  Ms Creagh said: \u0026ldquoDespite compelling evidence of the harm caused to children by the indefinite detention of their parents the Home Office continues to separate them in an arbitrary and cruel manner.  \u0026ldquoWhat is she doing to get a grip on the situation, stop this unlawful practice, tell us how many children are affected and reunite them with their families?  Ms Nokes told MPs that the \u0026ldquowelfare and safeguarding of children is at the heart of the family returns process, adding: \u0026ldquoOther than in exceptional circumstances a child will not be separated from both parents for immigration purposes, detention is used sparingly for the purposes of public protection and removal.  Addressing the case of the Indian national Ms Nokes added: \u0026ldquoThe Home Office acknowledged its mistakes and indeed paid compensation, it is worth remembering of course that in 2009 more than 1,000 children went into detention, whereas the last year for which there are figures available it was only 44.

At Islay Ales they produce a range of both cask and bottles conditioned beers. The bottled beers are real ale in a bottle. The beer is neither filtered nor pasteurised prior to being bottled and therefore continues to ferment and mature in the bottle. This process produces sediment in the bottom of the bottle.    They have recently started to make use of the fact that many individuals have bottled their own whisky on Islay and are looking for something special to do with the empty cask. They fill these casks with part of a brew and then allow the influences of the whisky and the wood to act on the beer by maturing it for at least six weeks up to almost three months, depending on the requirements of the customer.  This year Islay Ales were delighted to have been asked by WW100 Islay to produce an ale to commemorate the ending of the First World War and to remember those lives lost in the tragic sinking of two troops ships off Islay  Visitors are more than welcome to visit the Brewery, they are happy to show how the beers are brewed in the 4-barrel plant, which produces 1150 pints (640 litres) at a time. Depending on what day you come to the brewery you could see the brewing in action or it might be the casking, bottling or labelling, all of which takes place on site.  Before or after a tour of the brewery you can sample some of the available ales, sometimes Islay Ales might even have some on draught for you to try. You can also purchase bottles of the beers as well as Thistly Cross Cider. If you are looking for presents or something to remember them by, the Brewery shop has a range of clothing, glasses and other items.    The Brewery and shop is open from 10.30 to 5.00 Monday to Saturday during the summer but only to 4.00 in the winter. They generally do not open on Sundays unless a special request has been made.  A large number of establishments on Islay take the ales, either in bottle form or on draught so when you come to visit the island you are sure to be able to find Islay Ales near to where you are staying.  www.islayales  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Brander Lodge  Nestled within a scenic and tranquil location, The Brander Lodge offers comfortable and stylish facilities for those looking to relax and explore.

Tom Inns, director of the Glasgow School of Art, last week moved to end speculation about the future of the gutted building, saying it would be rebuilt, in a painstaking process involving the dismantling of sections by hand, with the bricks logged and stored for possible reuse.  Mr Inns said: \u0026ldquoThe Mackintosh Building will be rebuilt and will be a working art school. We will rebuild so the Mack can continue to provide creative inspiration to students, staff and visitors.  However, the plan has sparked fierce debate, with critics questioning the suggested \u0026pound200 million cost and insisting the new building would only ever be a fake Mackintosh.  Some have called for a contest for young artists and architects to design a new school while supporters insist famous buildings around the world have been rebuilt successfully.  Byrne, however, said: \u0026ldquoI really don\u0026rsquot care if they rebuild it or not \u0026ndash the soul of the art school is completely gone, never to return.  Byrne, who attended the art school in the late \u0026lsquo50s, said the ethos of the school had been lost to the crass commercialism of modern art, embodied, for him, by the New York pop artist Jeff Koons who once sold a sculpture of an orange balloon dog for $58 million.  He wrote: \u0026ldquoIn 1958, when I enrolled at Glasgow School of Art, I was in no doubt whatsoever that I was going to be working in a great work of art itself and for the next five years that\u0026rsquos what I did, growing to love it even more and to recognise that it possessed, through Mackintosh\u0026rsquos genius, a Life and Soul of its own.  He wrote that in his view, the building \u0026ldquowas no longer in use as a working art school (neither students nor staff can actually draw) but switched roles to become, instead, a \u0026lsquomuseum\u0026rsquo, then throws itself onto the funeral pyre on the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of Rennie Mackintosh\u0026rsquos birth.  He added: \u0026ldquoI believe that every genuine work of art has a soul... the GSA had a Great Soul which it gave up when \u0026lsquoArtists\u0026rsquo on the Sunday Times Rich last, together with \u0026lsquoThe Infantilist\u0026rsquo from Madison Avenue, introduced the notion that becoming rich and famous should be the goal for young \u0026lsquohopefuls\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash but, never mind, we will surely met the \u0026lsquoart\u0026rsquo we deserve."},{"url":null,"title":"more-than-43000-sign-petition-to-keep-boys-in-glasgow","story":"  Areeb Umeed Bakhsh, 13, and brother Somer, 15, fear Islamic extremists will kill them if they return to Pakistan.  They have lived in Glasgow since their family fled Pakistan in 2012 after their father was subjected to death threats due to his Christian faith.  The UK Government has repeatedly rejected the family\u0026rsquos asylum applications, largely because officials do not believe they would be at risk in Pakistan.  The family have been told they have exhausted the process and have no right to appeal but are prepared to launch a legal challenge.  The Right Reverend Susan Brown, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, supports the boys\u0026rsquo case. She said: \u0026ldquoTens of thousands of people want their names to count in the campaign to allow the Bakhsh family to stay in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThis is a family who call this country home and the uncertainty they are living with is cruel.  \u0026ldquoScotland used to be a place renowned for its welcome. We need to make sure that reputation is preserved, especially when it comes to those who have nowhere else to turn to.  The boys\u0026rsquo father, Masqood, believes the people responsible for shooting dead two Christians outside a court in Faisalabad, Pakistan, know who he is and would kill him and his family given the chance.  He said they believe he is in league with the two men who were shot after being accused of writing a pamphlet critical of the Prophet Muhammad that flouted Pakistan\u0026rsquos controversial blasphemy law, which carries the death penalty.

Officials want to use the rugged backdrop for scenes in The Long Night, set 10,000 years before the original fantasy series.  They visited Skye to seek out beauty spots that would be ideal for use as action and scenery.  Earlier this month, it was announced that work on the spin-off will begin in Belfast\u0027s Titanic Quarter Film Studios in October, the same venue used to shoot many of the indoor scenes for Game Of Thrones over its eight series, while outdoor locations around Northern Ireland have also featured.  Fans of the must-see TV drama have already created online maps featuring every location used for Game of thrones, including Doune Castle which was used for the pilot episode. Scenes have been shot around the world, including in Iceland, Malta and Croatia and all countries have benefited from a rise in tourist numbers thanks to the programme\u0027s global following.  A record 2.1million overseas tourists visited Northern Ireland in 2016, upping revenue from this sector by 12 per cent, according to Tourism Ireland figures.  Belfast Airport also had the highest passenger increase of any destination, with 388,486 more customers in 2016 than the previous year.  HBO have green-lit five prequel series and commissioned a pilot episode.  A source said: \"This would be a massive development for Skye. Game Of Thrones had a huge impact on tourist numbers wherever it was filmed. The same will most likely apply to the prequel. Skye is definitely a potential venue for the The Long Night.  \"The show is set 10,000 years before Game Of Thrones so the makers need new ideas and locations. Skye ticks a lot of boxes for them.\"  Filming of the eighth and final series of Game Of Thrones finished earlier this month in Northern Ireland.  Most of the show has been filmed there since 2010.  The scenery of Skye has proved increasingly popular for movie and TV producers in recent years, with films shot there including 2008\u0027s Made of Honour, featuring Kevin McKidd and Patrick Dempsey the Alien sequel Prometheus in 2012, Macbeth with Michael Fassbender in 2015 and Roald Dahl\u0027s The BFG in 2016.  Blockbusters Transformers: The Last Knight and King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword both shot there last year.  The prequel series is being created by Game Of Thrones author George RR Martin.  Jenni Steele, film and creative industries manager at VisitScotland, said: \"Film tourism in general is booming in Scotland in recent years with Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and Avengers: Infinity War on the big screen and Outlander continuing to prove its popularity on the small screen.  \"VisitScotland work closely with Scotland\u0027s film location offices as productions shot here not only boost the local economy during filming but also provide a shop window for the country\u0027s amazing landscapes and can have long-lasting effects for tourism.\""},{"url":null,"title":"scots-author-quintin-jardine-labels-ian-poulter-an-ahole-after-exchange-during-scottish-open","story":"  Jardine, who is also a member at the host course of Gullane, was marshalling in Saturday\u0027s third round when Poulter hit a wayward drive on the opening hole.

The study found that the number of family carers in Britain \u0026ndash 7.6 million \u0026ndash had risen by a million over the course of a decade, while the proportion of those providing 20 or more hours of help a week had increased by 4% between 2005 and 2015.  Age UK, which sponsored the research, warned more support was needed for so-called informal carers, and urged the Government to direct more funding to the care system.  Charity director Caroline Abrahams said: \u0026ldquoThe informal carers we meet at Age UK are usually deeply committed but they also often tell us that they are completely exhausted. Not only do they need more opportunities to take a break, they also require the back up of a reliable, effective social care system.  \u0026ldquoWhen informal carers are trying to cope all on their own, this is a recipe for burn out and the collapse of an arrangement which could otherwise work really well for an older person.  \u0026ldquoIt would be dangerously complacent for policymakers to assume there is an infinite supply of wonderful people able and willing to provide informal care for their loved ones. For all kinds of demographic, social and economic reasons our current system of social care is living on borrowed time \u0026ndash it urgently needs transforming and in 2018 we must make a serious start.  The report, which comes as the Government prepares to publish its green paper on social care, said family carers provided 149 million hours of care each week \u0026ndash equal to the work of four million full-time paid care-givers.  More than half (59%) of those caring for an elderly relative are women, while 19% of women in professional jobs provide care \u0026ndash up from 18% in 2005, the study added.  Caring can also have an impact on earnings, the report said, as people are more likely to work less than those without caring responsibilities.  Kathryn Petrie, Social Market Foundation economist, said: \u0026ldquoMore women with professional and managerial jobs are trying to combine work with family care.  \u0026ldquoWe know that carers are often driven to reduce their hours or leave work altogether and, without proper support for these carers, there is a risk that women are increasingly driven out of professional careers, reversing recent progress towards equality in the workforce.  The Department of Health and Social Care said its forthcoming social care green paper would look at long-term sustainable solutions for the social care system."},{"url":null,"title":"laughing-louis-pictured-with-kate-to-mark-christening","story":"  The baby prince is pictured alert and with a wide open-mouth smile as he is held upright in Kate\u0026rsquos arms.

The amendments could be used as a show of strength by the Brexiteers, who are furious at the Chequers plan, but there were signs at Westminster that Mrs May could be prepared to compromise in an effort to avert a damaging blow to her authority.  A senior Government source said \u0026ldquono decision yet had been made on whether to accept the amendments supported by arch-Eurosceptics including Jacob Rees-Mogg, Sir Bernard Jenkin, Priti Patel and Iain Duncan Smith.  A Brexiteer source said that while ministers \u0026ldquohaven\u0026rsquot yet accepted the amendments \u0026ldquoall the noise is in that direction.  Business Secretary Mr Clark was challenged about the potential revolt on the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill, often referred to as the customs bill.  On BBC Radio 4\u0026rsquos Today programme he urged Tory colleagues who \u0026ldquowant to get on with Brexit to acknowledge that the Bill was \u0026ldquoessential and should not be impeded.  Asked if there was a suggestion that ministers would accept the amendments he said: \u0026ldquoNo. The Bill is an important part of preparing for the world after Brexit and I would have thought that all colleagues would respect the fact that we need to get those preparations in place whilst having this important negotiation to make sure that our trading arrangement can continue to support prosperity in the future.  Sir Bernard told the programme that the Chequers plan was \u0026ldquodead, with opposition from both wings of the Tory party.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom afraid it is neither beloved by Remainers or Leavers.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos also quite likely to be either rejected by the EU or more demands will be made upon it so it will be even less acceptable.  Mr Rees-Mogg, the leader of the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG), played down suggestions over the weekend they were seeking to topple Mrs May, saying she still had time to change course on her proposals.  However, the danger to the Prime Minister was underlined by the disclosure that Brexiteers had set up a WhatsApp group to co-ordinate voting tactics, organised by ex-Brexit minister Steve Baker, who quit over the Chequers plan.  The Daily  reported more than 100 MPs had joined the group, more than double the 48 needed to submit letters of no confidence in the Prime Minister to force a leadership contest.  North Cornwall MP Scott Mann quit as a ministerial aide to the Treasury, the former postman saying he would not \u0026ldquodeliver a watered down Brexit.  The threat from the Brexiteers is not the only danger facing Mrs May, with pro-EU Tories tabling amendments of their own to the customs bill and the Trade Bill, which returns to the Commons on Tuesday, which would keep Britain in a customs union with the EU.  It was unclear whether they will actually press them to a vote after some pro-EU MPs backed Mrs May\u0026rsquos Chequers plan and EU white paper.  However, in a sign of just how volatile the party has become, former education secretary Justine Greening, who backed Remain, denounced the plan, saying it offered the \u0026ldquoworst of both worlds and called for a second referendum.  \u0026ldquoThe only solution is to take the final Brexit decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians, away from the backroom deals, and give it back to the people, she said in an article for The Times.  Meanwhile Boris Johnson, in his first public intervention since his resignation last week, appealed for people to take a more positive view of Britain\u0026rsquos prospects outside the EU.  In a sign that he was keeping his powder dry, he said in an article for The Daily  that he would resist \u0026ldquofor now the temptation \u0026ldquoto bang on about Brexit.  \u0026ldquoIt is time for all of us, at this critical moment in our constitutional development, to believe in ourselves, to believe in the British people and what they can do, and in our democracy, he wrote.  \u0026ldquoPeople around the world believe passionately in Britain.

The Apple Parrot drones are used by the older children to programme flight paths, manoeuvres and even aerobatic tricks for the drones to perform in order to complete set challenges - or just to impress.Andy Gould, IT Solutions Architect for Expro, said: “In an increasingly digital age, the knowledge and skills of coding are becoming more important for our next generation of school children.“We have seen the demand for apps and technology in the workplace increase exponentially, therefore future generations who can build/develop these will have a significant career advantage.“The equipment we’ve donated to the new coding club harnesses the enthusiasm shown by the pupils, allowing them to build their skills and confidence in this area.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Monday 16 Jul 2018 4:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116574.jpg","title":"High calibre medical staff recruited in Caithness","story":"\u0026nbspNHS Highland yesterday confirmed the full and part-time appointments, which include two advanced nurse practitioners and a physiotherapist.Bill Fernie, chairman of Caithness Health Action Team, said: \u0026ldquoIt is definitely good news that the posts which were empty for a long time are being filled and that is welcomed by us.\u0026ldquoThis is a success for NHS Highland but it has been a long time coming.

He will leave his present post in September, although he will be replaced.Mr Flavell thinks his clinics will provide a number of benefits for patients and practices alike.He said: \u0026ldquoTwenty-five per cent of appointments at GP practices are for muscular skeletal problems. So, in theory, my physiotherapy clinics could help to take 25 per cent off the GP\u0026rsquos workload.\u0026ldquoAnd for people aged over 75, that figure goes up to 38 per cent, so I may be able to provide even more support.Kath Jones, NHS Highland\u0026rsquos associate medical director north and west, said: \u0026ldquoThree Caithness GP practices run by NHS Highland have recently attracted six new clinicians to permanent posts including three GPs, two ANPs and a physio practitioner.\u0026ldquoThe appointment of so many high-calibre clinicians within such a short time is a credit to the quality of the teams working in these practices. The recruitment of three GPs is particularly remarkable considering a quarter of GP practices across Scotland have vacancies.\u0026ldquoThe recruitment of all the clinicians will improve the continuity of care provided by the practices while introducing access to a specialist primary care physio at the three sites.\u0026ldquoReducing the reliance on temporary locums will enable NHS Highland to save money while improving care. With two of the clinicians moving into the district to take up post, this will be good for the local economy too.Mr Armer has already taken up his post at the practice on Janet Street, Thurso.

Last November, Loganair flew Teddy over 200 miles back to Kirkwall for a tearful homecoming with his young owner.Officially launched to mark Teddy Bear Picnic Day, this Tuesday, July 10, the furry keepsakes come with their very own Loganbear luggage tags as well as outfits mirroring the tartan look and feel of the airline’s own uniforms. Throughout the summer months, children will be able to pick between a Logie or Lotti bear once they come onboard a Loganair aircraft, distributed by the airline’s flight crew.The airline is running a number of social media competitions and promotional activity featuring the bears throughout July and August and will also be launching its Instagram channel to showcase the two toys.Kay Ryan, Commercial Director at Loganair said: “We’re very much looking forward to giving some of our youngest passengers a special memory of their trip with Loganair and what better day to unveil the two newest members of our crew than Teddy Bear Picnic day.“Logie and Lotti will be flying with us all summer and our crew can’t wait to introduce them onboard.“Last year the airline did everything it could to reunite a young girl with her lost teddy so this summer we thought we’d try and share some of that joy with children travelling with us.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This includes security and airfield operations, airside services, firefighters, operations officers and passenger service agents.“Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members,\u0026#8221 said Unite regional officer Wullie Wallace.\u0026#8220The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard-working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.“Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities.

This could run into millions of pounds and put at risk the future viability of the business.The company have also met with local Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur, to express their concerns about the delay.As the start of this month, as Mr Matheson stepped into the shoes of the previous minister for transport Humza Yousaf, it was announced that lack of agreement between the Scottish Government and Pentland Ferries had led to no discounted fares being introduced in Pentland Firth ferry routes, by the Government\u0026#8217s self-set deadline of the end of last month.Andrew Banks, Managing Director and Owner of Pentland Ferries said: “We want these passenger subsidies implemented as soon as possible but we need to be 100 per cent sure that the scheme complies with state aid rules.  We have never had any subsidy from the government and even though this scheme gives money to the passenger, not the operator, the minister has told us that we would be liable for any repayment if at a future date the scheme is deemed illegal. This could run into the millions and could finish us off.“We cannot take that risk and we have a responsibility to our staff, our community and family to make sure the scheme works for everyone. We want to work with the Minister and his team to discuss a way forward so that we can all benefit from reduced fares. This scheme will be fantastic for our business, attracting more visitors to the islands and making it cheaper to travel to the mainland for residents. So we want this unlocked as soon as possible. We welcome the Minister’s willingness to gain a full understanding of the detail and very much hope to be able to meet him in Orkney soon.”The minister, Mr Matheson, was asked for a response to the comments from Pentland Ferries and Mr Banks. At the time he replied, Transport Scotland said the invitation had not yet been received so the minister could not comment.However, Mr Matheson did say: “The Scottish Government remains committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles. I am conscious that there is a great deal of interest in this issue amongst users of the services. As I begin my new role as Transport Secretary, I want to ensure that I gain a full understanding of the detail — it is already very clear to me that planning to introduce reduced fares on the Northern Isles network has been a complex and challenging piece of work.“As a first step, we will cut fares on the Aberdeen-Lerwick and Kirkwall-Lerwick services from June 30. These reductions will be around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.“On routes to Orkney, it has been necessary to engage with commercial operators on the Pentland Firth. We set out a very fair and reasonable proposal that would maintain competition, enabling them to protect their existing market share. Unfortunately, not all the commercial operators have felt able to agree to our proposals. This means we cannot currently implement reduced fares on any of the routes to and from Orkney without the risk of legal challenge.“This is both disappointing and frustrating, but I am determined to work through the issue to see what more can be done. I have asked Transport Scotland to undertake some further work to see what measures, if any, we can take. As part of that, we are willing to reopen talks with commercial operators.  I will provide a further update to stakeholders and to Parliament as soon as I can, with a view to bringing the full benefits of the scheme to the people of Orkney and Shetland.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

What’s more, on still summer evenings it’s really nice to hear the students’ voices echoing across the harbour before we set off to sail.As the Year of Young People progresses throughout 2018 Mr Garrett said that Serco Northlink will be continuing to celebrate this special year with additional partnerships with the local community and its youngest residents.”Leah Hamilton from Stromness Primary School was one of the pupils chosen for the recording, which she found very enjoyable.“It was great fun recording the announcement,\u0026#8221 she said.\u0026#8220It only took us a few attempts and we were pleased with the final message.“We know that safety is important when travelling anywhere so we hope that the new announcement will help NorthLink Ferries’ passengers listen to the briefing and follow the steps carefully.”\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It\u0026rsquos not an easy decision.\"We\u0026rsquove listened to customers, colleagues, communities and elected representatives and we continue to do so.\"We\u0026rsquove committed to making no further changes to the size of our branch network in Scotland until at least 2020 \u0026ndash and not to remove or replace, at a suitable nearby location, the branch ATM if there\u0026rsquos no other free-to-use ATM within 1km of the closing branch.\"The way our customers are banking is changing and it is important that we respond to that change. Across Scotland, usage of our branches is down 42 per cent since 2014. Only one per cent of our customers in Scotland visit their branch on a regular weekly basis. Seven in 10 customers are using mobile or online banking.\"\"We recognise that every customer will have different banking needs and we are committed to ensuring all our customers receive the best possible service.\"We\u0026rsquove invested to provide more ways to bank with us now than ever before.\"He added: \"We\u0026rsquove committed to keeping 10 branches open until the end of 2018.\"Johnston Carmichael has been appointed to carry out an independent review into these 10 branches and are meeting with local customers, representatives, employees and stakeholders in all ten communities to understand the impact of each individual closure.\"We have committed to accepting the recommendations of this review in full.\"Monday 16 Jul 2018 4:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

In more recent times, it has seen the fairytale rise of Ross County from Highland League to Premiership \u0026ndash and a notorious Town Hall appearance by the Beatles when the Fab Four were on the brink of global success.Now, history hunters are being targeted by DCDC which has sought to work with the public to create a new vision of the town.Fascinating facts are being assembled by Dingwall History Society for panels dotting the town and shining light on its rich past.Secretary\u0026nbspSandra MacDonald said: \"Dingwall has a very long and significant history and we have the information available.\"The group will gather facts and suggest significant sites worthy of interpretation but will not have the final say.Mrs MacDonald, whose late husband David \"DD\" MacDonald chaired the society for a decade, said: \"There are the obvious sites like the Tollbooth \u0026ndash the tower and the clock.\"Other sites being considered include the war memorials at Station Square and the Hector Macdonald Monument and Moot Hill in the Cromartie Memorial car park, where the Vikings are believed to have held gatherings.Mrs MacDonald added: \"A board can carry a minimum amount of information but can indicate where people can access far more online.\"DCDC secretary Robin Lingard revealed the heritage trail is one of several items being proposed by the group, set up as a charity two years ago to tap funding pots for improvements. He told a recent open meeting that membership had more than doubled. \"We are very pleased,\" he said. \"I think out of it new ideas will come forward.\"Community activist George Murray, project manager for Dingwall Means Business, targeting the establishment of a business improvement district (BID), said: \"I think the DCDC is the perfect body to spearhead and develop plans like the heritage trail. I see it as being beneficial not only for local community development and participation but also as a way of presenting our community heritage to the world, especially as we get busier with the advent of the cruise tour coaches beginning to discover the town and the success of the NC500 route.\"If suitable funding can be put in place a heritage trail round the area could be a real boon to the town.\"Dingwall councillor Angela MacLean said a trail is \"a fantastic opportunity\" to showcase the town.She said: \"Many of the DCDC group\u0026rsquos wish list buildings are in the ownership of the Highland Council and if DCDC or another local group would like to take over and run of any of these buildings I am more than happy to lend my support. I would also like to congratulate DCDC for the work they have done so far and look forward to working with them to make some of their proposals a reality over the coming years.\"\u0026bull What do you think about the idea?

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4768723.1531508582!/image/image.jpg","title":"benjamin sachs eight ethical questions about exploring outer space","story":"        Metallic shrapnel flying faster than bullets the Space Shuttle smashed to pieces astronauts killed or ejected into space.                The culprit? Space debris – remnants of a Russian satellite blown up by a Russian missile. The one survivor, Ryan Stone, has to find her way back to Earth with oxygen supplies failing and the nearest viable spacecraft hundreds of miles away. Over on Mars, 20 years in the future, an exploration mission from Earth is going wrong. An epic dust storm forces the crew to abandon the planet, leaving behind an astronaut, Mark Watney, who is presumed dead. He has to figure out how to grow food while awaiting rescue.            Hollywood knows how to terrify and inspire us about outer space. Movies like Gravity (2013) and The Martian (2015), present space as hostile and unpredictable – spelling danger for any intrepid human who dares to venture outside Earth’s hospitable confines.            This is only part of the story, however – the bit with people centre stage. Sure, no one wants to see astronauts killed or stranded in space. And we all want to enjoy the fruits of successful planetary science, like determining which planets could host human life or simply whether we’re alone in the universe.But should we care about the universe beyond how it affects us as humans? That is the big question – call it question #1 of extraterrestrial environmental ethics, a field too many people have ignored for too long. I’m one of a group of researchers at the University of St Andrews trying to change that. How we ought to value the universe depends on two other intriguing philosophical questions.READ MORE: Life on Mars a real possibility as Nasa finds ‘organic matter’Question #2: the kind of life we are most likely to discover elsewhere is microbial – so how should we view this lifeform? Most people would accept that all humans have intrinsic value, and matter not only in relation to their usefulness to someone else. Accept this and it follows that ethics places limits on how we may treat them and their living spaces.People are starting to accept that the same is true of mammals, birds and other animals. So what about microbial beings? Some philosophers like Albert Schweitzer and Paul Taylor have previously argued that all living things have a value in themselves, which would obviously include microbes. Philosophy as a whole has not reached a consensus, however, on whether it agrees with this so-called biocentrism.            Question #3: for planets and other places not hospitable to life, what value should we place on their environment? Arguably we care about our environment on Earth primarily because it supports the species that live here. If so, we might extend the same thinking to other planets and moons that can support life.But this doesn’t work for “dead” planets. Some have proposed an idea called aesthetic value, that certain things should be treasured not because they are useful but because they are aesthetically wonderful. They have applied this not only to great artistic works like Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa and Beethoven’s Fifth, but also to parts of the Earth’s environment, such as the Grand Canyon. Could that apply to other planets?Supposing we could answer these theoretical questions, we could proceed to four important practical questions about space exploration.Question #4: is there a duty to protect the environment on other planets? When it comes to sending astronauts, instruments or robots to other worlds, there are clearly important scientific reasons for making sure they don’t take terrestrial organisms with them and wind up depositing them there.            Otherwise, if we discovered life, we wouldn’t know whether it was indigenous – not to mention the risk of wiping it out entirely. But is scientific clarity all that matters, or do we need to start thinking about galactic environmental protection?READ MORE: Touch the sky: 40 years of space travelQuestion #5: what, besides biological contamination, would count as violating such an obligation to treat that planet’s environment with respect? Drilling for core samples, perhaps, or leaving instruments behind, or putting tyre tracks in the dirt?Question #6: what about asteroids? The race is well underway to develop technology to harvest the untold trillions of pounds of mineral wealth presumed to exist on asteroids, as already reported in The Conversation. It helps that no one seems to think of asteroids as environments we need to protect. The same goes for empty space. The movie Gravity gave us some human-centred reasons to be worried about the buildup of debris in space, but might there be other reasons to object? If so, would our obligation be to merely create less debris, or something stronger – like not producing any new debris or even cleaning up what we’ve left already?Question #7: what considerations might offset arguments in favour of behaving ethically in space? Of the various reasons for going there – intellectual/scientific, utilitarian, profit-driven – are any strong enough to override our obligations?            We also need to factor in the inevitable risks and uncertainties here. We can’t know what benefits space missions will have. We can’t be certain of not biologically contaminating the planets we visit. What risk/reward trade-offs should we be willing to undertake?Discussions about outer space have the advantage that we have very little attachment to anything out there. These ethical questions might therefore be some of the only ones humans can address with a large measure of emotional distance. For this reason, answering them might help us to make progress with Earth-bound issues like global warming, mass extinction and nuclear waste disposal.Space exploration also directly raises questions about our relationship to Earth – once we overcome the technological puzzles preventing the terraforming of a planet like Mars, or find ways of reaching habitable exoplanets. I’ll leave you with one extremely important one for the future:Question #8: given that the Earth is not the only potential home for human beings, what reasons for protecting its environment would remain once we can realistically go somewhere else?Benjamin Sachs is a senior lecturer in philosophy at St Andrews University.

Theresa May\u0026#8217s leadership has been plunged into fresh turmoil over Brexit after warring Tory MPs condemned her \u0026#8220common rulebook\u0026#8221 plan to broker the UK\u0026#8217s departure from the EU.                The Prime Minister suffered another resignation last night and was branded a “Remainer who has remained a Remainer” over the Chequers proposal, which sceptics fear will mean the UK remains a “rule taker” from Brussels.            The stand-off with some of her MPs is set to intensify this week as she faces a series of tests in the House of Commons. A potentially damaging resignation speech from former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is feared, along with critical votes on key Brexit legislation.            Escalating Tory tensions prompted trade minister Lord Duncan, a key ally of the Prime Minister, to warn hardline Brexiteer MPs against a potential leadership challenge.Mrs May yesterday insisted that her controversial plan for trade in goods after Brexit is a “good deal” for the UK and urged MPs to get behind it.She has been under pressure since publication of the plan last week prompted the shock resignations of David Davis as Brexit Secretary and Mr Johnson as Foreign Secretary. Last night, Robert Courts quit as Parliamentary Private Secretary in the Foreign Office, citing his discontent with the Chequers plan.“I had to think who I wanted to see in the mirror for the rest of my life,” he said in a resignation statement.Mrs May admitted yesterday she had to make changes to the UK’s initial Brexit blueprint to meet trade concerns of the EU.            She told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “We needed to come forward with another option in order to ensure that we can get those negotiations on trade – the clock is ticking.“But this is a deal that has benefits. Our companies will abide by these rules anyway. Giving them frictionless borders means that the jobs that depend on that frictionless trade will be protected.“It means we deliver on the Northern Ireland border. It means we have got benefits out of this deal. This is a good deal for the UK.” The revised approach, she added, came after the EU offered two options for a deal – neither of which was acceptable to the UK.She acknowledged that there were strong feelings about the terms of Britain’s withdrawal. “Many people voted from the heart to leave the European Union. My job as Prime Minister is to deliver for them,” she said.            “But also I have got to be hard-headed and practical about this and do it in a way that ensures we get the best interests for the UK.”Mrs May denied that Mr Davis had been “cut out” of the plan and therefore had no choice but to resign.But he hit out at the proposed common rulebook with the EU at the weekend. He said: “None of this really amounts to taking back control. “What is more, it is likely that the EU, having achieved a break in the UK’s position, will simply pocket the concessions and ask for more. For that reason alone this is a very bad decision.”Mr Davis insisted the climbdown on regulation is far from an “arcane technicality”. He said: “It would mean that the UK is simply not running its own economy.            “How laws are made is also a central indicator of whether we have a functioning democracy. If Parliament determines laws, we have one. Otherwise, we do not.”Another leading Brexiteer, Jacob Rees-Mogg, also went on the offensive, branding the common rulebook plan as a “retreat” which effectively means obeying EU laws. “The government unfortunately believes that Brexit is not a good thing in itself,” he said.“The Prime Minister said people voted with their hearts and she’s doing something with her head – in my view and in the view of most Brexiteers, head and heart come together.“Brexit is enormously positive, a huge opportunity for the country, and I’m afraid the Prime Minister doesn’t see that. It is why I think she is a Remainer who has remained a Remainer.”Mrs May has said her plan would end both the free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the UK. But Mr Rees-Mogg said the ECJ would have a role that is “effectively the same as it has now”. Tory MPs are believed to be close to hitting the 48 “no confidence” letters they need to trigger a leadership contest. Although it seems unlikely that such a vote would see half of Tory MPs vote her out as party leader, the Prime Minister declined to say whether she would stay and contest such a battle if it was instigated.However, Lord Duncan called for party unity, saying: “Anyone who thinks they might write a letter needs to stop and think about what the effects eventually would be. “Actually I think she would win any vote of confidence hands down if it were to come to that. “But the very fact people think they might do this is utterly destructive, utterly unnecessary and they should back her to the hilt.”MPs will today vote on amendments to the Customs Bill tabled by members of the European Research Group, which Mr Rees-Mogg leads, intended to scupper her plans for a “UK-EU free trade area” based on a common rulebook.With no Labour backing, the changes stand little chance of getting through, although the votes could provide Conservative Brexiteers with the opportunity to stage a show of strength in Parliament.Mrs May could face a further challenge tomorrow, this time from pro-EU Tories seeking to amend the Trade Bill to keep the UK in a customs union with the EU,  although it is unclear whether they will now put it to a vote.Former Brexit minister Steve Baker, who quit with Mr Johnson and Mr Davis, said the Chequers plan was drawn up in the Cabinet Office while the Department for Exiting the EU had been reduced to a sham “Potemkin structure”."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4769119.1531742883!/image/image.jpg","title":"politicians should be looking to emulate gareth southgate","story":"        Has  the warm reception for mild-mannered Gareth Southgate \u0026#8211 even in Scotland \u0026#8211 given notice to the braggarts and buffoons, asks Gina Davidson                If the answer is Gareth, what is the question?            So went one rather snide headline five years ago when Gareth Southgate was appointed as England’s under-21s manager. Not an adventurous choice was the message – certainly not a revolutionary one.            The same doubts were still being voiced when Roy Hodgson quit as the English manager after Euro 2016. How could Southgate, who became infamous for missing the vital penalty in the semi-final shoot-out against Germany in Euro 1996, really be the one to make England great again? The men in grey suits decided he wasn’t. But when blustering, bluffing, barrel-chested Sam Allardyce was forced to resign from the post – after just 67 days and one game in charge – Southgate found the ball at his feet and the fans, immediately, on his back.Well, where are they now, as Delia Smith might well ask?Just look and you’ll see them: singing songs about Southgate and his team proudly waving the St George’s flag increasing sales of M\u0026ampS navy waistcoats in emulation of their new icon.Of course, they’re disappointed that England won’t actually win this year’s World Cup, but the thrill of making it to the semis for the first time since 1990 – of a Russian odyssey far beyond their expectations – and the excitement of a young, multicultural team full of potential, well it’s something to sing about.            And at the helm stands an apparently decent, affable, modest man, with a wonky nose, a waistcoat and the most English of teeth.So if the answer is indeed Gareth – what then is the question?According to Tim Samuels, former presenter of BBC’s The Men’s Room and author of a lighthearted dissection of modern day masculinity, Who Stole My Spear?, the question could be, what does a modern male role model look like?“The way Southgate conducts himself is a modern, and refreshing, form of masculinity. He’s not involved with flashy nonsense, he’s not macho – yet he’s still achieving success,” says Samuels. “In a world of Trump and Weinstein, he’s a real antidote.            “Politics has become a macho pissing contest. We used to roll our eyes at American politics, but you look at many of our current politicians and you know they are motivated by ego and not national interest because most of them have a mental age stuck in their public school days. “Then Southgate comes along and for him it’s all about the national interest and being part of a real team – there are very few figures on the public stage you can say that about.“He comes across as a really decent bloke, willing to admit faults, not swept up in arrogance and hubris. There’s an ideal model of Englishness around fair play and decency and Southgate does seem to epitomise that at a time when our politics has gone into some kind of hysterical realm.”Decent, affable, modest – humble even. These are the qualities ascribed to Southgate that have made him the poster boy for team spirit and steadfastness in what are tumultuous times in Britain. They’re qualities that saw many Scots drop their “Anyone But England” footballing support during this World Cup and reluctantly back the auld sporting enemy – and that even won round hardline football haters.“I don’t watch football. I hate it, and everything that surrounds it, because I find it all a very toxic form of masculinity,” says Caroline Criado-Perez, the feminist campaigner and writer. “But I found myself watching the last two England games and the football news in between them and beginning to care about it, and that’s because of Gareth Southgate.”             She laughs at her transformation. “I love Gareth Southgate, so does my mum and every woman I know. My mum now wants to properly follow the England team.“There’s something so lovely about him and the way he treats his team. He just seems like he would be a really good dad and there’s something so lovely about someone like that being the person that, at the moment, is the most loved man in the country.“And the players themselves seem such nice boys, I really feel affection for them. They are a real team, very together, and I think that’s the way Southgate has trained them. It’s also great that kids get to see you don’t have to be some macho, alpha-male type of masculinity in order to be well respected and powerful and successful.“Like Samuels, Criado-Perez believes that the unity Southgate has inspired has also been provoked by a “desperation” to see decency among male leaders. “Look at the way the cabinet is behaving… David Davis, Boris Johnson… that is the epitome of toxic masculinity,” she says. “We’re desperate for something good, something positive right now when everything else is so bleak. To know there are good people, good men still out there is heartening.” Southgate’s own professional story has without doubt, added to the warmth felt towards him throughout the World Cup. He has certainly known public humiliation and how it feels to hit rock bottom professionally.“When you have been through what I have,” Southgate said back in October 2014, “first of all in 1996, then losing the job at Middlesbrough – having had to manage in the Premier League with no experience at 35 – I think I can cope with anything, really.”Southgate was 20 when he made his professional playing debut for Crystal Palace before going on to play for Aston Villa and then Middlesbrough – at the same time gaining 57 caps for England. In 2006 he became Middlesbrough manager, but was sacked when the club were relegated from the Premier League three years later. From those ashes grew his career in coaching with the Football Association. He was made the head of elite development, working with Sir Trevor Brooking to establish how best to bring through future footballing stars – perhaps he is now reaping what he sowed back then.He had a brief spell as a TV football pundit before going back to the FA to take on the under-21s manager’s role – deliberately ruling out doing any television work at the same time. “I want to be recognised as a coach and committed to that and don’t want there to be any perception that I’ve got a life-raft there in case things don’t work out,” he said.“I had a period of stepping back and being a bit comfortable and I wanted a challenge that will be tough. I don’t see the point of doing things in life if they’re not difficult.” There can hardly be, in football, a job more difficult than the one he has now, or a crown more heavy. Yet at 48, he seems to wear it lightly.“He has an amazing personal story coming from rock bottom after that penalty miss, facing such a public low, a public humiliation, to very quietly building himself back up and, in the face of doubters, being successful,” says Samuels.“That no doubt leads to how he relates to his players. He has almost a big-brotherly, fraternal relationship with the players. “He’s very encouraging, he puts his arm around them and not many managers do that. He’s emotionally intuitive and he keeps them grounded. And, of course, he shared a very public hug with his wife at the end.“Southgate has set the tone and the players have followed his lead – it has helped, of course, that they are a younger team.”Unspun presenter and comedian – and former Labour Party adviser – Matt Forde is unashamedly emotional about the journey he’s gone on with Southgate and the England team during the World Cup. “Oh god I love him,” he sighs. “He has such dignity – something we’ve not come to expect from football. He’s not a blowhard, he thinks about more than just football, he has filled a hole beyond football. “Britain is divided and Southgate has a type of masculinity which is much needed right now. Polite, dignified, confident, sensible. He’s what we all need. He’s what some politicians should be looking to emulate.”Forde adds: “I always liked him as a player but when he was made manager I thought it was a pretty unremarkable appointment. But he’s shown he has the level of intelligence required for international football and he’s given a young side so much confidence – he’s a master of psychology. He’s also been able to create a bond between the team and the fans. We’ve had more access to them and their stories and how they think in a way we never did when it was a team of Lampard and Neville, who were shut off from us all.”Samuels also believes Southgate’s approach has meant a reconnection between team and fans. “There’s been a disconnect between players and fans over the years when players have come across as prima donnas, more concerned with WAGs and social media than with playing for the team.“I went to university in Scotland and I was there during the 1998 World Cup, and as much as I would always support England, I did wince when I saw the St George’s Cross as it represented a certain nationalism and jingoism which I wasn’t comfortable with. I was always very jealous of Scottish fans, travelling abroad and spreading joy and laughter and English fans spreading broken chairs and racist chants. I wanted us to be more like the Scots. Under Southgate there’s been a change – we’ve moved in that direction and have lost the arrogance.”Forde takes umbrage at the “English arrogance cliché”. “It’s a generalisation and I resent it,” he says. “I think it’s ludicrous to expect other parts of the UK to support England – it’s a sporting rivalry after all. The vast majority of English fans have no arrogant belief that we are the best – results over the years definitely prove otherwise – and the vast majority behave when they go abroad, it’s always the minority that gain the headlines.“But Southgate has won a lot of neutrals over. And that’s really heartening. It means so much to hear someone from Scotland or Wales or Ireland say they actually support England – it’s really emotional because it’s so rare to be cast in a positive light.“Football is emotional. Twenty years on from missing that penalty Gareth Southgate has had redemption. That kind of narrative is what makes it so great.”  Of course, it’s easy to extrapolate too much from sporting victories and losses – already the fact that Croatia, a country of just four million, made it to the final is being held up as a shining example for the Scottish national squad – but could there be some more permanent change in our national discourse, in how male leaders conduct themselves, from the passion Southgate has inspired? Samuels is doubtful. “It all reminds me of 2012 and the Olympics and that feeling that we were a confident, cool country. But that seems a very long time ago and I have a horrible feeling that when politics resumes its business as usual our current feelings will fade away again like the summer heat. “But maybe it will come back again in two years for the Euros.”Forde, who admits to shedding more than a few tears – and rewatching the scenes of Southgate consoling the players and thanking fans – is more positive: “He’s resurrected English football. Perhaps now we know what we really want in our leaders he will have helped set us on a more progressive, unified course as a country. It’s good to have hope.”Right now though, a bloke called Gareth, dad of two and former pupil of Crawley comprehensive Hazelwick School, is the icon for ideals that seem absent among other male leaders. Johnson, Gove, Davis, Rees-Mogg, Fox – you boys have taken a hell of a beating."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4768262.1531468928!/image/image.jpg","title":"progress at north sea s catcher field gives boost to premier","story":"        Premier Oil has hailed progress at a major North Sea field.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

Any avoidable delay in receiving essential treatment is unacceptable.\n\u0026#8220Many of these passengers have been waiting for their appointments for months if not years, and have no way to access the treatment and specialists they need at home.\n\u0026#8220Travelling out with the isles for medical treatment is already stressful for vulnerable isles residents without the added anxiety caused by cancellations. Rescheduling appointments is not easy for those living in remote communities and patients may have a lengthy wait for another opportunity to travel.\n\u0026#8220The right to strike is an important one and I understand that strikes have to cause disruption in order to be effective.\n\u0026#8220But, I urge your members to carefully consider this compromise: Loganair flights from the North Isles use smaller aircraft which require a lower level of fire service cover.\n\u0026#8220Therefore, Unite members could guarantee a minimum level of fire and security coverage on the proposed strike dates, allowing life-line Orkney and Shetland flights to continue for essential medical travel.\n\u0026#8220I hope further discussions will resolve the dispute before any strike action goes ahead and that the needs of North Isles passengers are at the forefront of your decision making.\u0026#8221\nMeanwhile, Loganair is giving passengers in Shetland the chance to change their flights.\nAbout 170 members, including key airport staff, security workers and firefighters have voted in favour of striking – with more talks expected next week involving conciliation service Acas.\nTwenty-four-hour strikes are planned for Friday 20th July as well as on Thursday 2nd August and Thursday16th August.\nLoganair managing director Jonathan Hinkles said passengers could change their flights free of charge.\nHe said: “Although there is still time for the strike to be averted and we hope it will be, we are offering customers booked to fly to or from Aberdeen on the strike dates the opportunity to change their travel date or route if they wish.\n\u0026#8220This is free of charge and designed to offer certainty of alternatives for those booked to travel.\n\u0026#8220We also have contingency plans to operate Aberdeen flights to alternate airports on strike days if this does go ahead, and will announce details of those if this action cannot be averted. Our website is up to date with the latest information.”\nUnite regional officer Wullie Wallace expected talks with Acas next week. The dispute is over pay for airport workers. A total of 88 per cent of workers rejected the latest pay offer.\nThe union said members had rejected two below-inflation wage offers on the back of below inflation increases over the last two years.\nMr Wallace said: \u0026#8220Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members. The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.\n\u0026#8220Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities. It’s high time for the company to invest in its employees. Unite remains open to further discussions with a view to resolving the dispute.\u0026#8221\nAn unattributed quote from an Aberdeen spokesman stated: \u0026#8220We have been informed by Unite of their intention to take industrial action on Friday 20th July.\n\u0026#8220This follows the rejection of our proposed pay offer. We believe we have made an offer that is entirely fair and reasonable and we are committed to continuing discussions to reach a resolution acceptable to all parties.\n\u0026#8220We have made contact with Acas which has agreed to mediate between both parties. We are seeking a suitable date to continue our discussions in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable position.\n\u0026#8220We will, as a matter of course, ensure contingency plans are in place in the event of any planned industrial action.”\nI am amazed that the Scottish Government will allow a union to hold hostage urgent healthcare for 45,000 citizens in Shetland and Orkney.

Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s

the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nMonday 16 Jul 2018 4:40

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

Sabhal Mòr Ostaig principal Prof Boyd Robertson said, \u0026#8220This is a richly-deserved honour for Duncan which recognises the hugely important contribution he has made to the development of the college over many years and the vital contribution he has made to the development of the Gaelic language and culture and to the advancement of Gaelic and Gaelic-medium education, both as a teacher and as a former HM Inspector.”\n“Duncan\u0026#8217s critical input to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig’s development in its challenging formative years was marked by his steady stewardship, as a former chairman and his pioneering work, alongside that of his fellow trustees, demonstrated an exemplary vision and commitment without which what is now the National Centre for the Gaelic Language and Culture would not have existed.”\n“For that, all who have benefited from this wonderful and inspiring place, over the intervening years, owe him a great debt of gratitude and it is for that reason we celebrate with him here today.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve.

We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales-large.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27407  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nDuring the course of the delegation\u0026#039s visit, young people who took part in the campaign from across the north and the border region in the European Parliament in Brussels where they will have the opportunity to raise their concerns with EU legislators. - Martina Anderson\nYoung people from north and south will be in the European Parliament in Brussles today to discuss how Brexit will impact their lives. \nThey are travelling as part of a delegation hosted by Sinn Féin MEP Martina Anderson to highlight the One Thing campaign, an initiative designed to give young people a platform to raise their concerns over Brexit. \nOver the last number of months, young people from across Irelandwereencouraged to take to social media to highlight the one thing about Brexit that most concerns them. \nLarge numbers of young people from north and south took part in the campaign and their views have now been compiled into a report which will be presented to the EU\u0027s Brexit negotiating team in Brussels during the delegations\u0027s visit. \nSpeaking from Brussels, Martina Anderson said: \n\"Earlier this year I launched the One Thing campaign which was designed to give young people the opportunity to use social media platforms to highlight how Brexit will impact on them. \n\"They responded with concerns about their education, European study programmes, freedom of movement, the rights of women, equality, workers\u0027 rights and many other issues. \n\"During the course of the delegation\u0027s visit, young people who took part in the campaign from across the north and the border region in the European Parliament in Brussels where they will have the opportunity to raise their concerns with EU legislators. \n\"They will also present a report on the One Thing campaign to those conducting the Brexit negotiations on behalf oF the EU. \n\"This is all part of my pledge to ensure that the voices of the people of the north are heard and listened to in Europe.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27408  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nFormer Louth TD and republican ex-prisoner Paddy Agnew was in Leinster House for the first time today, 37 years after being elected. \nPaddy Agnew was one of three republican prisoners elected during the 1981 hunger strikes while imprisoned in Long Kesh and taking part in the blanker protest. \nHe was elected in the 1981 general election, topping the poll in the Louth constituency.

We are getting ready for a busy summer season and are sure the visitors will enjoy the improved gardens on site.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n    try { _402_Show() } catch(e) {}    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.7966667.1495101436!/image/image.jpg","title":"in full all 18 venues for this year s twelfth of july demonstrations","story":"\nThe Orange Institution has confirmed the 18 venues across Northern Ireland which will host Twelfth of July demonstrations this summer.\n\n\t\t\t\t\nPreparations are at an advanced stage for the largest day in the parading calendar, with upwards of an estimated half-a-million people expected to participate or spectate in what is widely regarded as the largest annual festival in the Province.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAs is tradition, Armagh will once again host the biggest Twelfth gathering ‘in the world’ as Orangemen and women from across the county congregate in the village of Richhill.
