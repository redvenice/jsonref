So far Pfizer and Moderna\u0027s studies have only looked at how people given two doses react to the South African variant, and Britain has decided to delay giving people two doses to get more people jabbed quickly.Johnson \u0026amp Johnson confirmed last week that its world-first single shot jab, which Britain has pre-ordered 30million doses of, blocked 57 per cent of coronavirus infections in South Africa, which meets the World Health Organization\u0027s 50 per cent efficacy threshold and hints that one shot may be enough to fend off the new strain. That jab is expected to be rolled out in the coming months once it seals approval.Studies into Oxford UniversityAstraZeneca\u0027s jab, which Britain has ordered 100million doses of and is already dishing out to the most vulnerable, and the South African strain are still ongoing. Reacting to today\u0027s announcement, Professor Jonathan Ball, a molecular virologist at the University of Nottingham, said: \u0027We know that some coronavirus variants might be less easily killed by antibodies raised against some of the existing vaccines, but the levels of immunity are hopefully still sufficient to prevent serious disease. \u0027But we can\u0027t be certain that vaccine immunity might not be adversely impacted, especially after a single dose, which is why it is important to try to prevent these variants from spreading widely. \u0027That will mean effective social distancing and identifying where the variants are currently circulating, so we can stop them in their tracks through effective testing, track and trace and isolating infected iniduals.\u0027The South African variant carries 21 mutations, some of which change the shape of the spike protein, which the virus uses to bind to human cells, on its outside. The two worrying mutations it carries are known as E484K and N501Y.N501Y appears to make it better able to stick to the cells inside the body and makes it more likely to cause infection and faster to spread. This is the same mutation found on the Kent variant, which is at least 50 per cent more infectious than regular Covid and possibly more deadly.Scientists believe E484K may be associated with an ability to evade parts of the immune system called antibodies. Researchers suspect this is the case because strains with this mutation have been shown to reinfect people who caught and beat older versions of Covid.  Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, added: \u0027The presence of the \u0027South African\u0027 variant of the Covid-19 coronavirus in the UK has been recorded previously but has ultimately been linked to travel there. \u0027This variant not only appears to spread rapidly, but there is emerging evidence to suggest that it is less susceptible to immunity induced by the current crop of vaccines. The discovery of a handful of cases with no links to travel to Africa, indicates that it might be more widespread in the community than previously thought.\u0027Detecting this is a success story for the UK\u0027s coronavirus genome sequencing programme. This spread, even if small in scale, needs to be brought under control quickly, so Public Health England\u0027s house-to-house checks, and intensive testing are the right thing to do. Anyone testing positive for the coronavirus must isolate to stop the spread.\u0027Professor Rowland Kao, Professor of Veterinary Epidemiology and Data Science, University of Edinburgh, said: \u0027The identification of cases of the SA variant in people with no obvious travel links (either travel themselves, or links to other known cases) suggest that, at the very least, they were infected while in the UK – i.e. there is evidence of local transmission. \u0027As only 5 per cent of cases are tested to determine if they are the variant, there is a high probability that further local cases are in circulation – making it more difficult at the spread of the variant can be contained. \u0027Surge testing, i.e where all residents will be offered a PCR test via post will aim therefore to identify variant clusters and extent of spread, but is highly dependent on iniduals taking up those tests, as it remains a voluntary activity. \u0027As there is some evidence that current vaccines may be at least somewhat less effective against this variant, slowing its spread via surge testing and maintaining travel restrictions to prevent it jumping to other areas of the UK (if it has not done so already) will be important to keep COVID-19 infections continuing downwards at its current trajectory.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Two thirds Londons ultra Orthodox Jewish community Covid year","story":"Share this articleCOVID-19: Need for haredi communal life outweighs virus risks - analysis - The Jerusalem Post"},{"url":null,"title":"Scotlands medic blames countrys sluggish vaccine rollout GPs dont work Sunday","story":"Share this article Facing questions about why Scotland appeared to be rolling out its vaccination programme at a slower pace than across the rest of the UK, Ms Sturgeon yesterday said: \u0027There\u0027s a long way to go in this programme and it\u0027s really important we do it methodically, sustainably - concentrating on the most vulnerable first.\u0027That\u0027s what we have been doing and I think as we go through this week we will see further evidence that is what is happening.\u0027She also claimed the Government had \u0027adapted our estimates\u0027 since the Health Secretary said a million people could be vaccinated by the end of January, but it was \u0027firmly on track\u0027 with the revised targets for over-70s and the most clinically vulnerable.Scotland has entered the second phase of its plan to give the population a vaccine to combat coronavirus with two new mass vaccination centres opening on Monday.The facilities at Aberdeen\u0027s P\u0026ampJ Live venue and the Edinburgh International Conference Centre (EICC) will be able to inoculate an extra 27,000 people per week.NHS staff spent last week vaccinating each other as part of their inductions at the centres. "},{"url":null,"title":"Pete Buttigieg Senate confirmed openly gay cabinet secretary","story":"Share this article \u0027We are prepared to make sure that we use all relevant authorities to enforce the President\u0027s executive order to ensure that across all modes of transportation, workers, passengers, commuters are protected,\u0027 Buttigieg said during his January 21 confirmation hearing.  Buttigieg also agreed to work with lawmakers on the long-stalled Gateway tunnel project, which would replace the crumbling Amtrak and commuter railroad tunnel between New York City and New Jersey. While former President Donald Trump was a native New Yorker, the project was held up under his watch. \u0027We need to build our economy back, better than ever, and the Department of Transportation can play a central role in this, by implementing President Biden\u0027s infrastructure vision,\u0027 Buttigieg said in his opening remarks before the committee.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday that Buttigieg would appear in the briefing room when the administration decides to roll out a larger infrastructure package.  Under Trump, another openly gay public servant, Richard Grenell, briefly held the cabinet-level position of Director of National Intelligence. The appointment was only temporary, so he wasn\u0027t Senate-confirmed.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Look size Shocking moment 6ft SNAKE Scottish construction site","story":"Share this article \u0027I would urge anyone who may come across a snake not to approach it, but to call police reporting its position.

Now, they have both been honoured for their contributionsAmong the household names featured on the new year honours list, you’ll find hundreds of key workers and community champions who stepped up during the pandemic and made a huge inidual impact.Here, we meet two of them: a child and adolescent psychiatrist and a pub general manager who, thanks to their innovative thinking, enriched the lives of those in their community – and beyond.“During the pandemic, people Zoomed, Skyped and connected with families digitally, so why can’t we connect healthcare the same way,” asks consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist Prof Alka Surajprakash Ahuja, from Cardiff, who was awarded an MBE for her services to the NHS during Covid-19. Ahuja received the honour for her pivotal role in setting up the pioneering NHS Wales Video Consulting Service, which digitally connects patients with clinicians.The programme’s success means the focus was extended to care homes, too. “That was a place where we had the most vulnerable people who needed help, but professionals were very limited in terms of access. It allowed GPs to do virtual rounds, continuing to provide the support and care they needed.” Dentistry, optometry and pharmacy followed, with video appointments revolutionising the way a growing number of patients accessed healthcare. Ahuja’s research into video appointments also led her to investigate their value for schools. “We know schools are not going to be the same for a long, long time. But children and young people still need support for their mental and physical health, so that will hopefully enable remote delivery of care into school settings,” she says.The technology has proved life-changing. “One of our first patients was an elderly gentleman living on his own. He had an appointment with the oncologist – it was a newly diagnosed tumour that was probably cancerous. He was very anxious, which was understandable. What helped was his daughter in London and his son in Singapore could join the appointment virtually, which under normal circumstances wouldn’t be possible. It meant having family for the appointment was much more reassuring and helped contain his anxiety. When we spoke to him, he was in tears. He said: ‘My god, I just couldn’t believe it – it was like my daughter and son sitting next to me in the appointment.’”Despite the punishing workload, witnessing the results has made it worthwhile. “I think one thing that kept us going was that we all believed this was going to make a difference,” she says. “I still remember the day I left my clinical job – it was hard because I thought I’m not going to see my patients and it’s going to be next to impossible. My colleague said: ‘Don’t worry, you’re making history’ and I laughed. Now, I think what we have done has been amazing. Post-Covid, healthcare is not going to be the same – it’s going to change the landscape.”As general manager of the Portsmouth Arms in Basingstoke, Richard Curtis was awarded a BEM for services to charity and the community in Hampshire during the pandemic. At the time of the announcement, he had raised £52,500 for charity through the virtual pub quizzes he has hosted on Facebook since the outbreak of the pandemic. With a modest goal of £150, his first quiz – which began the day after pubs closed last March – quickly gained traction, turning into a nightly occurrence. “I never expected it to be anything other than my regulars who come to the pub, and to maybe attract a bit of a local audience,” he says. “We didn’t expect it to go worldwide.”Curtis, who estimates he’s now held around 300 online quizzes since March and is still going strong, has seen his efforts bring together people from around the globe in a bid to help alleviate loneliness and isolation. With the first quiz drawing around 120 participants, at its peak up to 1,500 people were joining online.“From March, it very quickly went from one quiz a week to 18,” he says. “We were doing a children’s one Monday to Friday, which I hosted with my children. I was then doing an adult one every night, and then on Saturday and Sunday I did a themed quiz at three o’clock, another at five, then an adults’ one at eight.”With each quiz filmed inside the pub (Curtis lives upstairs with his wife and three children) it offered “the feel of the pub” for those missing it. “I made a rule that if people couldn’t come to the pub, I wouldn’t be drinking, but that soon turned into people saying: ‘If we donate £200, will you have a beer?’”The biggest quiz – a world record attempt held across VE Day weekend that lasted an astonishing 35 hours – raised more than £21,000 for charity (the world record status is still pending). “The money we raised was beyond anybody’s belief. That weekend there was so much hope for what people could have done, and what they were actually allowed to do,” he says of the weekend, falling during the first national lockdown.The world record attempt was surprisingly gruelling, he says. “I just imagined I’d have to write loads of questions and stay awake. But sitting in that position for so long, my back was shot to pieces. And while staying awake for so long isn’t a problem, constantly talking for that amount of time is. Because I’d been talking for so long, my throat and tongue had swollen up so much that I couldn’t eat. I tried to eat a bacon sandwich at one point and choked, I just couldn’t swallow it.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Here’s how to make life a little easier for yourself and your children With schools shut for the foreseeable future to all except the children of critical workers and vulnerable children as the government tries to help stop the spread of Covid-19, you may find yourself struggling to know how best to support your child’s learning from home. Many of us are feeling completely overwhelmed by having to educate our children remotely again, nearly 11 months into the pandemic, often while juggling our own work commitments.As a parent, it’s only natural to worry about the impact of such disruption on a child’s educational progress and wellbeing. With children of all ages currently out of school with no definitive return date, it is difficult to know what they “should” be achieving on a day-to-day basis and how you can help them get the most out of this unpredictable time. So we spoke to Emma Marshall – a senior school headteacher, and clinical child psychologist Dr Kate Mason, to find out the real impact of this continuing situation on children and their top five tips on how we can really help them.Emma Marshall is headteacher at Havelock academy in Grimsby. Her main focus during the current lockdown is to ensure that parents and students have easy access to all of the tools needed to continue learning online, in a way that supports their needs as a family. She says that although she is a teacher, she also faces real challenges as a mum in overseeing the remote learning of her 12-year-old daughter and 17-year-old son. She recommends:1 Make it suit your family situationEveryone’s home situation and setup is different and as a headteacher my priority is to make sure that our parents and students feel supported, and know how to easily access the learning resources provided. Along with live lessons, we’re also putting together paper packs of work for those who would really struggle accessing everything online as we understand that not everyone has the technology, or perhaps it’s just not suitable for their learning style or their family situation. The main thing to remember is that we are here for you, so if something just isn’t working for you or your child with regards to the lessons being provided, tell us so that we can help. Don’t feel you’re alone in this because I guarantee nearly every parent and teacher will be feeling the same in some regards.2 Prioritise some sort of routineIf nothing else, I would absolutely encourage parents to make sure their kids get up, get showered and dressed and not spend the day in their pyjamas. That way, when they sit down to do some work, it’s mentally like they’re approaching an actual school day. (However, I think putting school uniforms on might be a step too far!) In the first few days of this lockdown I’d return home from work to find our 12-year-old daughter with her laptop, under a duvet and still in her pyjamas. So I said no. Now she knows she must brush her teeth, get washed and dressed and eat something nutritious at a sensible lunchtime – as she would do normally. Because they will have to come back to school at some point. Straying too far from a normal routine and good habits will just make the return to normality even harder.3 Check in with your childTalk to your children – ask them how they’re doing and, most importantly, how they’re feeling. Ask them to tell you five things they’ve learned that day. And remember to reward them. It doesn’t have to be with physical rewards, it can just be a “well done” when you can see that they’ve attempted to do something. Praise goes a long way, especially at the moment. Make sure your child knows that they can get in touch with their school with any problems at all – however big or small it seems to them, their teacher will want to know if they’re struggling in any way whatsoever. Encourage daily exercise away from the screen. They may have some amazing online provision but they don’t want to be in front of their screens all day. Getting out and having a walk is really important. Reading a book, engaging with pets and speaking to their friends is all to be encouraged, as much as the home learning.4 You don’t have to do everythingDon’t try to do everything that the school is setting. I promise that nobody is going to tell you that you’re doing a terrible job. I think it’s important that we think back to our school days and remember the pressure we all felt without the pandemic, so don’t make them try to achieve everything they’ve been set in school, from home. If you could do that, you wouldn’t need school in the first place. Don’t get hung up on it not looking like a normal school day – there’s no way it can do at the moment. As parents, we’re not teachers and experts. Even looking at my daughter’s year 8 maths makes my head spin! My role is to make sure she has somewhere safe and warm to work, that she has some vague routine, and then to say “well done” at the end of each day.5 Encourage your children to look to the futureI understand why parents, and students, are concerned about the future after all of this, especially those facing exams. My son is due to be off to university hopefully in September. Thankfully he’d worked hard up until this point but now he is a bit like: “Well, I might not even be doing my exams now so is there any point?” We need to keep reminding our children – and ourselves – that the future isn’t cancelled. This will end and things will go back to normal. Encourage them to keep looking forward and thinking about what is happening next. What subjects do they want to take? What are their plans for sixth form? What do they want to do at university? The future isn’t all out of the window, it’s very much just round the corner.Dr Kate Mason is a clinical psychologist specialising in children and young people at rootspsychologygroup. She understands through her job – and also firsthand as a mother – the impact that the continuing pandemic is having on the wellbeing of our children, and also the stress that it is causing parents. She recommends:1 Your relationship with your child is your number one priorityLast March, when we went into the first lockdown, my six-year-old just refused to do the home learning, so this time around I decided not to jeopardise my relationship with my son just to get him to do a bit of maths. I really do believe that in the grand scheme of their lifetime’s education, the younger ones especially will bounce back from this relatively short period of instability. Once I started thinking about it like that, I thought it is not worth the constant fallout. I emailed his teacher and said that I would get him to do what I could, but that a good, happy relationship with him is my first priority.2 Your frustration is coming from a good placeDuring that time when I was losing it over my inability to make my son do his maths and handwriting, I took a step back and asked myself: “Why am I so angry?” And I realised that I was angry because I was scared. I was scared for his education and that it was going to have a massive impact on his life. Understand that is where your upset and frustration is likely to be coming from – ultimately a good place, a place of love for your child.3 Keep calm … and make a visual timetableWhen children are calm, they are more able to learn. And kids feel calm, safe and contained – and then thrive – when there’s predictability and when they know what is coming next. Make a visual timetable with them peppered with lots of down time and fun stuff and most importantly something to look forward to at the end of the day. It’s vital to keep them looking forward. Treat yourself with calmness and self-compassion too. Remember, you are not their teacher. You can lead a horse to water, you can’t always make it drink. Nearly all children will listen to people who aren’t their immediate family, but they are designed to push your buttons. If this happens stop and take a break. Go and play a game, get their brains to calm down a bit – and only then come back and try again.The government is investing more than £400m to support disadvantaged children and young people with access to technology through the pandemic, including 1.3m laptops and tablets.The Department for Education has partnered with some of the UK’s leading mobile network operators to provide free data to disadvantaged families, further supporting remote education where it’s needed. Families will benefit from this additional data until July 2021.54,000 4G wireless routers have been provided, with free data for the academic year, to support disadvantaged children to access remote education and vital social care services.For more guidance on remote learning and support for mental health and wellbeing, visit: gov.ukcoronavirus-remote-learning or: gov.ukguidanceget-laptops-and-tablets-for-children-who-cannot-attend-school-due-to-coronavirus-covid-19This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Here are the steps you need to take in order to navigate the new trading landscape and keep your business movingWhen Jem Skelding started his natural ingredients business Naissance in 2005, it was, he remembers, “just me, a laptop and a phone in a tiny spare room, using my credit card to buy stock”.Sixteen years on, the Neath-based firm has ballooned into a £25m turnover business employing more than 100 people. Trading with the European Union (EU) has buoyed much of that success today, roughly two-thirds of its sales come from the EU. Such is the popularity of its ethically-sourced oils in Europe that when Covid-19 hit Italy in early 2020, Naissance saw increased demand for its aloe vera gel and vegetable glycerine as Italian people started making their own handwashes and sanitisers – at a time when shop stock was low.The Brexit deal announced on Christmas Eve – and implemented on 1 January – means that firms such as Naissance can continue selling to EU customers without paying tariffs. However, the end of the UK transition period on 31 December also meant a number of changes to customs checks and paperwork that British businesses now need to familiarise themselves with. Being unprepared could trigger disruption and increased costs for businesses. As Skelding says: “If the paperwork isn’t correct, it could cause delays – meaning customers may not get their products when they need them.”Skelding’s advice to other SMEs is simple: “Don’t bury your head in the sand. If you’re struggling, there is help out there, such as at gov.uktransition, which has a useful checklist to make sure you’ve ticked all the boxes. There’s light at the end of the tunnel. Whenever there’s substantial change, there are opportunities too.”Find a customs agentAn estimated 250,000 businesses will be making customs declarations for the first time in 2021, which now need to be completed for any goods leaving or entering the UK via the EU. Customs declarations can be complex, so many firms usually appoint a customs agent to do the paperwork for them. You can find a list of approved agents at gov.ukguidancelist-of-customs-agents-and-fast-parcel-operators.Get an EORI numberTo move goods between Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) or the Isle of Man to any country overseas, businesses need an EORI number. Without an EORI, it’ll take HMRC much longer to clear your goods at the border, resulting in unwanted delays and possibly expensive storage costs. To transport goods between Great Britain and the EU, you’ll need an EORI with a “GB” prefix. And your EU partners will need an EORI with an “EU” prefix if they want to receive your goods (make sure you check they have this). Applying takes less than 10 minutes at gov.ukeori.Use government assistanceAfter a tough year when many businesses have undergone economic strain due to Covid-19, assistance is available so companies can adjust to the new processes, such as:Duty defermentPaying customs charges for each inidual consignment imported from the EU is time-consuming. Consider a duty deferment account, which enables firms to pay once a month via direct debit.Postponed accountingIf a business imports goods from the EU, it may need to pay import VAT on them. However, by using postponed accounting, businesses can avoid paying this at UK ports and airports, simply accounting for it on their next VAT return instead.Delayed paymentsFull border controls on goods entering the UK will not apply until 1 July 2021, with border checks staggered into three stages. If you’re not importing goods such as alcohol and tobacco, you can delay payments and defer submitting customs declarations for up to six months.The UK government has a Brexit checker tool, which provides information for businesses on how they can adapt to the new trading landscape at gov.uktransition.This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

It’s time to tackle the problem of discrimination being baked into tech, before it is too lateWant to see a half-naked woman? Well, you’re in luck! The internet is full of pictures of scantily clad women. There are so many of these pictures online, in fact, that artificial intelligence (AI) now seems to assume that women just don’t like wearing clothes.Why was the algorithm so fond of bikini pics? Well, because garbage in means garbage out: the AI “learned” what a typical woman looked like by consuming an online dataset which contained lots of pictures of half-naked women. The study is yet another reminder that AI often comes with baked-in biases. And this is not an academic issue: as algorithms control increasingly large parts of our lives, it is a problem with devastating real-world consequences. Back in 2015, for example, Amazon discovered that the secret AI recruiting tool it was using treated any mention of the word “women’s” as a red flag. Racist facial recognition algorithms have also led to black people being arrested for crimes they didn’t commit. And, last year, an algorithm used to determine students’ A-level and GCSE grades in England seemed to disproportionately downgrade disadvantaged students.As for those image-generation algorithms that reckon women belong in bikinis? They are used in everything from digital job interview platforms to photograph editing. And they are also used to create huge amounts of deepfake porn.

Some children in Wales are expected to return on the same date, while in England and Northern Ireland schools will reopen until 8 March at the earliest.Making her announcement to the Holyrood chamber, the first minister said: “To get the virus more under control, and so that we can prioritise every bit of headroom we create to get children back to school, we must all stay at home except for permitted, essential purposes for a bit longer – at least until the end of this month”.She added that teachers and other school and nursery staff would be offered at-home testing twice a week, along with all senior school pupils, and stressed that the phased return was dependent on the virus continuing to be suppressed.The announcement will put pressure on Downing Street to answer calls from Conservative MPs as to why England is operating on a slower timetable.Tory MP William Wragg, who chairs the constitutional affairs committee said the government should think again. “It’s welcome news to the millions of schoolchildren and their parents that the prime minister has confirmed that schools will be the first to open after lockdown,” he said.“But now that Scotland has indicated that schools are likely to return from 22 February, I’m wondering what’s holding us back from opening them up in England too?”Eight new Conservative MPs, including the former FCO minister Harriett Baldwin and former sports minister Tracey Crouch, have added their support to a call from lobby group UsForThem which demands the government publish a cost-benefit analysis on continued school closures. The demand has now been signed by 28 Tory MPs. Sturgeon also announced that Scotland would introduce a “managed quarantine” policy for people arriving directly into the country, “regardless of which country they have come from”.She added that this was a “much more comprehensive” system than proposed by the government in Westminster – where hotel quarantine will be imposed only on those returning from specific countries – and urged the UK government to adopt a similar approach.She added that there had been five cases of the South African variant in Scotland, all of which were linked to travel, with no evidence of community transmission.She also confirmed that 610,778 Scots had received their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, an increase of 34,881 from Monday’s figure, and said Scotland was on track to vaccinate all over-70s by mid-February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3631dc2562ba9472f6a3525dd47890743b38ade/0_24_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=599f017614d05d517c40b9550967c7cd","title":"decades of progress on extreme poverty now in reverse due to covid","story":"Analysis: The pandemic, combined with the climate crisis and crippling debt burdens, has led to an ‘unprecedented increase’ in poverty, experts warnTwo decades of progress in the reduction of extreme poverty, the elimination of which is one of the sustainable development goals, have been pushed into a sharp reverse by a combination of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the growing climate emergency and increasing debt.With the World Bank warning of a “truly unprecedented increase” in levels of poverty this year, and renewing calls for debt forgiveness, experts are warning of a growing crisis in multiple areas from education to employment, likely to be felt for years to come.While the World Bank was already pessimistic, in January it updated its forecast for the expected number of newly impoverished people this year from between 88 and 115 million to the new range of between 119 and 124 million.But the numbers are forecast to rise in the coming year, and it has not only been in the category of those living below the poverty line of $1.90 (£1.30) a day that increases have been seen. Experts have noted a worrying rise in numbers of people living on less than $3.20 (£2.35) between June last year and January 2021.In recent months the growing crisis has been flagged up in multiple reports looking at indicators from the dropout rate in education in the developing world, to falling wages and rising unemployment, much of it driven by the pandemic, which has closed workplaces, schools and borders, and hammered the global economy.Among those issuing warnings has been the International Labour Organization (ILO), which said global workers lost $3.7tn in earnings during the pandemic.In its annual Global Wage report, issued late last year, the ILO reported that wages had fallen or were growing more slowly across the board in the first six months of 2020 and warned that the Covid-19 crisis was “likely to inflict massive downward pressure on wages in the near future”, with “women and low-paid workers disproportionately affected by the crisis”.The report warned that even in the one-third of countries where average wages appeared to have increased, “this was largely as a result of substantial numbers of lower-paid workers losing their jobs and therefore skewing the average”.But it has been the long-term and less visible effects that are concerning many, not least the impact on education.Among those voicing increasing concern is Axel van Trotsenburg, managing director of operations at the World Bank.“Our concern is that with this crisis we are seeing a reversal in the sustained reduction in extreme poverty and are now witnessing increases. The current estimates are an extra 150 million by the end of this year,” he said.“This is a crisis that has shown just how fragile this progress is, and how much of an effort will be required to rebuild, not least faced with the addition of existing challenges like climate change.“On top of that we are seeing increases in the other poor and unemployed outside of the definition of extreme poverty. It’s a clear sign that this crisis is already producing serious ripple effects.“You have 1 billion kids out of school, and online education not accessible to many children in developing countries. We have done a lot of analysis on this, but just an extra year of school enhances earnings to the degree that if you lose that school year, then the estimate through life, globally, means you are looking at a reduction in world GDP of $10tn.“There is also a disproportionate number of girls who, when they leave school, will permanently quit education so will lose even more.”And while the pandemic has affected countries rich and poor, Van Trotsenburg believes that challenges facing poorer countries are more deep-seated. “One of the major challenges in developing countries is that the majority of employment is in the informal sector.”Andrew Shepherd and his colleagues at the Overseas Development Institute’s Chronic Poverty Advisory Network echo many of the observations of the World Bank and other global organisations.And as Shepherd’s organisation has pointed out, cuts to western aid budgets have further complicated the picture.“These budget cuts leave fewer resources available to tackle the longstanding challenges people have been facing, let alone the immediate struggles of daily subsistence and protection. In this context, the social and economic impacts of Covid-19 will continue to weigh heavily on low- and middle-income countries. And without adequate resources to tackle the overlap of poverty with climate change, conflict, crises of governance and uneven relationships with the global economy, these struggles will only be magnified.”Shepherd points to the risk of new impoverishment in middle-income countries where families have left poverty in recent memory and are vulnerable to sinking back into it.“One of the things that we have been seeing is the impoverishment of new groups who were not impoverished in the normal course of events.”While Shepherd points to the effects of educational dropout during the pandemic as leading to long-term impacts, some of the consequences are less predictable.“We had worked on the hypothesis that this group would be more resilient. And that has not been in the case.“The other big issue is in the urban informal sector in places such as Africa, people like market traders. With lots of markets closing, and the services dependent on them shutting down, that has meant a lot of loss of incomes.”Homi Kharas, a senior fellow for global economy and development at the Brookings Institution, is concerned that for many of the global new poor, the impact of the Covid crisis is likely to last well beyond 2030.In a paper last year, while arguing that some poverty “will be offset as economies start to recover in 2021”, he added that “the longer-term scenario suggests that half of the rise in poverty could be permanent. By 2030, the poverty numbers could still be higher than the baseline by 60 million people.”Speaking in January, Børge Brende, president of the World Economic Forum, highlighted another critical issue.“If we’re going to go into pre-Covid levels of global GDP, we will need to start investing in each other’s countries through foreign direct investment – that has gone down dramatically in the last year and a half.”He added: “We also know that the global value chains and trade are struggling to get back to their pre-Covid levels. And we know that trade has been an engine of growth, and has lifted millions of people out of extreme poverty in the last three decades.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2af68b74306c9906ef5b376318152cbe4dd0cf60/0_21_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=b22194f1788eef100795610ae59db0e3","title":"reverberate episode 2 rick astley versus the dictator of panama podcast","story":"Christmas, 1989: the White House has sent troops to depose Manuel Noriega, but the dictator of Panama has holed up in the Vatican embassy.

Aryan is at home again, which means “loads of sheets of papers to print off” for home schooling, and he says he can’t wait to see his friends again. For 14-year old Becca in Glasgow, the first wave led to her mum being laid off from her job. It meant things were “a little bit harder but we found a way”. She says that if her Mum found it tough looking after her and her three brothers, she didn’t show it. Rory, 18, has just completed his first term at Durham University. He got Covid while he was there and said the experience was very isolating. He says he found returning to Northern Ireland a huge relief.

Last Friday, the EU had what can only be described as a hallucinatory episode when it imagined that vaccine manufacturers were planning to start a major drug racketeering scam by smuggling their jabs across the border from the Republic into Northern Ireland and promptly invoked article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol. If only for a short while, as within hours that decision had been rescinded.“Trust has been eroded,” said Michael Gove, in answer to an urgent question from the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Louise Haigh. It’s quite something when the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has the moral high ground on matters of trust, but it was a measure of just how extreme the EU’s actions had been that no one thought to challenge Gove on his own track record of duplicity. Rather there was a general agreement from MPs of all parties that the EU had been totally out of order to unilaterally invoke article 16 before all other options had been explored.The EU had made a serious mistake, Haigh agreed, and now was the time for calm heads. Peace in Northern Ireland had been hard-won and was too important to be used as a political football. Several MPs who had been using Northern Ireland as a political football for years nodded their heads in agreement: the protocol must never again be undermined in this way.This was Gove slightly out of his element. Normally there’s nothing he likes more than telling people – usually with confected, passive-aggressive sincerity – how right they are to be on the same side of the argument as himself. Especially when they aren’t. But now he found himself obliged to be somewhat more genuine, as time and again he found himself praising MPs – both Europhiles and Eurosceptics – for their wisdom and foresight in seeing things from his point of view, while expressing his own regrets at the threats made against border control officers in Larne and Belfast.In the end, all this honest agreement rather got to Gove and he wound up saying rather more than he intended. Boris Johnson has always maintained that any difficulties with the movement of goods between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK had only ever been teething problems but Gove suggested the problems were rather more intrinsic and there were issues that had been overlooked in everyone’s haste to get a deal signed off in such a short time frame.Gove even indicated that some grace periods would need to be extended: something the Northern Ireland minister, Brandon Lewis, had previously said was unthinkable. All of this was soluble, he insisted. Just leave it with him and his EU counterpart, Maroš Šefčovič, to work out. That didn’t sound wholly convincing – the EU triggering article 16 less than a month after the end of the transition period didn’t bode well for the future of the protocol – but no one had any better ideas so Gove was by and large left unchallenged.As was Matt Hancock who came to the chamber to give a coronavirus update that was pretty much a repeat of the No 10 press conference he had given the day before. I guess he wanted to make the most of 2 February being Groundhog Day. The vaccination programme was on schedule with 9.2 million jabs having been administered and urgent action was being taken to track down the contacts of the 11 cases of the South African variant that had been passed on through community transmission.Not that the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, and others didn’t try to pin Hancock down on matters of detail. Such as whether Sage had recommended a more aggressive hotel quarantine policy and when the South African variant was first identified. Rather it felt as if no one was in the mood for political point scoring right now as if even most MPs needed a break from reminding the government of how its mishandling of the pandemic over the past year had caused so many, many unnecessary deaths.Maybe also there was a touch of fear in the chamber. That Covid-19 was a trickier disease than had been first thought and the vaccine might not be the get-out-of-jail card everyone hoped. These anxieties were largely kept contained though and there was more the sense that everyone was waiting for something to happen. Only they didn’t quite know what that something was. Then nobody does. Not even Hancock. Especially Matt Hancock."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b002e6fcae31dc0df06a77cd91ab504bdfd73bf2/0_76_4337_2601/master/4337.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e062793305b18ba18fb6d2166ba43e4a","title":"women criticise release private messages about alex salmond inquiry","story":"Group hit out at Crown Office and MSPs after discussions of sexual assault allegations are handed to Scottish parliamentA group of women who discussed allegations of sexual assault by Alex Salmond have attacked the Crown Office and MSPs after their private messages about the case were released to the Scottish parliament.The women, understood to be Scottish National party figures, said releasing the texts could have “grave consequences” for future victims of alleged sexual violence if people feared their private correspondence could be disclosed.The messages were released last Friday to MSPs looking into the Scottish government’s botched investigation into claims Salmond had sexually harassed two officials after Holyrood issued an unprecedented legal order demanding they were disclosed.In a statement released by Rape Crisis Scotland, the small group of women said they were “deeply disappointed” the committee had asked for the messages, and questioned the conduct of some MSPs.“We have no doubt that members of the committee knew that vulnerable witnesses were involved when they made the request,” they said.“We are also deeply disturbed that the crown has felt it appropriate to break the trust we placed in it. Having been let down by the Crown Office, we feel this unnecessary act will have done serious damage to progress made over the last few years in sexual assault cases.“We urge the crown to consider the grave consequences of their actions, and are actively considering further options.”The committee’s convener, Linda Fabiani, made it clear there were no plans to publish the messages. She said: “These communications included numerous chains of private messages between different women in what we are clear were safe spaces … We will not publish any of these messages as we are clear that we will not do anything that may cause further unnecessary distress to any women.”Salmond was tried in March 2020 on 14 charges of sexual assault, including one of attempted rape, but acquitted of every charge after a jury trial at the high court in Edinburgh.He acknowledged having a “sleepy cuddle” with one complainant, and confirmed he apologised to her soon afterwards. He also said he had a consensual sexual encounter with another woman who accused him of attempted rape, but on a different day months earlier.Salmond has alleged that SNP officials and people close to Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, were involved in a conspiracy to bolster the police investigation and had pushed complainants into giving evidence – an allegation Sturgeon has repeatedly denied.A Holyrood source said the nine MSPs on the committee had unanimously agreed on Tuesday morning that the messages were private and would not be used in their investigation. They agreed, however, to press the Crown Office further, to ensure any relevant material is released to the committee.Sandy Brindley, the chief executive of Rape Crisis Scotland, said: “I have read the messages: there’s nothing in them which is relevant to the committee remit or anything which is suggestive of a conspiracy. They show women supporting each other through a very difficult time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9152a314a77a30ada3fa6d6094b9b148b71c04ad/0_94_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2034e0e42418a36e5ae63f19ee210076","title":"what we can learn from british history about unemployment","story":"Scarring left by the job losses of the early 1980s is still the reference point for today’s politiciansTucked away in the National Archives is the Treasury’s copy of the Liberal party’s manifesto for the 1929 election. Ostensibly written by David Lloyd George but influenced by John Maynard Keynes, the pamphlet – “We can conquer unemployment” – urges higher government borrowing to shorten Britain’s dole queues. Underneath an image of the former prime minister, an official has scrawled a three-word response: extravagance inflation bankruptcy.Some things don’t change. Unemployment has been central to politics and culture for the best part of a century. DH Lawrence and Alan Bleasdale in Boys from the Blackstuff both wrote about the plight of Britain’s industrial working class. From Winston Churchill in the 1920s to Rishi Sunak, chancellors have been given advice on how to create jobs.What’s more, the Treasury still frets about the cost, which is why almost every public statement from the chancellor says action will eventually be needed to bring down a budget deficit on course to reach £400bn this year. Up until now, though, the government has been spending and borrowing to prevent firms forcibly shut by lockdown restrictions from going bust and axing jobs.The furlough – and other business support – has not prevented unemployment from rising by about 1 million, but intervention by the state has prevented much worse damage. For the past year, the Treasury’s wage subsidies have stood between Britain and mass unemployment.Andy Haldane, the chief economist at the Bank of England, says that without state support, unemployment might already have reached 5 million. Treasury officials from the late 1920s could well be turning in their graves, but no government these days would try to balance the books when faced with a deep recession. As the free-market economist Robert Lucas once noted: “In a foxhole we are all Keynesians.”Keynes eventually won his battle with the mandarins but it took 15 years – and the second world war – to enshrine the political commitment to full employment. A generation of politicians – including Harold Wilson and Ted Heath – never forgot what it was like growing up during the interwar years.Post-war baby boomers came of age when jobs were easy to come by. If it’s hard to find a mention of unemployment in the songs of the Beatles or the Rolling Stones during their 1960s heyday, that’s because it was not an issue.But by 1981 it was possible to sense how much had changed simply by listening to the music on the radio: Ghost Town by the Specials or One in Ten by UB40, a band named after the form that unemployment claimants had to complete to get benefits. On the other side of the Atlantic, Bruce Springsteen was lamenting the end of the American Dream as factories closed all over the “Rust Belt”.The contrast between the late 1960s and the early 1980s was marked. Heath flirted briefly with what became known as monetarism but when unemployment hit what was then considered to be the politically unacceptable level of one million, he did an immediate U-turn and reflated the economy. Responding to mid-1970s stagflation – a combination of sluggish growth and high inflation – Labour’s James Callaghan abandoned Keynesian economics.This was just the prelude to a more radical approach. In 1980, Margaret Thatcher was determined to defeat inflation no matter what it took. Faced with pressure to ease up as the economy suffered, she famously said: “You turn if you want to. The lady’s not for turning.”Her speech to the Conservative party conference in 1980 came in the year that unemployment hit two million. Despite repeated massaging of the official figures, it carried on rising to three million and stayed there until the middle of the decade. And Thatcher’s determination to stick to her hardline monetarist convictions came at a cost: not just the riots in Brixton and Toxteth but longer-term damage as older workers were hidden away on sickness and disability benefits. Unemployment permeated into communities, creating a deep well of resentment that has never drained away.The scarring left by the job losses of the early 1980s remains the reference point for today’s politicians, even though unemployment again hit 3 million in the recession that followed the collapse of the late 1980s boom, and surged again during the financial crash of 2008-09."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c996b9ec9969e373532b4c3605e0e9ef2eecb0c/0_316_3340_2003/master/3340.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=383c30f66f23a52663e72f4339cb0a7d","title":"travel photographer of the year 2020 in pictures","story":"From majestic landscapes, intimate animal portraits and intriguing night-time views beneath the ocean’s surface, to glimpses of cultures across the world, the winning images from Travel Photographer of the Year 2020 present a view of life on our planet at a time in which travel has been difficult or impossible The winning images will go on display in Coal Drops Yard, King’s Cross, London, in May and in other TPOTY exhibitions, including Chester Cathedral, during 2021"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9aaae10b51c01f689ed6269c51845d3e0acd0d90/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=b4210fde87c7f47e214333036eeb1214","title":"pete buttigieg confirmed transportation secretary","story":"Pete Buttigieg won Senate approval on Tuesday as transportation secretary, the first out gay person to be confirmed to a cabinet post. He will be tasked with advancing Joe Biden’s ambitious agenda of rebuilding the nation’s infrastructure and fighting climate change.Buttigieg, a 39-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and Biden’s one-time rival during the Democratic presidential primaries, was approved on an 86-13 vote.“I’m honored and humbled by today’s vote in the Senate and ready to get to work,” Buttigieg tweeted shortly after he was confirmed.Praised by Biden for bringing a “new voice” to the administration, Buttigieg takes over a transportation department with 55,000 employees and a budget of tens of billions of dollars.He has pledged to quickly get to work promoting safety and restoring consumer trust in America’s transportation networks as airlines, buses, city subway systems and Amtrak reel from plummeting ridership in the coronavirus pandemic.Buttigieg brings ersity to the cabinet. Under Donald Trump, Richard Grenell served as acting director of national intelligence and is gay, but he did not have to face Senate confirmation as an acting director. Buttigieg is expected to play an important role in promoting Biden’s sweeping green initiatives, helping to oversee stronger automotive fuel economy standards to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support the president’s push later this year for a $2tn climate and infrastructure plan. That plan will be focused on rebuilding roads and bridges and expanding zero-emission mass transit while boosting electric vehicle infrastructure, including building 500,000 charging stations over the next decade.Biden hasn’t indicated how he intends to pay for an infrastructure plan, coming on top of the administration’s proposed $1.9tn virus relief plan that has met some headwinds in Congress. Buttigieg’s suggestion during his hearing that a gas tax hike might be needed was immediately walked back by his spokesman.The Afghanistan war veteran burst on to the national scene in 2019 after launching a longshot presidential bid, introducing himself to voters as “Mayor Pete” and drawing initial skepticism due to his youth and limited government experience. He outperformed expectations after zeroing in on a message of generational change, finishing the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses in a virtual tie with Bernie Sanders.But Buttigieg struggled to appeal to Black voters and dropped out of the race after a crushing loss to Biden in the South Carolina primary. Buttigieg chose to quickly endorse Biden, helping him solidify centrist support against Sanders’ strong liberal challenge.“Congratulations to Secretary Pete Buttigieg on his historic confirmation,” Alphonso David, president of Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group, said after the vote. “This confirmation breaks through a barrier that has existed for too long, where LGBTQ identity served as an impediment to nomination or confirmation at the highest level of government.”Later in the day, the Senate confirmed Alejandro Mayorkas to head the Department of Homeland Security, making him the first Latino and immigrant to hold the position, and further solidifying Biden’s cabinet.The Senate approved Mayorkas despite strong opposition from Republicans and he was given the tightest confirmation vote so far, 57 for to 42 votes against.As secretary of the sprawling agency, Mayorkas will oversee a 240,000-employee department responsible for border security, immigration enforcement, cybersecurity and disaster readiness and relief, among other missions.Mayorkas, 61, will also stand at the center of Biden’s attempts to reverse many immigration restrictions initiated by Donald Trump.NPNA, the National Partnership for New Americans, which represents the nation’s largest immigrant coalitions, put out a celebratory tweet congratulating Majorkas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51955527cfaf9aed4c85f8f70f50152bda995378/118_0_1777_1066/master/1777.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99098da11775381d24f3b09da26a69f4","title":"lost on the frontline covid nurse coronavirus","story":"Yolanda Coar was 40 when she died of Covid-19 in August 2020 in Augusta, Georgia.

The tiny settlement of about 100 inhabitants had been prioritised because of its older population, many of whom belong to the White River First Nation.Onboard were the casino executive Rod Baker and his wife, the actor Ekaterina Baker, who had broken quarantine and flown to Beaver Creek for the sole purpose of receiving doses of the Moderna vaccine.Over the next few hours, the couple travelled into town, posed as local motel employees, received their shots and then escaped as quickly as they had arrived.As Canada struggles with vaccine shortages and delays, the Bakers’ deception has been met with scorn and disbelief. The incident – in which a wealthy white couple received treatment intended for the most vulnerable members of an Indigenous community – has cast a spotlight on the stark isions of class and race that cut across the country.“They saw the most vulnerable people within the community on full display and continued on to get the shot,” said Janet Vander Meer of the White River First Nation. “That’s what disgusts me.”When their chartered plane touched down in Beaver Creek, the Bakers told airport staff they were heading north to Dawson City, but had been forced by fog to land. They would wait in Beaver Creek until the weather improved, they said.While the pilot waited, the couple caught a ride towards the town’s main drag: a handful of hotels, gas stations and a tourist information centre, hemmed in by black spruce trees and rolling boreal forest.“It’s really been a bit of a ghost town. And so vaccination day was meant to be a small glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel for people,” said Vander Meer, who worked with territorial officials to help set up the vaccination event. “The clinic and the vaccine coming was a reason for us to celebrate.”Since early January, the Yukon government has used two mobile vaccination teams to target vulnerable and hard-to-reach areas such as Beaver Creek. The teams – Balto and Togo – are named after two famous sled dogs, in a nod to the region’s harsh conditions.It is unclear how the Bakers knew about the team’s visit to Beaver Creek – nearly 3,000km (1,900 miles) from their luxury condominium in downtown Vancouver, British Columbia.As head of Great Canadian Gaming Corporation, which runs racetracks and casinos across the country, Rod Baker made a profit of C$45.9m ($35.7m) in stock options exercised over the past 13 months, according to the Globe and Mail. He resigned from his role after he was charged by Yukon officials. Ekaterina has appeared in a number of films, including Chick Fight and Fatman.After Bakers allegedly asked for a ride to the airport, members of the vaccine team grew suspicious. Calls to local motels confirmed that neither were employees. The team then contacted Yukon’s law enforcement officials.In Beaver Creek, where residents found out about the couple’s ploy from local reporters, not the government, the immediate response was one of panic: thanks to its isolation, the community had not seen any confirmed cases of the virus, but age and pre-existing health conditions meant that its population was firmly in the demographic most vulnerable to Covid-19.“I have never seen anybody charter flights to Beaver Creek,” said Quanah Giuseppe Vander Meer, another member of White River First Nation. “I’ve lived there most of my life and it scared me hearing about them being able to sneak in like that.”Janet Vander Meer, who had spent months working out the logistics of the vaccine delivery, went home and cried.“I felt as if I had let my community down,” she said. “The mental toll that these people put on me and my family, making me feel like I did something wrong – that’s not acceptable. It’s something l’m still grappling with.”Janet Vander Meeer is still furious to think that before receiving their own vaccinations, the Bakers would have seen both her mother – who is in palliative care and moves with a walker – as well as an 88-year-old Beaver Creek resident waiting in line for the vaccine.“You’d think at that point, one of them would say ‘OK, honey, let’s get back to our chartered plane.’ But no – they got their shot,” she said.News of the Bakers’ trip reached the wider world when local papers reported that the couple had been fined for breaching lockdown rules. And when the size of the fine – C$2,300 ($1,800) – was compared with the couple’s wealth, the outrage only grew.“There is nothing more un-Canadian than going to another jurisdiction to jump the line because you have the means to do so,” the British Columbia premier, John Horgan, told reporters.Last week, Yukon officials announced the tickets had been stayed and the Bakers were summoned to appear in court, where they will face charges for failing to self-isolate for 14 days and failing to act in a manner consistent with their declarations upon arriving in the Yukon. If convicted, they could face up to six months in jail. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police are also investigating. The Bakers have not commented publicly since the charges were filed.Alongside indignation over the Bakers’ behaviour, the saga has highlighted the deeply rooted racial inequities of Canada’s healthcare system: many remote Indigenous communities lack sufficient resources to care for residents and are especially vulnerable to outside infection during the pandemic.“We know that this is a system that has failed Indigenous peoples … and treated Indigenous peoples as second-class citizens,” said Marc Miller, Indigenous services minister, to a conference on racism in the healthcare system last week.Janet Vander Meer said her efforts remained fixed on White River’s safety – and ensuring nothing like this happened again.“I don’t care what they were doing or thinking when they came up here. I don’t have time for that,” she said. “Right now, I need to focus on getting the community ready to get the second dose of the vaccine safely. Because that’s what matters most.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15791c0e062f651b573341e3e412b07b41cd59c1/0_0_4684_2809/master/4684.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d32b79c901f747bb9585bdc1eaf6900","title":"denmarks former immigration minister to face impeachment trial","story":"Parliament votes to try Inger Støjberg over 2016 order aimed at separating asylum-seeking couplesDenmark’s parliament has overwhelmingly voted to try a former immigration minister at the rarely used court of impeachment over a 2016 order aimed at separating asylum-seeking couples where one partner is under 18.The 179-member Folketing voted 139-30 to try Inger Støjberg, who served in the previous government from June 2015 to 2019. The court will convene for the first time in 26 years.She has been charged with illegally initiating the separation of cohabiting couples where one partner was a minor while being in the care of the Danish asylum system. She also misled parliamentary committees on four separate occasions when informing them of her decision.Støjberg could face an unspecified fine or a maximum two years in prison. No date for a trial was announced.A parliament-appointed commission had said earlier that separating couples in asylum centres was “clearly illegal” and that Støjberg had received warnings from her department that the practice was unlawful.The court, which adjudicates cases in which government ministers are accused of unlawful misconduct and misuse of office, was last convened in 1995. Created in 1849, five cases have been brought before the court, which consists of 15 supreme court judges and 15 members appointed by the Danish parliament. Only two ministers have been found guilty in the court’s history.Støjberg, who was considered an immigration hardliner, said while in office that 32 couples were to be separated, but only 23 of them were split up before the policy was halted months later. She cannot appeal against a court ruling.Støjberg had spearheaded the tightening of asylum and immigration rules, and Denmark adopted a law in 2016 requiring newly arrived asylum-seekers to hand over valuables such as jewellery and gold to help pay for their stays in the country.Danish media noted that most of the women among the separated couples were between the ages of 15 and 17 and the men were between 15 and 32. Most came from Syria and some couples had children or the women were pregnant.In Denmark the legal age of marriage is 18. The women who were under 18 said they had consented to their marriage.In 1995, the former justice minister Erik Ninn-Hansen received a suspended four-month sentence for preventing Sri Lankan refugees from bringing their families to Denmark.Immigration has become a less pressing issue in Danish politics since the Social Democrats took power in the 2019 election."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d24e33a2fa8ecc1bae4d115019772c7a26d67375/0_346_3330_1998/master/3330.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=53689f18edfb0b0af2ecd895edb84a43","title":"italian president sergio mattarella to seek a high profile government","story":"Media speculations suggest former European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi could become prime ministerItaly’s president, Sergio Mattarella, has said he would seek a “high profile” government, as speculation grew that it may be led by the former European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi.Mattarella made the announcement after ruling coalition partners failed to form a majority following Giuseppe Conte’s resignation as prime minister last week.Mattarella said he was left with two choices: either call snap elections or nominate a technical government (one consisting of appointed technocrats rather than elected representatives) to manage the coronavirus pandemic and the country’s economic and social challenges.He did not say who he would pick to lead the government, but Draghi – nicknamed “Super Mario” for his role in saving the euro – has been summoned to meet Mattarella on Wednesday. The move follows days of speculation in the Italian press about Draghi’s possible appointment as a technical prime minister.Lower house speaker Roberto Fico, a politician from the Five Star Movement (M5S) who was tasked with exploring the possibility of rebuilding the coalition with Conte leading it, told reporters earlier on Tuesday night that “there remain differences”.The crisis was triggered when former prime minister Matteo Renzi withdrew his small Italia Viva party from the ruling majority in January due to clashes over the government’s handling of the pandemic and post-Covid economic recovery plan.Conte survived two confidence votes in both houses of parliament in January but not by enough to secure a majority.Conte, a law professor, was plucked out of nowhere to lead his first government, a coalition between M5S and Matteo Salvini’s far-right League, in June 2018. That partnership collapsed in August 2019, paving the way for his second government.The M5S-PD alliance was essentially orchestrated by Renzi, then a member of the Democratic party, in order to stave off elections that could have seen the far right seize power. Within weeks of the government being sworn in, Renzi formed Italia Viva while promising to support the ruling majority.Renzi’s main point of contention was Italy’s plans for spending the €200bn-plus it is due to receive from the European recovery fund.The political crisis comes in the midst of the pandemic, which has claimed almost 90,000 lives in Italy, and as the country struggles with its worst recession since the second world war."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf9d70e332e0f42eae05df23f8fe2aaf1ebc66ac/0_85_5510_3305/master/5510.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=287b8a186c78b62c1057f1ee8cb4aab8","title":"majority in england turned down for self isolation support data shows","story":"Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, which carried out the research, said the “patchy” and “paltry” approach to reimbursing people’s lost earnings was forcing people to choose between “doing the right thing and being plunged into hardship”.“Too many low-paid workers are going without the financial support they need to self-isolate – this is a gaping hole in the UK’s public health approach,” she added.Financial support for people who need to self-isolate is critical to the government’s coronavirus strategy because the disease will continue to spread unless infectious people and their close contacts go into quarantine for 10 days.The test-and-trace support payment scheme was introduced only four months ago to support low-paid workers who will lose earnings if they cannot leave home. However, the strict eligibility criteria means that only one in eight workers qualify for the £500 payment if ordered to self-isolate, according to the Resolution Foundation.Only those on a low income who cannot work from home and receive one of seven means-tested benefits are eligible for the main support payment, excluding many small business owners, sole traders, self-employed workers and parents whose children have been told to self-isolate. revealed last month that a government review had concluded that the scheme excluded too many people and was too complex to administer. Ministers are considering dramatically expanding the £500 payment, although a universal lump sum to everyone who tests positive is said to have been dismissed by the Treasury after being proposed by Matt Hancock’s Department of Health and Social Care.The TUC said there was a £20.2m shortfall between the amount councils need and what the government has provided. It said this would grow to £70.6m if the same demand is replicated across England.The UK has the lowest mandatory sick pay for Covid-19 sufferers in the OECD as a proportion of the average worker’s earnings, at just £95.85 a week. The Treasury has repeatedly dismissed the TUC’s calls to increase statutory sick pay to £330 a week and extend it to all workers.A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said the report “paints an incomplete picture” of the “targeted scheme” and that it was working with councils to monitor its effectiveness.She added: “Since the outset the government has covered the cost of administering the scheme and has provided local authorities with more funding to make discretionary payments to anyone outside the scope of the scheme who is facing financial hardship because of self-isolation.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4474533.1612301505!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"teachers unions oppose hybrid leaving cert proposal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTeachers’ unions have expressed their strong opposition to students being given a choice between exams and calculated grades in talks with the Department of Education. Photograph: Nick BradshawTeachers’ unions have expressed their strong opposition to students being given a choice between exams and calculated grades in talks with the Department of Education.An advisory group of education stakeholders held a meeting on Tuesday afternoon to discuss planning for the State exams which was attended by Minister for Education Norma Foley.Sources said a number of options for assessing students were presented at the meeting.They include delaying Leaving Cert exams until later in the summer giving students calculated grades instead of exams an “open access” model with additional college places and versions of a “hybrid” model combining exams and calculated grades.Politically, the latter option is seen by some Government Ministers as the most attractive on the basis that it has support from both student and parents’ groups, as well as Opposition political parties.However, such a move would require the co-operation of unions, which have called for exams to go ahead.The Teachers’ Union of Ireland and the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland both want modified exams with greater choice to proceed.Sources say teachers’ representatives voiced major concerns at the advisory group meeting over the feasibility of any proposal which combines calculated grades and exams.A key concern among teachers is that this would oblige them to rank their students in order across each subject. This proved controversial last year on the basis that students were able to access this information after they received their results.Other issues raised by teachers include the reduced amount of coursework available on which to base calculated grades, along with challenges in teaching students who opt for calculated grades or exams.Students, on the other hand, insist that a choice between exams and calculated grades is the fairest and most equitable solution.Reuban Murray, president of the Irish Second Level Students’ Union, said Leaving Cert students were under huge strain and a “compassionate” response was urgently needed.Clarity“We need to work within the parameters of choice being given to students . . . We need to move to a point where we give students clarity and certainty.”In a statement, a spokesman for the Department of Education confirmed that the advisory group on the exams explored a number of options for the Leaving Cert, “which sought to take account of the impact of school closures on allowing the examinations to be run in as close a manner as in a normal year”.A further meeting of the subgroup is planned for later this week.Sources said it is likely that firm proposals will be put before the Cabinet next Tuesday for consideration.Separately, there are growing hopes that a phased reopening of all schools could see all pupils back in school by mid-March.Special education is due to partially reopen to thousands of children from February 11th following agreement with school staff unions, while special classes in mainstream primary schools are due to reopen from February 22nd.Sources involved in discussions said they believe primary schools will be in a position to reopen fully from early March.Similarly, sources are optimistic that secondary schools will also begin to reopen on a phased basis from late February.It is likely students with additional needs will be prioritised alongside exam year groups – such as Leaving Certs – followed by the remainder of secondary students."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"New appointments to Climate Change Advisory Council coinciding with enhanced roleMove will end fossil fuel prospecting and the future development of oil and gas fields\u0026lsquoDo you imagine not paying for your mobile phone or electricity?\u0026rsquo Lo\u0026iumlc Fauchon asks"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Government and its agencies finally taking threats of storms seriously"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4474601.1612337580!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland in line to get 4 47m covid 19 vaccine doses by end of june","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“Vaccine Hunters”: People  wait in line for hours for a chance to get vaccinated against Covid-19 outside the Kedren Community Health Center in Los Angeles, California, on Tuesday. Photograph: Etienne LaurentEPANearly half of the population of Ireland could be in line to receive a Covid-19 vaccine by the end of June, according to a new European delivery schedule.Under the plan, the Republic of Ireland would be in line to receive around 4.47 million doses by the end of June, reflecting its population of about 1.1 per cent of the overall EU.The European Commission (EC) expects 33 million doses of overall Covid-19 vaccines to be delivered this month, 55 million doses in March, and 300 million between April and June.In all, 18.5 million doses of vaccines were delivered in January and shared among the 27 member states, 17.6 million of them Pfizer-BioNTech doses and the remainder made by Moderna, according to EC figures.All are made available to member states depending on population size, meaning that if Ireland opts to take all of its available doses it would be in line to have received about 4.47 million doses by the end of June.The number of people who can be vaccinated by the deliveries depends on how many of the doses are of two-shot vaccines, and how many are of the single-shot vaccine currently under development by Johnson \u0026amp Johnson.So far, only Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca have applied for and received authorisation from the European Medicines Agency. Johnson \u0026amp Johnson has indicated it hopes to be in a position to apply for approval this month.DeathsA further 101 deaths of Covid-19 patients were reported by the National Public Health Emergency Team on Tuesday, the highest daily figure reported during the pandemic. The deaths included that of a 19-year-old, one of the youngest victims of Covid-19. There have now been 3,418 Covid-19 deaths in total in the Republic.The figures come as clarity is awaited over the precise role AstraZeneca will play in the Irish vaccination programme. The National Immunisation Advisory Council (NIAC) wrote to the chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan on Monday with its advice on the shot.It is thought it advised that while the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe and effective to use and is an option for the over-70s, mRNA-based vaccines such as Moderna and Pfizer should be given to older cohorts whenever it is practical and timely. Sources said the advice is that AstraZeneca should be given if others are not available, with the most important factor being that people are vaccinated in some form.A growing number of European countries have recommended limiting use of the AstraZeneca jab in older people, including Germany, Poland, Italy, Sweden and France. The trials for the AstraZeneca shot included a relatively small number of over 55s, although it has been approved for use in all adults by the EMA.QuarantineMeanwhile mandatory hotel quarantine for incoming travellers without a negative Covid test or from Brazil and South Africa, announced by the Government last week, is “a matter of weeks” away, ministers were told yesterday.The Cabinet has been told that legislation must be passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas before travellers from certain countries, such as Brazil and South Africa, can be required by law to spend 14 days in a hotel, a process that the Government hopes to have concluded within weeks.The move was announced last week by the Taoiseach Micheál Martin as part of the extension of the lockdown and the tightening of pandemic restrictions.

He said he had dealt with the assistant secretary in the Department of Public Expenditure with responsibility for public service pay as well as the secretary general to the Department of the Taoiseach about the remuneration to apply . He also said he had consulted with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance on the issue.He said the Taoiseach had said there would be an enhanced package put in place for the substantive role following the competition. He said Mr Maritn had not set out the specific salary level to apply. Mr McGrath told the committee that in deciding on the new salary level he had taken into account a number of factors.“It is no secret that the post of secretary general in the Department of Health is a highly complex one with a very challenging brief, especially in the midst of a global pandemic. There are very significant responsibilities attached to this role including: the ongoing management of the response to the Covid public health emergency implementing the Government’s ambition to deliver on Sláintecare and the management of the greatly increased budget of €22 billion for Health in 2021.”The Minister said there was a need for an enhanced salary to attract the very best candidates from around the world.He said there was a reality that the State had faced challenges in filling leadership posts in the health service. He said the position of chief executive of the HSE had had to be advertised twice.The Minister accepted that the new higher pay rate could lead to knock-on claims but suggested any such demands would be resisted.He said he was not sure this would be as big a problem as some people believed.Plucked out of airMr McGrath faced strong criticism from members of the committee about the proposed pay level.Pearse Doherty of Sinn Féin said there was no indication of how the Government had decided on the €292,000 rate.He said it seemed to have been “plucked out of the air”.Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín said people’s jaws dropped when they saw the salary. He said the director general of the World Health Organisation was paid less than €200,000.Solidarity TD Mick Barry said the proposed increase in pay for the post was “outrageous”.

mummies, including some with gold tongues in their mouths, according to the country’s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities. The Egyptian-Dominican team from the University of Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic was working at the Taposiris Magna Temple in western Alexandria when it discovered the remains of 16 ancient Egyptians buried in rock tombs.The mummies were poorly preserved and in a state of significant decomposition, but photographs released by the ministry showed a human skeleton with a clearly visible, tongue-shaped piece of gold placed in its jaw. According to officials, the amulets “were placed in the mouth of the mummy in a special ritual to ensure their ability to speak in the afterlife before the Osirian court.” In Egyptian mythology, Osiris was the god of the afterlife, as well as fertility and agriculture.Dr Kathleen Martinez, who headed the team, explained that of the 16 mummies, the two most important had preserved alongside them the remains of scrolls and parts of their cartonnage – a kind papyrus or linen-based papier-mache used to construct the intricate “face masks” that envelop the mummified bodies inside their sarcophagi.The falcon-headed Horus was the god of kingship and the skyAlongside the golden tongues, the gilded cartonnage and the mummies’ location in rock-cut tombs suggested the mummies dated to the era of Greek and Roman rule, the ministry said in its statement.While the tongue amulets might have been the most striking element of the find, Dr Khaled Abo El Hamd, director-general of the Alexandria Antiquities, was cited as saying that the most important discoveries of this archaeological season were: “a funeral mask for a woman, eight golden flakes representing the leaves of a golden wreath, and eight masks of marble dating back to the Greek and Roman eras”. The Taposiris Magna Temple is thought to have been constructed by Ptolemy IV, who ruled Egypt from 221 to 204 BC, while coins bearing the image of Cleopatra VII have previously been found at the site.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you

which heroism has sprung from many places, and in many guises, Captain Sir Tom Moore’s extraordinary contribution struck a unique chord with the British public.Within the space of a few months, he has become a symbol of steadfast endurance, a household name, a bona fide national treasure.He drummed up more than £33 million in donations for the NHS, which was an unprecedented amount. But that alone does not explain the remarkable way in which he captured the public’s imagination.Captain Sir Tom’s original aim was to raise a modest £1,000 by completing 100 laps, each a 25-metre loop, of his garden in Marston Moretaine, Bedfordshire, before his 100th birthday last April.He used a walking frame, campaign medals catching the light as he purposefully, effortfully, put one foot in front of the other, day after day. And soon the eyes of a locked-down nation were looking on, mesmerised and moved by his unshowy display of resolve.Amid the battle metaphors, it seemed fitting that a Second World War veteran should command such admiration for stepping up – especially after triumphing over skin cancer and a broken hip.At a time when the old were being advised to stay indoors and depicted as fragile, it was surely chastening for the young to witness Captain Sir Tom, a man of 99, showing such grit and mental toughness.Above all, it was a reminder that vulnerability to a virus does not equate to weakness, and age is no bar to strength of character or generosity of spirit.Almost a year into this wretched pandemic, we literally owe our lives to countless unnamed medics, nurses and healthcare workers battling against Covid-19 on the frontline. And so we clapped them, commended them, acknowledged their sacrifice and saluted their collective professionalism.By contrast, our debt to this doughty, determined centenarian who walked his way into the record books was peculiarly personal.We felt we knew him. And as his life took a turn for the surreal, we cheered on every achievement.He received a knighthood from the Queen and was made an honorary colonel. His autobiography, Tomorrow Will Be A Good Day, proved to be a bestseller and, such was his cultural reach, for children there was a picture book called One Hundred Steps.He topped the singles chart with a cover version of You’ll Never Walk Alone, recorded with Michael Ball, and was given the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Helen Rollason Award in 2020.But even more touching were the gloriously idiosyncratic inidual tributes. In Tunbridge Wells, an elaborate knitted tribute to him appeared on a postbox. A 24-foot mural was painted in Southport. An estimated 150,000 people sent him birthday cards.In truth, our affection for Captain Sir Tom was due in no small part to a belief he was standing up for Britain.He was the embodiment of the country pulling together, each of us doing our bit to defeat the unseen enemy, however challenging the circumstances.A grandfather-of-four, Captain Sir Tom had moved in with one of his two daughters and her family in 2008 after his beloved wife, Pamela, died from dementia.  Just under a year ago, when the country went into the first lockdown, he was adamant he wanted to give back to the NHS that had treated him.And so began an endeavour that far exceeded anyone’s wildest dreams.It was a joy to watch him revel in the limelight, whether interviewed on television or gamely posing on the cover of GQ magazine in full black tie and limited-edition Omega watch, like the original James Bond.His fame went global and the big-budget movie rights to his tremendously filmic life story were swiftly snapped up.When asked who should play him, Captain Sir Tom quipped that Sir Michael Caine or Sir Anthony Hopkins, respectively aged 87 and 82, would be ideal, providing they were “prepared to age-up”.Captain Sir Tom Moore’s astonishing legacy will live on long after him. He was an unlikely hero determined to make a difference without fanfare. He was dutiful and dignified.He was the very best of us.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"learned summers lifeguard ever would have city internships","story":"My tutor was ritually unimpressed. Each autumn I would return to university sporting a shamefully robust tan. It was a blazing confession: I had not spent my summer working diligently in a lofty City firm, accumulating an impressive CV. I had spent it on the beach.Ok, I was far from idling. I was employed as a surf-lifeguard, but I still felt a bit guilty. It seemed almost obscene that my office was the beach, and my duties were not coffee rounds and photocopying, but things I loved – swimming, surfing and keeping fit.There were the less edifying moments: men of a certain age who imagined themselves to be the first ever to ask if I would give them the kiss of life if they drowned the 10-year-old boys whose evolving flirtation techniques involved decanting fishing maggots into your lunch box.There were howling rainy days, sometimes a summer of them, when I would lodge myself into a rock crevice, curl up inside my man-sized red and yellow anorak, watch the tide advance and retreat, and count the few bathers braving the roaring grey sea.Then there were the perfect days. After work we would all go for a surf until the sunset turned the waves pink, or drink beers on the surf-club balcony.It was not until a few years later that I realised that my time as a lifeguard was not only the best way to spend a summer, but also the best possible preparation for my future, especially for my job as an MP.If you are working on a beach with a dangerous, fast-moving tide, time is of the essence. Breaching a deadline could mean somebody actually dies. Clever PR will not rescue that injured surfer from a rock before the tide comes in – only coordinated action, organisation, courage and expertise will do that.A lifeguard understands the importance and limits of rules. They learn when to persuade and when to police: whether that is for people to stay between the two red and yellow flags (the safest bathing area) or the macho chap attempting to swim on a dangerous red-flagged (closed) beach, because he is convinced “he is a strong swimmer”.A lifeguard learns how to manage people’s panic and trauma – whether that is eliciting the necessary information from the distraught mother who has lost her toddler or directing the traumatised crowd who have gathered round the cliff-fall victim.Last year, we saw how essential lifeguards are to our public safety. Like many organisations, the RNLI was unprepared for the effects of Covid, and for a time many of our beaches did not have their usual lifeguard cover. During that time, we saw just how important beach lifeguards are in preventing accidents.This year, however, things are very different. The RNLI is on the front foot. It is recruiting early for beach lifeguards in sensible anticipation of busy “staycation” UK beaches.So, my message to any sea-loving students uncertain about their future employment, who may be wary about spending a summer on the beach, or to any parents still convinced that an office is the only place to gain a good CV: there are few jobs which are better preparation for your career than lifeguarding, and few jobs as fun. In fact, perhaps it’s time I took a refresher course.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"one oxford covid jab stops transmission","story":"A single dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine prevents two-thirds of Covid transmissions, according to new results, raising hopes for the easing of restrictions by Easter.The data, released on Tuesday night, also revealed that the first jab prevents 100 per cent of hospitalisations after 22 days once an immune response has had time to develop. It came as the number of vaccine doses administered in the UK passed 10 million, with 9,646,715 first doses and 496,796 second doses.The number of Covid cases on Tuesday was at an eight-week low of 16,840. There were 1,449 further deaths, but the rolling seven-day total is down nearly 10 per cent. A Whitehall source said: These findings are exactly what we need. The finding on hospitalisations is particularly significant. At the moment, we have got restrictions in place to stop people dying and to prevent the NHS keeling over.Once you have protected these groups, even if there is some transmission it\u0027s a manageable problem – so we don\u0027t need the restrictions. It\u0027s looking good for schools returning in March, shops reopening in April. Published as a pre-print in the Lancet, the figures from the Oxford trial in the UK, South Africa and Brazil suggested the vaccine reduces transmission by 67 per cent after the first jab. Until now, it had not been confirmed whether vaccines can prevent transmission. Prevention of transmission is seen as key to lifting restrictions because it means those who have been vaccinated cannot infect those yet to receive the jab. The former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said: This is very significant and has a positive effect on coming out of lockdown as soon as possible. We have a chance to get the economy moving again quickly.Sir Iain added that he expected ministers to respond to the news by speeding up plans to lift restrictions, saying: It paves the way for the Government to get kids back to school and reopening the economy.A senior Government source insisted no virus restrictions could be lifted before the current earliest date of March 8. If all over-70s have been vaccinated by the target date of February 15, they will have developed immunity three weeks later.The source said: We hope it will be safe to commence the reopening of schools from March 8, with other economic and social restrictions being removed thereafter as and when the data permits.The study found a single dose was 76 per cent effective in fending off infection between 22 days and 90 days post-injection, rising to 82.4 per cent after a second dose at that stage. In a cohort of 12,408 people vaccinated with the first dose, not one was hospitalised during the period.   In a major vinciation of Government policy, the study also found that the vaccine is more effective overall if the second dose is delayed from 28 days until 90 days. The delay to the second jab had been criticised by European leaders amid a row over vaccine supply. On Tuesday, Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, accused ministers of compromising safety, while on Monday Clement Beaune, France\u0027s Europe minister, said Britain had taken a lot of risks by choosing to delay the second dose. Professor Andrew Pollard, the chief investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial and study co-author, said the data supports the policy recommendation made by the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation (JCVI) for a 12-week prime-boost interval as they look for the optimal approach to rollout, and reassures us that people are protected from 22 days after a single dose of the vaccine.  Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, welcomed the findings, saying: This is a hugely encouraging study and further reinforces our confidence that vaccines are capable of reducing transmission and protecting people from this awful disease. This report shows the Oxford vaccine works, and works well. More than 9.6 million people have already received the first dose of their Covid-19 vaccine, and the NHS is working tirelessly to vaccinate as many people as possible in every part of the UK.Doubt had also been cast in Europe over the efficacy of the vaccine for over-65s. On Tuesday, the French health authority followed the Germans in recommending the AstraZeneca jab only to those aged under 65, despite the European Medicines Agency approving it for all adults.  Although 5.7 per cent of the participants in the Oxford vaccine study were over 70, no one over age of 56 was assessed up to the 12-week stage.However, the results showed that, for over-55s, the vaccine was 16 per cent more effective at six to eight weeks compared with at three which might indicate that it continued to build immunity as time went on, in common with younger participants.  In further good news on Tuesday, a Government-sponsored study of people who caught Covid in the first wave revealed that 88 per cent retained antibodies that fight off infection for at least six months.However, those promising results followed the revelation that Covid in the UK is beginning to mimic the more worrying elements of the South African variant of the virus.Public Health England has detected dozens of cases with an E484K mutation to the spike protein, similar to the South African variant, which is expected to render current vaccines less effective. Studies have indicated that the current crop of vaccines are only 60 per cent effective against the South African variant because of the mutation.On Tuesday, Mr Hancock said the Government was working closely with pharmaceutical companies to engineer modifications to current vaccines. Researchers said a booster jab to protect the population from emerging strains could be developed in weeks and rolled out in months, raising the prospect that a third dose could be rolled out later this year.Professor Robin Shattock, leading Covid vaccine research at Imperial College London, suggested jabs would be likely to be given in addition to the current two-dose strategy as an annual booster after the first programme is rolled out.Meanwhile, a small study from Cambridge University suggested that elderly people could be left vulnerable to new variants after one dose of the Pfizer jab.The research, which included 15 people over the age of 80, found that one dose was not enough to protect them against a mutated strain. However, it also found that the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech appears to be effective against the Kent variant.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"philip hammonds bogus brexit history reveals true hostility","story":"It is good medical practice to respect patient confidentiality, but when Philip Hammond took to the political equivalent of the psychiatrist’s couch, the conversation was published in gory detail. Hammond has given an interview to a think tank in which he sought to write a bogus history of the Brexit talks, but succeeded only in revealing what he really got up to as chancellor.Hammond admits discussing using a second referendum to overturn Brexit with fellow Remainers. He decided against, in part, because “we didn’t actually think we’d win it”. Instead, he makes clear, he worked to undermine what Brexit would mean. Despite claiming to accept the referendum result, it is not obvious what Hammond thought Britain should leave. The single market? No. The customs union? No. The writ of the European Court of Justice? That was just “theological argument.Nor is he keen on Britain’s new freedoms. Supporting immigration control is “dogmatic”, he suggests, and we should have kept free movement rules. Neither is there much to gain from regulating our own economy. “The Bank of England was always keener on regulatory autonomy than the Treasury was,” he says, as though the Treasury ran the man supposed to run it.Instead, Hammond wanted a “very close associated orbit with the European Union”, in which Brussels set the rules and Britain followed. How many Brits might have been vaccinated in Hammond’s fantasy polity? The answer is remarkably few.This all reflects the man with whom I worked as chief of staff in Downing Street from 2016 to 2017. Unable to resist jabbing at Leave-supporting politicians, envious of Boris Johnson, ignorant of Parliament, contemptuous of ordinary people, resistant to public opinion, reluctant to concede the reality of what Brexit must mean, incredulous that Theresa May, a woman he believed his inferior, could become prime minister, he details a fantasy of what might have been.But it is a fantasy. His account of May’s Brexit speech to the 2016 Tory conference makes no sense. He says she retreated from it in her Lancaster House speech, but there she went further, promising to leave the single market and customs union. Without challenge, Hammond claims May’s speech almost caused a run on sterling. But while sterling fell, the drama came almost a week later after a “flash crash” in Asian markets. Sterling promptly recovered, and an independent investigation blamed a “confluence of factors”, noting it was one of “a series of flash events occurring in fast, electronic markets”.There are further discrepancies. Hammond says he was never a Leaver, but those who worked for him say he boasted for years that Britain must leave the EU. He claims he supported a Norway-style relationship from the start, but he did not say so to May.Hammond’s sneering towards Davis is typical. “Just because he was called the Brexit Secretary,” Davis thought “he was somehow going to control some of this process.” But when the boot was on the other foot, and Hammond was the minister feeling disempowered, he calls the resulting decisions a “coup”. When policy Hammond liked was stitched up in secret, that was just politics when policy was made despite his opposition, it was an outrage. When a Leave-supporting chief of staff drafted speeches, it was unacceptable when a “euro-pragmatist” did, it was commendable. It was his duty, he says, to “reinterpret” government policies he disliked.Thankfully, this is all now history, but history that should not be rewritten. The negotiating “red lines” he dismissed as unachievable have been achieved, Britain has left the EU, and Hammond no longer has to serve his constituents as a backbencher, work he said he “hated”. Instead, he is now a peer, and the best possible advertisement for the abolition of the House of Lords.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bleak outlook industrial towns without","story":"NewsBleak outlook for industrial towns without urgent Government action, warns reportEXCLUSIVE: The study investigates past plant closures and issues recommendations for the futuremirrorShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  FEB NewsThe study looks into the closure of the SSI site in Redcar in  \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The study, seen exclusively by the Mirror and published on Thursday, looks at how the impact of industrial change has been handled in two sectors – steelmaking and coal-fired electricity generation. The report highlights the devastation unleashed on Redcar, Teesside, by the closure of the SSI steelworks in  – which triggered the Mirroraposs Save Our Steel campaign. Some , workers lost their jobs but the Government response “showed limited preparedness” and demonstrated an “absence of learning from earlier experiences”, according to the study. It also claims the impact of steel plant closures on local communities “did not inspire a wider discussion” at either national or local government. More than four in five of the former steelworkers interviewed described government support as “inadequate”.  The study, ‘A Just Transition  Managing the challenges of technology, trade, climate change and Covid-’, was drawn up by Professor David Coats of the Centre for Sustainable Work and Employment Futures at Leicester University.His -page report, backed by the Community and Prospect trade unions and the Alex Ferry Foundation, warns of the unprecedented combination of coronavirus, globalisation and technological and climate change looming for Britainaposs industrial landscape.It says: “Nobody alive today has witnessed a comparable period of such deep economic uncertainty. “It is aswe are participants in a slow-motion traffic accident, where it is certain that something will go wrong, but the timing of the impact and the consequences for those involved is supremely unclear.

He told the Commons Business Select Committee: “I have never had a circumstance where before we have even begun formal negotiations, that the employer has put what our members quite correctly describe as a gun to their head and said that we sill sack and rehirenecessary the entire workforceyou do not agree to the changes that we want.”The bitter industrial dispute reached Parliament as MPs carried out an inquiry to companiesapos behaviour during the coronavirus pandemic.GMB members have staged  strikes this year and will walk out again on Friday for four days, as the union campaigns against new contracts it says cut pay and increase the working week for engineers under the fire and rehire policy. Some , redundancies are being made. Mr Bowden accused the company of poisoning the well by issuing formal notication of changes to contracts last summer before an agreement could be reached. Engineers are being told to work harder and faster, with a longer working week, he said. Calling for a ban on fire and rehire, Mr Bowden added: “It has no place in modern industrial relations, it is an utterly un-British type of mechanism.” Committee chairman Darren Jones said some tactics were “often used as a power play as opposed to trying to seek a negotiation, which is unfortunate”. He added: There is no doubt that many businesses have faced dficult trading conditions, but concerns have been raised that some employers are resorting to tactics such as aposfire and rehireapos and seeking to downgrade pay and workersapos terms during the pandemic. Labour MP Judith Cummins said the committee was probing whether British Gasaposs parent company Centrica was “taking advantage of a Covid pandemic to fire and rehire staff – and vast amounts of staff at that”."},{"url":null,"title":"ministers under pressure boost self","story":"NewsMinisters under pressure to boost self-isolation support as councils face shortfallsEXCLUSIVE TUC analysis of  English local authorities shows demand for the discretionary schemes has outstripped allocated budgetsmirrorShareCommentsByPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political Editor:,  FEB NewsJust one in five applicants end up with extra support \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

TUC analysis of  English local authorities shows demand for the discretionary schemes has outstripped allocated budgets. It means that just one in five applicants end up with extra support from these programmes to help them stay at home. Overall, two in five of those applying to the main self-isolation scheme get the £ grant. The study shows that one in four local authorities had either run out of funding for the discretionary scheme or were close to doing so. Some councils have been forced to reject applications, fill the gap themselves or even close the schemes as a result. The Government offers a one-off £ payment for those who need to self-isolate because of Covid but can’t work from home. Ministers recently announced an additional £m for this, including £m for councils to distribute at their discretion. These funds are for applicants who don’t meet the strict criteria for the main self-isolation scheme. But the TUC claimed the funding was “too little too late” as it would not be enough to satisfy demand. The union body warned that a lack of decent sick pay was a “gaping hole” in the UK’s approach to the pandemic. It currently stands at £. a week but the TUC wants in to be raised to the real Living Wage of £ a week.

Now you can celebrate Captain Tom your way by writing your own tribute to him using the form here...Captain Tom was made an honorary colonel of the Army Foundation College for his efforts, and later invested as a Knight Bachelor at Windsor Castle.

Then, on January , at .am, the day before he died, he wrote another Facebook post with a picture of his positive coronavirus test result.In it, he wrote: Another week off work then. At least I know I wasnapost just being girly with a normal cold though!Known as a funny and loving father, Kevin collapsed at home and died a day later, Wales Online reports. In his post on January , he wrote: Worst night ever last night. Climbed the stairs at pm, started coughing and was still coughing after .pm. Finally dropped off, but only for an hour, then the coughing came back. Coughing blood in the early hours. Dropped off about am and was back up by am.Have you been personally affected by coronavirus  Let us know in the comments belowHis brother, -year-old Stuart Woolley, said Kevinaposs rapid decline was a huge and distressing shock for the family and that they wanted to raise awareness of just how devastating coronavirus can be. Despite being previously healthy, Stuart said his brother was found unconscious by his partner Carol in their Abercynon home on the morning of January . Paramedics were called, but sadly there was nothing more they could do to save him, he said. Train driver Stuart said that since his brotheraposs death, heaposd found it particularly frustrating seeing and hearing of members of the public breaking Covid- rules.  He said: Iaposm a key worker and while Iaposm, travelling around the country, I see people breaking the rules all the time - people with no masks, with masks under their nose, and itaposs so frustrating. You just want to go up and shake them and say look, it can take anyone. Kevin had no known underlying illnesses, he went to the gym and his fishing would get him up and about, as far as Iaposm aware there was nothing known to be underlying and the post mortem hasnapost picked anything  up. Stuart said his brotheraposs death came as an even bigger shock after his own experience with coronavirus, which he completely recovered from. He contacted me the day before his test and asked what my symptoms were, Stuart said. I said I had a phlegmy cough and he said he was coughing up some blood - not a massive amount. I think the only other symptom he really had was loss of appetite compare to usual. I previously had coronavirus and when he tested positive, I said to him on the group chat that itaposll knock you out for a week or so and fingers crossed youaposll get through it. Thataposs what happened to me, I rested and recovered. He had his test on January , the results on January  and he passed away on the morning of January . The funeral was only last week, so that knocked us for six.  Kevin is also survived by his three children, Joshua , Ffion, , and his youngest son Oscar, seven, from his previous marriage. According to Stuart, his brother was also cherished by his work colleagues at Stagecoach as well as the many people he met through his biggest passion, fishing. Stuart said: He enjoyed playing football when he was younger for a couple of local teams, but then, for the last  years, fishing took over his le. And thataposs the main thing that people have been getting in touch with me about - the fact he would organise their first fishing boat trips. He was doing so much with other people in the fishing fraternity. It was incredible seeing the amount of people who got in touch with me about him after his passing. He had been a bus and coach driver for around  years, he worked for Megabus and the local bus companies but it was mostly Stagecoach - he was working on the service buses when he passed. I had been talking to his boss at Stagecoach and they agreed for a bus to come and drive through Wattsville on the morning of his funeral in tribute to him. It had his name on the front and was driven by one of the guys he used to go fishing with.

As Britain faced perhaps its toughest crisis since the Second World War, the determination of a grandad who had survived that conflict  years earlier brought a struggling nation together. Unlike most veterans, Captain Tom – as he became affectionately known across the country – will not be best remembered for the heroic deeds that brought him military medals. He will instead be remembered for a simple act of humble heroism saved until last. An elderly man supported by a walking frame who kept going for the millions of others who watched him taking those slow steps.   Captain Tom was a symbol of British defiance in the face of an unseen enemy. His passing at the very moment the UK seems to be slowly emerging from the crisis thanks to the vaccine programme will make the blow even harder for the millions who admired him. Thomas Moore was born in Keighley, West Yorks, on April , . The son of a builder and a head teacher, he attended the local grammar school and remained in the town for much of his le. After leaving school he began an apprenticeship in civil engineering. In , when he was , Tom was conscripted into the Army to fight in the war. Placed with the th Battalion, Duke of Wellington’s Regiment, he was initially stationed in Cornwall. Marked out as a recruit with potential, he was selected for officer training and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in June .  Later that year he became a member of the Royal Armoured Corps and was transferred to another battalion in India. In Mumbai and Kolkata he was given the task of setting up and managing a training programme for Army motorcyclists. The following year he was promoted to temporary captain. As part of the Fourteenth Army – which became known as the Forgotten Army – he served in Arakan in western Burma, modern-day Myanmar. During the campaign to overcome Japanese forces, he survived dengue fever.  He ed to Britain in February , and was a tank instructor at Bovington Camp in Dorset until he was demobbed the following year. Afterwards, Tom would race his Scott motorbike around Yorkshire and won several cups and medals. He also organised his regiment’s annual reunion for  years. Captain Tom met second we Pamela when he was in his s and working as a salesman.  The pair married in  and had two daughters. Tom, who became managing director of a concrete company, was a contestant on BBC game show Blankety Blank in  aged . He and his we retired to Spain, ing to Britain when she needed specialist care in a nursing home after being diagnosed with dementia. They were together for nearly  years until her death in .  Tom then moved in with his daughter Hannah, her husband and his grandchildren, Georgia and Benjie, in the village of Marston Moretaine, Beds. Tom continued to lead a full le, driving each day until he slipped and fractured his hip in . It was the care he received in hospital, along with the treatment he received after he had skin cancer, that made Captain Tom so keen to give something back to the NHS.  Determined to be in the best shape following his injury, Captain Tom ordered a treadmill. His daughter Lucy said later: “How many -year-olds order a running machine  That raised a few eyebrows when it arrived. “But he wanted to improve his ability to walk in the winter because he knew he’d be sitting around more.” As the pandemic stretched doctors and nurses to the limit, Captain Tom and his family came up with the idea for his sponsored walk. On  April last year, Tom set out to complete  s of his garden, covering  severy day with the help of his walking frame.  They called it Tom’s th Birthday Walk for the NHS. It soon captured widespread attention, and he achieved his initial fundraising goal of £, for NHS Charities Together within four days. The target was increased to £,. Captain Tom reached his  s on April , watched over by a guard of honour from the st Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment. He said: “For all those finding it dficult: the sun will shine on you again and the clouds will go away.”  Tom told the Sunday Mirror: “My message to the nation is, tomorrow will be a good day. We will get through this and come out of it stronger.” By his th birthday at the end of the month, he had raised almost £million, a world record for the JustGiving fundraising site. The final amount was close to £m after gt aid tax relief on donations. On his birthday he was appointed an Honorary Colonel of the Army Foundation College in Harrogate, North Yorks. His centenary was marked by two military flypasts, while an express train has been named in his honour and his local postbox repainted in the colours of the NHS.  Over , birthday cards were sent to him – so many they were stored at his grandson Benjie’s school. Captain Tom also become the oldest person to get a No hit, courtesy of his fundraising version of You’ll Never Walk Alone with singer Michael Ball. Tom, a quiet man from Yorkshire, had become a national icon. Also in April, he was presented with a Daily Mirror Pride of Britain Award. Nearly a million people signed a petition calling for him to be knighted. His investiture by the Queen took place in the quadrangle at Windsor Castle in July. Captain Tom was the only person honoured at the unique ceremony, which was the monarch’s first official engagement since lockdown started. Since then, Tom has been presented with a string of awards, including several honorary university degrees. He was also awarded a Defence Medal after experts realised he had been owed one for decades. Tom also became the oldest cover star of British GQ in the magazine’s -year history. He graces the front of the January February  issue. He was honoured with the magazine’s Inspiration award at the GQ Men of the Year Awards last year. As a thank you on behalf of the nation, Captain Tom and his family were presented with a trip to Barbados by British Airways at the end of . It proved to be his last journey.

In the run up to Christmas, stores displayed signs directly above racks of animal-fur garments reading, “No Fur Product Is Stocked in House of Fraser.” In much smaller print, the sign continues, “”. In the Edinburgh store, the notice was displayed above coats from French brand Pyrenex which are trimmed with raccoon-dog fur. PETA has reported the signs to Trading Standards who said they will investigate. “We are asking Trading Standards to stop House of Fraser from trying to dupe customers into buying the animal-fur products that no kind shopper wants,” says PETA Director Elisa Allen. “If House of Fraser wants to advertise that ‘no fur product is stocked’ in its stores, it can simply take the fur coats, collars, and cuffs off its racks.”What do you think  Let us know in the comments belowOver a decade ago the chain stopped selling real fur products. In  the companies then Head of Sustainability presented evidence to an MP enquiry saying, “We know from asking our customers that they are not interested in buying real fur…we do not want to have real fur in our stores.” But the chain, which was taken over by Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley, has now been dubbed “House of Horrors” by fur campaigners after it started selling fur again. The decision to reverse its policy is unusual and makes it one of a dwindling number of high street retailers to stock real fur as shoppers have grown more ethically conscious. Items currently on sale include a beanie hat with a raccoon dog pom pom for £, a kids boy jacket made with Canadian coyote fur and adult jackets made with a Finnish raccoon dog trims made by Pyrenex and Parajumpers.Claire Bass, Executive Director at Humane Society International UK, which is campaigning alongside the Daily Mirror to stop fur sales in the UK, said: “House of Fraser’s decision to overturn its long-standing fur-free policy, at a time when retailers and designers are increasingly dropping fur for being cruel and old-fashioned, makes the brand look out of touch with consumer trends and demands. Last year it was discovered that other animals reared for their fur – such as foxes and raccoon dogs – can catch coronaviruses and pass it to humans, scientists have warned, after millions of mink across Europe were culled over fears they could spread Covid-.

The message came following reports that the couple removed aposRachel Meghanapos, the Duchessapos first and middle names, from the legal document a month after he was born, using the more formal aposHer Royal Highness the Duchess of Sussexapos instead.The couple claimed the change was dictated by the Palace, adding that reports it was a snub to other members of the royal family would be laughable were it not offensive. The firmly worded message has caused bewilderment among palace staff. An aide told The Mirror: There is no set protocol with these things. The birth certicate is a civic document so there are options on how it is filled out. The language used suggesting it was aposthe Palaceapos who aposdictatedapos it is somewhat unfortunate, as it certainly wasnapost addressed like that. The statement and its wording poses more questions than it answers unfortunately.  Meghan and Harryaposs statement, which was released to The Independent on Sunday, read: “The change of name on public documents in  was dictated by The Palace, as confirmed by documents from senior Palace officials. This was not requested by Meghan, The Duchess of Sussex nor by The Duke of Sussex. They added that the outlet’s claim of a potential “snub” would be “laughable were it not offensive”. “To see this UK tabloid and their carnival of so-called ‘experts’ choose to deceptively whip this into a calculated family ‘snub’ and suggest that she would oddly want to be nameless on her child’s birth certicate, or any other legal document, would be laughable were it not offensive. “There’s a lot going on in the world let’s focus on that rather than creating clickbait.” Keep up to date with all the latest news from the Queen, Charles, Wiliaml, Kate, Harry, Meghan, George, Charlotte, Louis and the rest of the family.

However, another source has told The Mirror that the change did actually come from the Sussex staff, not the Palace. Royal editor Russell Myers explains: One royal source revealed to me that Meghan ordered her staff to make the change to Archieaposs birth certicate in order to to fall in line with amendments sheaposd already made to her passport. The amendment was made by Meghan and Harryaposs personal team when they had their own staff based at Kensington Palace, who in turn reported to Buckingham Palace, so the sharp rebuke of the Palace makes even less sense.  In short, Meghan already stylised herself as aposHRH The Duchess of Sussexapos, dropping her given names - and wanted some form of continuity."},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper tablet offer promotion","story":"NewsGet The Mirror free on tablet for two months*Its packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownmirrorShareByDave Masters:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Our free email newsletter sends you the biggest headlines from news, sport and showbizWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The advert encouraged consumers to book Easter and summer holidays with the airline after having received vaccinations, suggesting that people could jab and go. Footage showed groups of people in their s and s enjoying the holiday destinations. Complaints were made by people who felt jab and go implied that most of the UK population would be able to travel unaffected by coronavirus regulations by summer . Others felt that the advert trivialised ongoing restrictions and effects of the pandemic on society and iniduals, and challenged whether it was offensive. Ryanair said important contextual factors needed to be taken into account when considering the advert, including the general awareness of the public around the national vaccination programme and the constantly changing restrictions on international travel. The company said it had made no specic claims about who, when or how vaccines would be administered, or how long it would take for people to become fully protected.  It added that it believed the Governmentaposs optimistic briefings implied that a signicant proportion of the population would be vaccinated midway through the year. Ryanair said the advert had intended to be uplting and encourage viewers to consider a brighter future when people could go on holiday with friends and family again. It did not consider the content was insensitive to people who had had Covid- or who had lost people to the virus, or to those working on the front line of the pandemic.

The sheet was discovered by Rosa Beckerton’s husband Peter, , while he was refurbishing an old piece of furniture for a client. It is dated February , , and appears to be written by an -year-old girl imagining the state of the world in . She correctly predicts a huge sht in technology and even forecasts the Zoom revolution. Describing her husband’shome from work she writes: “’Hello dear,’ he said to me. ‘I’ve just got to ring up my friend on the telephone’.What do you think about the schoolgirlaposs predictions  Let us know in the comments“’Well you’d better tidy yourself up a bit,’ I said. “In  the telephone was a square box thing with a resiver [sic] on top of it. “But now it is still a resiver [sic], but you can see the people you are talking to, for there is a screen where you can see the people. It is a bit like a television.” Upholsterer Peter found the note stuffed down the back of a sofa which was sent to him for restoration after being bought second-hand.  Rosa, , from Peterborough, Cambs., decided to make the it public in case the author, who would now be aged around , is still alive. She said: “When my husband showed it to me I couldn’t believe it. I thought oh my god, look at this. “It was just so interesting, because looking at it today she’s got a lot of her predictions kind of right - but in her childish innocent way she thought it would all happen in ten years.  “I just wanted to share it in the hopes that maybe the author might see it and recognise it. “My husband has found all sorts of rubbish down the side of sofas and furniture before - but never anything as interesting as this.” The letter is unnamed but comes complete with a teacher’s corrections and comments in red pen - including the verdict ‘Good’.  It begins: “The year is , the time is half-past moon dust. Here I am twenty-one years of age, sitting in a cushion of air. “I remember when I was  years old and I was at school, things have changed since then. “For instance, the television has changed. “In  it was a square box with knobs in front of it. Now it is a big screen with knobs on your chair arm to switch it on and off.” The schoolgirl imagines that she is a married bank worker. She says in times past she would have “prepared tea” ready for her husband to come home. But she adds: “All we have is a piece of chewing gum to eat.

Caroline Abbott, , was attempting to do her weekly shop in the supermarket in Fulbourn, Cambridgeshire, last Friday when a security guard stopped her for trying to enter with her kids, aged three and eight. The mum-of-three called the experience humiliating and said she does not knowshe canto the store again. Caroline told Cambridgeshire Live that a security guard stopped her and asked where the children’s father was. She said: “The security guard said the children weren’t allowed in the store and I should leave them outside. I explained I was a single mum but he said they should still be at home with their father. At this point, I was holding up a long queue.” After allegedly still refusing her entry another staff member intervened and directed Caroline to the customer service desk where she could speak to a manager. Caroline, a key worker at Addenbrooke’s hospital, said until now, she has never had any issues with her weekly shop throughout the pandemic. She said: “No one chooses to be a single parent and I wouldn’t risk my children’s health going into these shopsI had another choice.” "},{"url":null,"title":"touching last photo captain sir","story":"NewsTouching last photo of Captain Sir Tom Moore, , and his family days before he diedWorld War Two veteran and NHS hero Captain Sir Tom Moore died aged  on Tuesday in Bedford Hospital following a brief battle with Covid- and pneumoniamirrorShareCommentsByRyan Merrield:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsCaptain Sir Tom Moore tragically died on Sunday \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Our free email newsletter sends you the biggest headlines from news, sport and showbizWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

They warn that ‘ignoring this will be at our peril’ as those with a mild infection are unwittingly spreading the disease, thinking it is just a winter bug.Dr Alex Sohal, a GP in Tower Hamlets, east London, said : These patients have frequently not even considered that they may have Covid- and have not self-isolated in the crucial early days when they were most infectious. “The national publicity campaign focuses on cough, high temperature, and loss of smell or taste as symptoms to be aware of—only patients with these symptoms are able to access a Covid- test online through the NHS test booking site. GPs have to advise patients to be dishonest to get aCovid- test. “It is vital to now change the UK Covid- case definition and test criteria to include coryza [runny nose] and cold, making them consistent with WHO. “Tell the public, especially those who have to go out to work and their employers, that even those with mild symptomsshould not go out, prioritising the first five days of self-isolation when they are most likely to be infectious.

London is very much among the worst offenders and across the pond in New York it doesnapost appear to be much dferent - and a property expert based in the US may have found one of the most bonkers deals on the market yet.A realtor based in the city, known as @Newyorkcityrealtor on TikTok, has gained millions of views by showing off some of the places available for rent in the Big Apple.One of his latest videos has racked up more than  million views alone as he says: People ask me aposwhat is the worst apartment youaposve ever seen apos Iaposm going to show you. As the door swings open he quickly claries: And before you ask, yes, this is a real apartment. The flat consists of a single room with the hardwood floor space measuring up to roughly the size of a double bed and will set you back an eye-watering sum of £,per month in rent in the most desired neighbourhood in New York City of the West Village. The realtor gives the aposgrand tourapos pointing out its sparse features including a mini fridge, one narrow cupboard, a sink and a couple of kitchen bedroom cabinets. Thereaposs no oven, no stove, and no bathroom facilities in the room at all.  In a second video, the tour continues out into the corridor to find the toilet which is literally just as bad as you can possibly imagine. A key accesses a single toilet in a cramped room that barely leaves enough space to open the door - which is shared by everyone  in the complex and does not have a sink. Further down the corridor is a single shower in a similar sized room, again shared by everyone  in the building, but does come with the added bonus of a rack of shared soaps for your convenience. People were left baffled as to who would pay the high price to rent the flat, as one commented to say: So basically you get a closet.

Some people have reported that the area where the jab was received area becomes itchy and irritated in the days afterward. One woman said her reaction was so severe sheaposs having second thoughts about getting the second dose - but doctors have quickly moved to allay any fears.Amelia Brown, who lives in Visalia, Calornia sent FOX pictures of her arm just days after getting her first dose of the vaccine on January .Have you had aposCovid armapos  Email your pictures to webnews@mirror Getting the shot was easy, according to Brown. “They gave me the shot, I actually didn’t even feel it to be honest, said Brown. Shortly afterward however Brown began to feel dizzy and had a minor allergic reaction. “In an over abundance of caution, they had me go and visit the hospital just to ensure that I was ok, said Brown, I was, I’m here, I’m happy and the next day I went to work, not a problem.”Brown says the injection site was tender for a few days afterward, but it was nothing major. Then, on Monday, January , exactly one week after her first dose, Brown says the area became itchy and irritated. “It was just red and angry and had hives. Like you could feel the bumps.” The very next morning, Brown says she woke up with a lump. “It had just grown overnight from like, a dollar size to like, a baseball size, said Brown, And it was very swollen, hot to the touch, sore, evenI wore my coat that day, the pressure of the coat was painful. Brown says she spoke with a few dferent medical professionals who advised her to leave it alone unless it got worse. Dr Praveen Buddiga, an immunologist in the region, said: aposCovid armapos is basically a delayed type of hypersensitivity or an allergic reaction that occurs about probably  to  days afterward.

You can unsubscribe at any time.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid Email A single dose of the vaccine from Pfizer or Moderna is enough to protect people who have previously been infected with coronavirus, new research suggests.Two papers, which have not yet been peer-reviewed, found that a single shot of either vaccine produced high concentrations of antibodies, often exceeding the level seen for those given two doses. People who had previously suffered coronavirus were also more likely to report flu-like side-effects after their vaccine as their immune response was re-stimulated, experts said. In the first paper, from researchers at the School of Medicine at Mount Sinai New York,  people were recruited, of whom  were negative for previous infection and  had had Covid- before.Have you had Covid-  Let us know in the comments  The results showed that, after a single dose, people who had been infected previously rapidly developed antibody concentrations which were  to  times higher than those without prior infection, at the same time points after the jab. The authors said they are providing evidence that the antibody response to the first vaccine dose in iniduals with pre-existing immunity is equal to or even exceeds that found in people without prior infection, even after the second dose. Changing the policy to give these iniduals only one dose of vaccine would not negatively impact on their antibody titers, spare them from unnecessary pain and free up many urgently needed vaccine doses, they wrote.  The second paper, from the University of Maryland in the US, looked at antibody responses to a single dose of the Pfizer BioNTech or Moderna vaccines in healthcare workers who had had a positive test for Covid-, and compared them with those who were negative for antibodies to the virus. Overall,  healthcare workers were involved in the study. The results showed that those who had had Covid- previously had statistically signicant higher levels of antibodies than those without, and had a classic secondary response to a single inoculation.  The authors concluded: In times of vaccine shortage, and until correlates of protection are identied, our findings preliminarily suggest the following strategy as more evidence-based: a a single dose of vaccine for patients already having had laboratory-confirmed Covid- and b patients who have had laboratory-confirmed Covid- can be placed lower on the vaccination priority list. In the UK, health officials have recommended that the second dose of any of the vaccines in use can be safely given up to  weeks after the first.  This has proved controversial, with some groups, including the British Medical Association , calling for doses of the Pfizer jab to be given no more than six weeks apart. Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious disease, University of Edinburgh, said of the latest studies: The data presented in these two papers are not surprising but are very reassuring. Both papers show that a previous infection with Covid- primes the immune system to make a very robust response to a single dose of Covid- vaccine.  These data indicate that the vaccines are very effectively boosting the immunity induced by infection. The authors of both papers suggest that people who have had a PCR-confirmed Covid- infection may only require one dose of the vaccine. Certainly, this would appear to provide them with protection that is at least as good as two doses of vaccine. However, incorporating this into a mass vaccination programme may be logistically complex and it may be safer, overall, to ensure that everyone gets two doses. She pointed to the evidence suggesting that people previously infected were more likely to experience flu-like symptoms after their vaccine. This is good to know and will allow healthcare workers to warn people that they are more likely to feel a little off colour for a day two after their vaccinationthey have previously been infected and to reassure them that this is nothing to be concerned about.

Finding his opinion hilarious, Layke decided to share it on Reddit, where the review went viral. Layke uploaded the review to the social media , writing: My French friend has lived in the UK for almost three years and has never been to Greggs.Obviously being British I just couldn’t let it go, so I got Greggs sausage roll delivered to his door.An hour later he sent me this. Alongside this was a photo of the detailed review, which took Nicholas over an hour and a half to write. It reads: I know British people are sometimes described as explorers or pioneers. And I have to admit that Gregg’s managed to do something groundbreaking with their sausage roll.  As I chewed and swallowed I simply couldn’t understand how something could taste so bland yet so revolting at the same time. Amazing.The crust tastes like cardboard that was passed through a food blender and then compressed together into a puff pastry. “The sausage is all over the place, sometimes it feels like mushy gelatin, sometimes it’s spicy. Yet I chewed through it and bite after bite I could see it’s intrinsic value. I canapost say I liked it, probably because I didnapost, but it was alright and it gets the job done to fill you up.  Nicholas went on to admit that he didnapost eat very much of the sausage, bean and cheese melt as it reminded him of the awful food heaposd eaten at school which didnapost hold a candle to his familyaposs cooking. He added that even though he didnapost enjoy the food, he was glad heaposd had the experience and now understood why people go to Greggs. I now appreciate why some guys in the morning go ‘d’you know wha’ mate  I could really go for sum fooking sausage roll now’. I get it now, he explained. That’s what Gregg’s is. It’s like a nice neighbour. He sits there quietly and when you need him to help you fill up after a rough night, he will be there for you.” "},{"url":null,"title":"man hailed diy king after","story":"NewsMan hailed DIY king after showing how he paints a whole wall in  secondsThe most recent DIY hack to capture peoples attention comes courtesy of a man who, when painting a room, showed how he completed the arduous task in less than  secondsmirrorShareCommentsByRosaleen FentonExclusives Reporter:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror lestyle video man-shares-easy-way-paints-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

In the caption, the TikTok user complained: The things you learn after all these years!! I have thrown so much out! In the video, the TikTok user showed how rinsing out the container didnapost remove the stains. Instead, they put a wet paper towel in and some washing up liquid and added more water in before putting the lid back on. After shaking it vigorously for  seconds, they tipped out the sudsy water and disposed of the paper towel.  And they were left with a sparkling clean container with no stains - result! Since being posted, the video has racked up . million likes and thousands of comments. One person commented: Iaposve learned more on TikTok in the past  months than I did  years in school.

Dave Ayres, , didnapost realise the ventilation pipes in the building in Austria had been sealed off for winter, the Liverpool Echo reports. He then ed to the building and lit a stove for warmth while he slept - which is thought to have poisoned the air and killed him. The pipes were apparently sealed up by maintenance workers in November. Daveaposs body was then found in the hut on January , prompting a flood of tributes for the Birkenhead-born man. Got a story  Email webnews@mirror.  It is understood that the trained chef was born in the Merseyside town before he moved to Greece with his parents in his s. He is said to have also had a degree in tourism and have travelled to ious locations around the world before settling in Brand. Villagers in the Austrian ski village where Dave worked are now deciding how to best honour the instructor. Fellow instructor and colleague Angelika Beck said she wants to make sure his memory lives on in the area. She said: It has been hard to track Dave’s parents, so we will not be burying his body here in Brand for the time being. But we will make sure he is never ever forgotten and make a memorial to him. Perhaps a tree dedicated to him in the forest park where he worked in summer, or a plaque, or a cross on the slopes - we are working out the details. Dave also worked as a park warden in the forest climbing centre and became a close friend of Kai Salinger.  Kai said: Dave was full of kindness, generosity and humour, always laughing and making everyone smile. But very driven and professional too. Klaus Bitschi, the local mayor, said: Dave’s work with the children in the climbing park was sensational. He was warm-hearted, and talented - always ready to help everyone. He will remain deep in our hearts. A memorial for Dave will take place in Brand on February .

About  people that he is currently treating are facing erection problems following recent infections, he claimed. The patients are between  and  years old, he said. He said: A mild infection is no guarantee that a person will be spared from long-term effects.Have you had coronavirus  Let us know in the comments belowOther doctors, including US scientist Dr Dena Grayson, have similar opinions.

The photograph shows what initially appears to be an unremarkable outdoor swimming pool with nobody inside the water. Except a circled area of the poolreveals that a child is in fact beneath the water but practically invisible to the naked eye. The child was captured wearing pale blue shorts swimming near the bottom of the swimming pool but because of the colour he would prove dficult to see by anyone observing.Australian Facebook group CPR Kids, run by expert paediatric nurses, shared the image in a bid to warn parents to make sure their children wear visible and brightly coloured clothing while in the water.  On Facebook the group said: Yes, there is a child there, itaposs hard to believe we know. Following on from out post recently on the importance of fluoroand bright coloured swimwear for kids, one of the CPR Kids Educators was at a pool party with friends and noticed how cloudy the water had become after being used all day. She asked one of the children who was wearing a pale blue swimsuit, to swim to the bottom. The result shocked her, as it did everyone in the CPR Kids team. The original Facebook post has attracted hundreds of comments from those who were shocked by the stark image, and it has since been widely shared since it was put online.  ridiculously beautul photos from the Travel Photographer of the Year awards"},{"url":null,"title":"model told cover up plane","story":"NewsModel told to cover up on plane because outfit was inappropriate for flyingInstagram and OnlyFans model Isabelle Eleanore was humiliated when a Jetstar flight attendant told her \"you cant wear a bikini\" as she tried to board a plane flying from Gold Coast to Melbourne in AustraliamirrorShareCommentsByChris KitchingSenior News Reporter:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video model-humiliated-after-flight-attendant-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Isabelle Eleanore was wearing a black crop top and blue jeans when the cabin crew member stopped her while boarding and said the outfit was inappropriate for flying. The Instagram and Only Fans model said the Jetstar flight attendant suggested she wear a jumper to cover her upper body, adding: You canapost wear a bikini. Isabelle was handed a hi-vis vest to wear over the crop top and felt embarrassed and degraded as she wore it while walking down the aisle in front of other passengers. Have you had a similar experience recently  Email your story to webnews@mirror. She said her outfit wasnapost inappropriate or revealing, and believes she would have been treated dferentlyshe had smaller breasts or was a man. Low-cost airline Jetstar has since apologised and said there was a misunderstanding of the airlineaposs policy on the part of the flight attendant. Isabelle said the incident happened as she boarded a flight from Gold Coast to Melbourne in Australia on Monday night. She told News: She looked at the ticket and then looked up and said, aposOh, do you have a jumper you can wear apos and then hereaposs me thinking she must be concerned Iaposm going to get cold on the flight, itaposs going to be cold in Melbourne or something.She kept going and she was like, aposWell, you canapost fly with what youaposre wearing, you canapost wear a bikiniapos. And Iaposm like, aposLook - itaposs not a bikini, itaposs a topapos. Isabelle, who was travelling with her husband, Jeremy Szwarcbord, said the flight attendant called over the rest of the crew to look for something she could wear over the crop top. The couple didnapost have a jumper or another top in their hand luggage as they boarded the two-hour domestic flight. The flight attendant then ed with a hi-vis vest for Isabelle to wear until she disembarked in Melbourne. She then had to walk down the aisle to her seat as other passengers looked on. Isabelle said she felt victimised, degraded and embarrassed while everyone was looking at her.She agreed to wear the vest because she feared she would be kicked off the flightshe refused. Isabelle said she spoke to eight other Jetstar staff members before boarding and none of them mentioned anything about her clothing being inappropriate. She added: I didnapost think Iaposd have to deal with something like that - itaposs , I should be able to wear what I want to wear. Jeremy said his weaposs outfit wasnapost inappropriate and didnapost violate the airlineaposs policy against offensive clothing. The airline does not have a policy regarding crop tops.Isabelle wrote an Instagram post complaining about the incident and shared photos of the outfit she was wearing. She wrote to her , followers: So they made a huge scene when I stepped on the plane and made me wait in front of everyone while they searched for something to cover me up with. Then I had to walk all the way to my seat wearing this vest . This is discrimination and humiliation Jet Star Australia. Apparently my top is too small and I couldnapost fly without covering up.  If I had small breasts I guarantee they wouldnapost have said anything. They forced me to put on hi-vis vest. Am I lost... is it  not   Jetstaraposs website states there are minimum dress requirements for its flights and offensive clothing is banned.

The officials ruled it hadn’t crossed the line and, while video footage appeared inconclusive, McInnes felt it should have stood.He said: “We spoke a lot about the conditions and the wind swirling around, so there would be a real need for concentration.“It was such a poor start and we stepped into Livingston’s plan, they stepped off the game then really hunted us at the right times.“The goal unnerved us, there’s no doubt about it # it was a terrible goal to lose.“The second goal was every bit as bad. It wasn’t an inidual error, but it should have been dealt with so much better.“It was such a poor performance, especially in the first half, and half-time couldn’t come quickly enough.“Second half was more controlled, but unfortunately we were the ones doing the chasing and they had something to hold on to.“The second half was far more what we’d expect, we got the ball into their box.“The goalshould stand, it’s such an important part of the game.“It was so important at that stage of the game for players to get a lt because it was a fantastic striker, but it wasn’t to be.“The first half killed us.”McInnes handed debuts to deadline day loan signings Fraser Hornby and Callum Hendry and hopes to have Florian Kamberi involved for Saturday’s clash with third-placed Hibs at Easter Road.Aberdeen are awaiting a work permit for the Albanian striker and McInnes added: “We are waiting on his clearance, everything has gone through, so we are hoping #he gets his work permit # he can fly over tomorrow or Thursday.“A lot of things need to fall our way for him to be involved on Saturday.”On facing Hibs, he said: “We are going to have to improve on that performance tonight.“Nobody will probably give us a chance on Saturday, we have swapped places with Hibs all season.“But we went down there before this season and won with a big performance and that’s what we need to do again.“We are missing too many opportunities this season.“It’s getting to the business end of the season and we still have it all to do. The run-in will determine what our season is going to look like.”The Dons lost Ryan Hedges to a pectoral problem early on and then Ash Taylor shortly before half-time with a thigh problem.McInnes said: “Ash has a thigh injury and Hedges has a problem with his shoulder and is in a sling.“He’s in a lot of pain, so we have to hope it not too serious to keep him out for a period of time.”Livingston manager David Martindale said: “I was really proud of them tonight.“It has always been a dficult place to come.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities. The remainder, £,,, is mostly allocated to single-use ferry facilities, and a huge proportion of that is to provide overnight parking for CalMac ferriesreaders will have to make up their own minds about the merits of spending £,, for an overnight berth at Fionnphort, and £, on a feasibility study for a breakwater at Lismore.CMAL pay back around half of the £,, to the council through harbour dues for the use of council-owned piers, however, that still leaves a whopping £ million gap in the required funding.If past experience of other CMAL projects is anything to go by, the planned eight per cent increase in council harbour fees and charges up to   is not going to cover it.Fergus Gillanders, KilmelfordSir,Last year, , was challenging and, although many people like to give generously to charity at Christmas time, it may have been dficult to make a donation this festive season.It#s not too late # you can still help support the Royal National Institute of Blind Peopleby collecting and donating used stamps from cards and parcels you may have received.Your stamps will be recycled and turned into vital funds that will help RNIB support children with vision impairment.

Some do exist, however, and while not attempting to be a comprehensive history, there is a nicely illustrated booklet about the hospital and its past entitled #Up The Brae#, produced a few years ago by Brenda Bratt, Jess Grant and my former colleague Dr Grace Fergusson .These photographs are a reminder of the loss of a signicant social and economic element in the fabric of Mid Argyll, where for generations it would have been dficult to find a family without some connection to #the AB#. For those who worked there, myself included, any sadness however is much more about the loss of a self-sufficient and widely respected mental health service.I was a late participant in the story of the AB, being appointed physician superintendent in , a post I held in addition to that of clinical director for mental health services for Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire until , and I feel a duty to the many splendid colleagues with whom I worked to comment on the loss of the service in which the AB served as the nucleus.During the course of   the hospital was awarded the accolade #Best Mental Illness Hospital in Britain# as the result of a national competition launched by the King’s Fund and sponsored by the Sunday Times. This was a recognition of the multi-disciplinary spirit and enthusiasm for innovation that characterised the service, and the ethos of best clinical practice being led by academic excellence. The service went on to be recognised as a centre of excellence by many visiting accreditation bodies.My reason for making these points has nothing to do with nostalgia.The past has no utility in the present or the future except as a source for learning how best to proceed.The ingredients for a good mental health service are the same today as they were in  and they have little to do with buildings or even location. Staff have to feel they #belong# to something there must be a collegiate spirit binding together the ious disciplines shared professional development and peer support and clear lines of accountability. It is frankly hard to see any such features in the current delivery of mental health care.Someone once said #psychiatry isn’t sexy#, meaning that in any competition for resources with other clinical specialities, psychiatry will always lose, and so to get the best out of the NHS for folk with psychiatric disorder, exceptional effort is required. The achievements and values of the past can act as a springboard for such effort, but here they seem to have been squandered by a distant and disinterested health board.It is all too easy to avoid investing in a service by reorganising it into invisibility, but the people who pay the cost are those who deserve the best of specialist professional help.So I am certainly sad at the disappearance of the old AB, because it is symbolic of something having been lost that is much more important than stones and mortar.Professor Angus Mackay OBE FRCPsych, ArdrishaigSir,Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns over whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But though customers# usage of data more than doubled, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m also proud of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.We#ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland Director, Alexander Graham Bell House, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 8 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is ridiculous. I have attended  years of meetings on the A and all we get is fobbed off with pathetic excuses.We need a government which will deliver results, not spend all its time plotting to get independence while ignoring the real issues like a closed A which blight people#s lives.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,As we move into  and parents, teachers and pupils once again find themselves facing additional challenges to deliver and attain a full and rounded education, it is worthwhile remembering the role that music can and should play in improving our lives.Firstly, music will help to support and sustain our young people through the coming months. For children and adults alike, the creative arts play a vital role in promoting wellbeing and positive mental health, providing both a means of expression during the isolation of #lockdown# and a practical as well as enjoyable pastime.Secondly # and just as importantly # playing an instrument is complementary to academic subjects and has been shown emphatically to improve wider educational success. As we consider the often daunting challenge of theto home schooling, those parents whose children can mix domestic timetables with musical lessons will understand the release and stimulation playing an instrument can deliver.Across society music is integral to our identities and is made to be shared. We now have the means to do that successfully and safely with online tools whose use has been well-honed by recent experience.So whether you#re at the start of a musical journey, or are well advanced in music-making let#s keep singing, keep dancing and keep music lessons flowing, particularly while the restrictions necessitated by the pandemic keep us apart in our own homes.Dr Kenneth Taylor, head teacher, St Mary’s Music School, EdinburghSir,As Scotland faces a second national lockdown, the country#s national walking charity, Paths for All, is encouraging the public to explore local walking routes in a bid to help combat social isolation, anxiety and loneliness while maintaining physical health.The call follows the launch of the charity#s Walk Once a Day this Winter campaign, which asks people to make the pledge of walking every day throughout January.The campaign includes an online hub which outlines the importance of walking and regular physical activity during the winter months. A iety of activities and ideas, designed to motivate iniduals of all ages, are available on the hub with podcast recommendations, creative walking advice and prize incentives.In what is traditionally the time of year which sees a surge of gym memberships and fitness plans we suggest taking up walking instead as part of our new year resolutions.With walking being one of the few essential reasons for leaving your home, it is the perfect exercise and now is the time to get into a walking exercise routine which is consistent with the current government guidelines. Walking can help with our social health as the guidelines allow us to meet with one person from one other household outside.Last year we saw an increase in Scots taking up walking during the first lockdown and the outcome has highlighted just how many benefits are attributed to walking and how outdoor exercise as many times a day as we can has become an important way to look after physical and mental wellbeing.Follow the campaign over on Paths for All social media channels #WalkOnceADay.For more information on the Walk Once a Day this Winter campaign, visit the Paths for All website.Ian Findlay CBE, chief officer, Paths for AllSir,The New Year is usually a time for a fresh start – making resolutions, getting fit, setting new challenges and goals. But with the continuing uncertainty caused by the COVID- pandemic, it seems harder to commit to making a change.With restrictions ongoing, it’s becoming even more important for us to find new and innovative ways to raise vital funds for NSPCC Scotland to help children at risk of abuse and neglect.Children have been greatly affected by the pandemic. Since the first lockdown measures were introduced, the average monthly number of referrals from the NSPCC’s helpline to agencies in Scotland, such as the police or children’s services, have been more than  per cent higher than the first three months of . And the effects are far from over.Even with social distancing, there are still many ways you can fundraise for us.From hosting a virtual quiz or coffee morning to selling handmade crafts, cakes or old clothes, we’ve got lots of great virtual fundraising ideas you can try while following the Scottish Government#s advice on social distancing.By volunteering just a couple of hours each month to fundraise in your  area, you can help to make  a better year for children.So please think about using your new year passion and enthusiasm to come up with some ideas to fundraise and help us be there when children need us most.To find out more or to request your fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk or contact jen.lindsay@nspcc.org.uk by email.Jen Lindsay, community fundraising manager, NSPCC Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"boaters urged to abide by covid rules","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The revised guidance recognises that travel is severely restricted by law and owners may only travel to their boatit is kept in the same local authority area they live in.RYA Scotland, Sail Scotland and British Marine Scotland have joined together to encourage boat owners to use the services of staff where their boat is stored,at all possible, in an effort to avoid making a journey, to respect that storage providers may not be able to open and to advise owners to contact providers before travelling to confirm access.The information is tailored towards RYA affiliated clubs and recognised training centres as well as inidual members and the wider boating community across Scotland.James Allan, chief executive officer at RYA Scotland, said: #Lockdown will be disappointing for everyone, but it is still possible to go boating as a form of exercise and spending some time afloat or near the water is great for our wellbeing. It is important to remember we are in the grip of a pandemic that has become signicantly worse in recent weeks. The overriding message for Scotland’s boating community is to stay at home wherever possible as we must all help stop the spread of the virus.#Importantly in this lockdown, owners may travel within their local authority to undertake essential maintenance on their boat but may not stay longer than theof time required to undertake essential maintenance.To check what level of measures apply in your area or venue where you intend to participate in activity, please check the postcode on the Scottish Government webpage.In the meantime, RYA Scotland has decided to postpone its directly organised, non-virtual events and training in response to these measures to protect participants, volunteers and others and to reduce the risk of placing an additional burden on the emergency services at what is a hugely testing time.The RYA will be providing a range of online events and #SailFromHome activities.

In the end he agreed a deal that the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation described as #desperately poor# and #the worst of both worlds#.Fishermen are restricted to catch fewer fish in most key species. Lorries carrying stocks that have been caught were left to sit at Larkhall – unable to penetrate the new fog of bureaucracy. Scottish fishermen are forced to land the fish they can catch in Denmark, which is grim news for Scottish fish processors.Instead of trying to fix the problem, Tory Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg says the fish are happier to be British. Of course they are # the fishermen aren’t catching them.The Tories must sort out this mess they have created. Our fishermen and fish processing workers deserve better than silly remarks about happy fish.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,In order to avoid fishermen being adversely impacted by export delays, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross has called on the UK Government to bring forward compensation to the affected fishermen and deliver it immediately.The SNP government must also accept responsibility and deal with ongoing issues involving their agency, Food Standards Scotland, which are holding up exports within Scotland.Both of Scotland’s governments must work together to deliver for Scottish fishermen.We in the Scottish Conservatives will back Scotland’s fishing communities all the way.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,The Scottish SPCA is appealing to animal lovers in Scotland to donate much-needed food to its National Wildle Rescue Centre in Fishcross, Alloa.Scotland#s animal welfare charity had its busiest ever year in  with over , wildle casualties admitted.The pandemic caused quite a signicant drop in the number of animals arriving at the wildle hospital. Over , wild animals were brought to the centre in .As we are entering fox cub season, we are appealing for Pedigree puppy food and puppy milk.Last year, we cared for  foxes, of which  were cubs. It can be a struggle to keep up with so many hungry mouths to feed.We expect to be even busier with admissions this year so we need help from members of the public.If anyone can help with food for these young mammals, we would appreciate anything that people can spare.Puppy meat can be purchased from the wildle centre#s Amazon wishlist http:amzn.to xkUe.Steven Gray Scottish SPCA National Wildle Rescue Centre managerSir,New Year resolutions can be a good starting point for making longer term health and lestyle improvements, but most people do not stick to them. Reasons for quitting include a lack of time, a lack of support from other people and feeling daunted by unrealistic targets.Often, goals are unachievable because they are too dficult, or they do not allow enough time for you to make gradual changes.There is nothing wrong with aiming high and being ambitious, but it is important that your goal is not too dficult or time-consuming as this could leave you feeling daunted.Ask yourself the following questions: Is the goal too ambitious  Is the timeframe realistic  What specic changes do I need to make  Can I fit my new healthy behaviour around my other commitments Breaking large goals down into smaller goals can make them feel more achievable and less daunting.For example,you are aiming to lose weight, the NHS recommends that you aim to lose around  to lbsa week. You should be able to achieve this by cutting down your calorie intake by about  to  calories each day. It might take longer than planned to lose the weight, but you are more likely to stick to it and not give up.Plan how you will achieve your goal and what changes you will make to ensure you stick to it. There are online resources available to help you plan your healthy activities, such as the NHS couch to km programme or the NHS programmes for stopping smoking, cutting down alcohol and losing weight.Try to be patient and don’t expect the results from just one or two weeks of dieting to show on the weighing scales, as it may take longer.A good way to motivate you is to involve other people. If you know someone who has a similar goal to yours, try to involve them as a #buddy# to provide mutual support.They may even be able to push you a little bit harder, helping you to achieve your goals sooner. Look for groups on social media who share your goal.If you miss a fitness session or have an alcoholic drink, cigarette or bar of chocolate, try not to feel guilty. Think about what might have triggered the deviation from your goal and try to avoid it in future. Forgive yourself and aim to get back to achieving your goal as soon as possible.On average, it takes between  and  days for something to become a long-term habit. Make goals that you want to be able to stick to long term, such as improving your overall fitness, stopping smoking or maintaining your weight.If you can make it through these first few weeks, you will notice that things will become much easier.Dr Helen Flaherty, head of health promotion and education, Heart Research UK"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 22 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We can set up a chat within  hours and the service can be used as many times as needed.James Adams, director, Royal National Institute of Blind People Scotland, EdinburghDear Alister,In the weeks since the UK left the European Union, I have been contacted by numerous Argyll and Bute residents and businesses who share my very deep concerns about the future sustainability and, indeed, the survival of our vital shellfish and fishing sector.The seafood sector is a vital component of our already-fragile regional economy and is now hit by the inability, virtually overnight, for producers and processors to get their time-sensitive products to market or to customers.If allowed to go unresolved, this sector is likely to disappear, badly affecting Argyll and Bute’s overall recovery and future growth.Fish and shellfish from Argyll and Bute are high quality products of international renown.The industry has been a mainstay and a major employer in the area for many decades, sustaining not only the local economy but making a signicant contribution to the Scottish and UK economies.I am now hearing from long-standing fishing families, newer start-up businesses and companies employing hundreds of people that,urgent action is not taken, they will have to close their doors for good.This would be devastating for Argyll and Bute, where the sector comprises many single-family operated vessels, smaller fleets and artisan producers as well as some medium to larger enterprises.As a council we are doing all that we can to support these businesses and prevent this imminent disaster.Our officers are working behind the scenes to assist and are in constant discussions with the Scottish Government to reiterate the critical need for the commercial hubs to operate smoothly, ensuring that the right processes are in place to help businesses get their goods to their customers.We are also speaking to Argyll and Bute producers to help them navigate these new processes and to issue all the necessary paperwork where appropriate, so that these valuable products reach buyers.Delays on both sides of the border have already seen valuable products being lost, together with valued customers who are seeking their produce where.Very urgent action and assistance is needed now from your government in order to prevent this traditional Scottish industry sector from disappearing altogether.Most urgently of all, getting products to market must be streamlined, simplied and speeded up.These products need to be prioritised over products with longer shelf lives –the situation is allowed to persist then very many companies will have no choice but to give up, costing jobs and much-needed revenue to the treasury.In addition to improving processes and the speed of delivery here in the UK, these businesses, so vital to Argyll and Bute and Scotland’s economic recovery and future success, need your government to negotiate urgently with its counterparts in Europe to identy and resolve the delays in allowing fresh goods to arrive in and then to progress on to customers.I cannot state strongly enough that these actions are needed now. More is required, though, in the medium and longer terms, to help this beleaguered industry to get afloat again and regain some buoyancy.Producers and customers need reassurance that future supplies will be prioritised and to regain confidence in the industry through dedicated marketing and investment where possible through the £m fisheries fund your government announced following the publication of the agreement.Our seafood sector desperately needs Government to take action to secure its survival. Please do what you can, urgently, to avoid its demise.Robin Currie, Argyll and Bute Council leader"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 29 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Thatrsquos because it helps build up your immune system. Vitamin C is thought to increase the production of white blood cells. These are key to fighting infections.Popular citrus fruits include grapefruit, oranges, tangerines, lemons, limesand clementines.ZincldquoZinc is necessary for a healthy immune system,\" according toMelissa Snover, founder and CEO of Nourished.\"A lack of zinc can make a person more susceptible to disease and illness.\"This essential nutrient helps maintain the bodyrsquos ability to make new cells and enzymes, process carbohydrate, fat and protein in food and also increases the speed of healing muscles and wounds.\"Foods high in zinc include red meat, shellfish, eggs, nuts, wholegrainsand legumes, such as chickpeas, lentilsand beans.BroccoliBroccoli is supercharged with vitamins and minerals. Packed with vitamins A, C, and E, as well as many other antioxidants and fibre, broccoli is one of the healthiest vegetables you can put on your table. The key to keeping its power intact is to cook it as little as possible - or better yet, not at all.GingerGinger is another ingredient many turn to when they are feeling under the weather. The antioxidant is believed to fight off cold and flu symptoms, combat nausea, and is full of iron, zinc, calcium and magnesium.However, itrsquos worth noting that a study from  showed fresh ginger may help boost the bodyrsquos respiratory system, but dry ginger did not show the same results.GarlicBefore it became a staple in cooking, garlic was actually used for medicinal purposes. From manganese to vitamin B and C, as well as selenium and fibre, it is high in immune-boosting compounds.\"Garlic is a potent anti-viral, anti-fungal agent, and eating it raw, or as an uncooked puree alongside your normal foodwill wipe-out most miscreants,\" Sara Davenport, health expert and author of Reboot Your Health told the .YogurtLook for yogurts that have live and active cultures printed on the label, like Greek yogurt. These cultures may stimulate your immune system to help fight diseases.According to Healthline, yogurt can also be a great source of vitamin D, so try to select brands fortied with vitamin D. Vitamin D helps regulate the immune system and is thought to boost our bodyrsquos natural defences against diseases.Sunflower seedsSunflower seeds are full of nutrients, including phosphorus, magnesium, and vitamin B. Theyrsquore also incredibly high in vitamin E, a powerful antioxidant.Vitamin E is important in regulating and maintaining immune system . Other foods with high amounts of vitamin E include avocadosand dark leafy greens.Mushrooms\"There are approximately  species of fungi that have been identied with medicinal properties, and many have antiviral, antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory qualities,\" says Euan MacLennan, herbal director at Pukka Herbs and medical herbalist at an NHS practice in London.\"Mushrooms are high in beta glucans ndash natural substances found to help prime our immune system, making sure itrsquos ready for action to fight off infection.\"Red peppersAccording to Healthline, red peppers contain twice as much vitamin C as citrus. Theyrsquore also a rich source of beta carotene. Besides boosting your immune system, vitamin C may help maintain healthy skin. Beta carotene helps keep your eyes and skin healthy.Fermented foodsldquoIf you like saurkraut, miso, kefir and their immune-boosting relatives, add just a spoonful or two each day to your diet, says Sara Davenport.ldquoFermented foods encourage the growth of good bacteria in your gut and when their levels are high, so are your immune levels, defending you from viral infections."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-man-ordered-80-hours-unpaid-work","story":"WHEN police officers visited a womans house in Galashiels while enforcing a warrant, they discovered a -year-old man in the premises.But Andrew Atkinson was already the subject of a non-harassment order not to contact the woman and was subsequently arrested.Depute fiscal Ross Price told Selkirk Sherf Court the police had visited the house in connection with an unrelated matter at around .pm on December .They discovered Atkinson and also his partner who he was banned from contacting.The court heard that the partner had asked for the non-harassment order to be revoked.Atkinson, who gave an alternative address in Galashiels, was sentenced to  hours of unpaid work for breaching the order.Sherf Kenneth McGowan agreed with a request from defence lawyer Mat Patrick to revoke the non-harassment order."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-vaccine-passport","story":"A Covid- vaccine passport system may soon be introduced in Scotland.Jason Leitch, the countrys national clinical director, said the passports are an \"interesting concept\".But what are the passports, and how would they work in Scotland What is a vaccine passport A vaccine passport is an internationally recognised travel pass which would prove whether or not people have had a Covid vaccine.It could,implemented, allow people to prove their status and potentially travel abroad.It is being pushed forward by former prime minister Tony Blair, who told Boris Johnson thatBritain should use itspresidency of the G to launch theldquointernational Covid Pass.What would a vaccine passport look like It is far too early to say, however Mr Blair says he believes the passport scheme should consist of a single, standardised digital system. He says it should be capable of tracking and verying an iniduals vaccine status across the world.It could, according to Blair, involve not only how many vaccinations someone has had , but also any test results they may have had in the past.It is hoped that the data would be transferred using a QR code, which would be scanned by participating countries at borders and ports.Will vaccine passports be introduced in Scotland In evidence to the Scottish Parliamentrsquos Covid- Committee on Thursday, Professor Leitch said coronavirus is likely to be present in some sort of ldquoendemic form for years to come.When he was asked about vaccine passports, hesaid: ldquoI agree it is an interesting concept, the WHOhave begun to look at it.He stressed the latest scientic evidence suggests vaccination is not a ldquobinary state, but there is precedent for travel restrictions based on vaccination ndash including yellow fever certicates.Prof Leitch said: ldquoI think we will probably move towards that.

T-shirts and medals will be posted out to participants on completion.Gail said: #It is fully the committee’s intention to host a live event, but we acknowledge thatthis is not possible then a virtual race is the best alternative, after the cancellation of the  event.

After this amazing gig, we find his character outside the jazz club, downcast and not feeling any dferent. His friend says: #You’re like a fish who’s looking for the ocean only to discover that the water you’re in is the ocean.#He missed the joy of the day-to-day experiences, thinking the big dream would make everything better. What a lesson. We can chase the dream only to miss the journey.Le in front of us is to be grasped and appreciated daily. As King Solomon said all those centuries ago: #It is good for people to eat, drink, and enjoy their work under the sun during the short le God has given them, and to accept their lot in le.# Ecclesiastes :. reminded us to appreciate the people and the things around us a whole lot more.Dreaming and aspiring for better days is not wrong but let us not miss today while waiting for change.Today # this day # is to be lived and enjoyed.

I was brought up in Princes Street and it was the first time I had been out the Wee Toon. I was only  or  so it was strange to me.I loved the folks on the island who made us so welcome. Once I qualied, I went around a bit, to Africa, west and east, and the West Indies, but Jura was better than anywhere I went. I hope the people of Jura see this.Leslie McArthur, Carluke, South Lanarkshire.I have contacted our roads department about the icy and, at times, ungritted pavements in my council ward.Many of my justiably concerned constituents have been in regular contact with me on this matter.With all that is going on, whether it#s the latest lockdown or a decreasing local authority budget, our hard-working roads workers are thinly stretched and do not have an easy task. However, when it comes to our pavements and roads, safety must always come first.Our pavements must be safe to walk on all year round.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands.The Scottish Government spin machine’s use of phrases last week like #encouraging progress# about the works at the Rest and Be Thankful cannot disguise its failure to make any real progress towards a solution.At an online briefing session last month, I questioned Transport Minister Michael Matheson on why it says it could take at least five years before it even starts work on a proper solution.He waffled on about planning permission, environmental impact assessments and compensating landowners. This is ridiculous. I’ve attended  years of meetings on the A and all we get is fobbed off with pathetic excuses.We need a government which will delivers results, not spends all its time plotting to get independence while ignoring the real issues like a closed A which blight people’s lives.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal.The new year is usually a time for a fresh start – making resolutions, getting fit, setting new challenges and goals. But with the continuing uncertainty caused by the Covid- pandemic, it seems harder to commit to making a change.With restrictions ongoing, it’s becoming even more important for us to find new and innovative ways to raise vital funds for NSPCC Scotland to help children at risk of abuse and neglect.Children have been greatly affected by the pandemic. Since the first lockdown measures were introduced, the average monthly number of referrals from the NSPCC’s helpline to agencies in Scotland, such as the police or children’s services, have been more than  per cent higher than the first three months of . And the effects are far from over.Even with social distancing, there are still many ways you can fundraise for us. From hosting a virtual quiz or coffee morning to selling handmade crafts, cakes or old clothes, we’ve got lots of great virtual fundraising ideas you can try while following the Scottish Government’s advice on social distancing.By volunteering just a couple of hours each month, fundraising in your local area, you can help make  a better year for children.So please think about using your new year passion and enthusiasm to come up with some ideas to fundraise and help us be there when children need us most.To find out more or to request your fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk support-us events-fundraising new-year-challenge or email jen.lindsay@nspcc.org,ukJen Lindsay, community fundraising manager for NSPCC Scotland.A new survey by the Stroke Association shows that  per cent of people in Scotland don’t know that high blood pressure is the biggest risk factor for stroke, one of the leading causes of death and disability in Scotland.This is really worrying because . per cent of people in Scotland have high blood pressure.Smoking, drinking alcohol, being physically inactive and sitting for long periods, can contribute to high blood pressure, diabetes, and being an unhealthy weight, all of which increase your risk of stroke.You can start to reduce your risk of stroke by making small changes to your lestyle.To launch the first ever national Stroke Prevention Day on January , we’ve worked with our partners at the Rotary Club, LoSalt and OMRON Healthcare to help you make #OneSmallChange to reduce your risk of stroke.It’s often easiest to start off small and pick something that’s achievable for you.This may be swapping your after-work alcoholic drink for a soft one, getting up and moving regularly during the day, cutting down on salt or sugar, or joining an online exercise group.Just go to our website www.stroke.org.uk PreventionDay and receive tailored advice plus monthly emails with hints and tips.We would like you to pledge to make the change for three months, then let us know how you get on and how you found ways of sticking to your pledge.The things you tell us will help others across the UK to reduce their risk of stroke and lead a healthier lestyle in .Juliet Bouverie, chief executive, The Stroke Association. "},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week january 15 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It is stating the obvious, I know, but as we live through another lockdown, it is tempting to focus on the liberties lost and freedoms curtailed, when there are many good things still to celebrate.Not least of these is hope, another word that is used a lot in these days.

The problem is, Smithy, a teacher#s nightmare, causes so much chaos that the head teacher ends up on a le support machine.Enter Dr Hannibal Lecture, the replacement head, and the stage is set for a war of nerves. The musical is on next Thursday, Friday and Saturday, with the curtain going up at .pm.West Coast Motors will be extending its local town service to include the school on the three nights of the production.FIFTY YEARS AGOPaul abroadWhile the financial problems of the Beatles are being investigated in London, Paul McCartney is believed to be in America. He left his farm, High Park, on January , after celebrating the New Year there with his we and children.Visit on # but support is neededConfirmation has been received from the mayor of the French village of Montbeliard that a party of Campbeltonians will be welcome at the village#s music festival on July - this year.Provost Dan McKinven told the Courier: #I now propose to call a meeting within the Town Council Chambers of all interested in taking part. I would expect representation from pipers, Highland and Scottish country dancers, choirs and pop groups. Any inidual performer would also be welcome as a cross-section of our community and its talent is essential.#The present plan is to travel directly from Campbeltown to Montbeliard by luxury coach. The village is about km from the Swiss border and the city of Basel.Provost McKinven added: #We would expect to form a committee which would be responsible for organising the finance and travel arrangements for about  people inclusive of press, photographer and artists.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOTwo boys birchedAt a children#s court last Friday – Sherf McMaster Campbell on the bench – two boys were charged with the theft of purses containing money from a house in Burn Road. The crime was admitted.The boys, it appeared, were messengers, and the younger one was in the habit of calling at the house in this capacity daily. The purses were taken on separate days. On the first occasion a purse containing £ s d had been left lying on a small table near the window of one of the rooms. The window was probably partially open. After the younger boy#s visit in the afternoon it was missed.Next day a purse containing s d was left in the same position, and on the boy calling at the house, the occupier challenged him with the theft. He admitted taking the purse and handed it over to the owner. Only  shillings of the  shillings and sixpence remained in the purse.While this interview was going on at the back door of the residence, the older boy, who accompanied the other on the second occasion, appeared to have devoted his attention to the room where the first purse was got, and he possessed himself of the second purse and its contents. His lordship sentenced each of the culprits to receive seven strokes with the birch rod."},{"url":null,"title":"letters january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I see Loch Fyne langoustines are sent to the EU but, living fairly close to Loch Fyne, I don#t seem to be able to purchase the product locally.I am sure UK supermarkets would be only too happy to sell, crabs, lobsters and langoustines provided by Scottish fishermen but it seems they would prefer to supply the EU rather than the home market.Fishing boats enter Campbeltown Loch regularly but there is no local supply of their catch as this is transported #up the road# as soon as it is landed.I just suggest that supplying the UK market is maybe a way out of the continual problems with our #friendly# neighbours who seem hell bent on putting continual obstacles in the way of sensible trading partnerships.Keith Abendroth, Campbeltown.I grew up in Peninver and have been hiking on the hills around the Rest and Be Thankful many times, all year round. My initial thought a few years ago was that the best solution to the problem of landslides on the Rest was building avalanche tunnels like there are on the A at Lochcarron but there is practically zero ground to build on on the downhill side of the A.The big catch-pits along the uphill side of the road do seem to work but, in the long-term, removing the unstable soil and planting lots of trees and shrubs on the rest of the hillside to hold it in place, might be the best solution.Rather than replace the road through the Rest and Be Thankful with a new route through another glen or to continue trying to stop an unstable hillside from obeying the laws of gravity, how much would it cost to remove all the soil in these watercourses which regularly slide Maybe cost-wise removing the unstable soil from the Rest would be cheaper # and quicker  # than building a whole new road If there is a landslide in a watercourse, it weakens the soil directly above it so that will slide next, followed by the soil above it, etc. The bedrock at the Rest is only a couple of feet below the surface so removing the soil in gullies liable to slide after rain might be a lot cheaper than building a new road through another glen.For a permanent solution, perhaps close off the road from Ardgartan to the Lochgoilhead junction for six months in the winter, pipe water from Loch Restil to the top of the gullies prone to sliding # at the base of the first exposed bedrock high up the gullies # let the water run for three or four months, and hydraulically remove all the loose soil, then in the spring shovel all the accumulated debris of the other side of the road It would mean short-term inconvenience for a lot of people but it might save a lot of money, time, and perhaps lives, in the long-term.Harry Hood, New Hampshire, USA. As children and young peopleto being home-schooled due to the new lockdown, there is no doubt that this will have a continued detrimental impact on mental health and wellbeing.As a coalition, we applaud the Scottish Government’s greater investment in mental health services. However, a view we share with other organisations, is that this investment is simply not sufficient.Mental health services were already under immense strain prior to Covid-, with children waiting considerable s of time for support. Recent statistics from December, for example, point to the fact that more than , children have been waiting over a year for treatment.This pandemic will only serve to make matters even worse as services deal with a backlog of those already suffering from mental health problems, added to which will be those who have developed problems over the course of lockdown.What is needed is a national crusade, delivering signicant investment in the public, private and third sectors to deliver adequate mental health support, both during and as we recover from Covid-. We must also use this as an opportunity to radically transform our mental health services, both for now and for the future, refocusing on prevention and early intervention.In the meantime, we would urge those children and their families who feel they need help not to hold back and look to get the support they need.The Scottish Children’s Services Coalition: Kenny Graham, Falkland House School Lynn Bell, LOVE Learning Stephen McGhee, Spark of Genius Niall Kelly, Young Foundations.The serious neurological condition Myalgic Encephalomylitiswill sadly be all too familiar to some of your readers at least , children and adults in Scotland live with ME, also diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome .Many face barriers in accessing health and social care services that meet their needs, and some professionals still don’t understand the impact of ME and its symptoms.UK charity Action for ME is trying to change this by offering people with ME across Scotland one-to-one advocacy, via phone and email, to help them be heard, understand their rights and access support.We want to expand this much-needed service, and are seeking enthusiastic volunteers in Scotland who can make the most of our online advocate training programme to develop their skills, gain valuable experience, and help improve the lives of vulnerable people with ME, all from home.Anyone who is interested in finding out more can call , emailor visit our website– we would love to hear from good listeners who can spare two hours a week.Alice Cranston, advocacy coordinator, Action for ME."},{"url":null,"title":"mark beaumont goes the extra mile for marys meals","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It’s a fantastic way to get more active and also help feed hungry children in the world’s poorest communities.#Funds raised will allow Mary’s Meals to provide hungry children in some of the world’s poorest areas with a nutritious daily meal. The promise of food attracts impoverished children to the classroom, where they can gain an education that will one day hopefully be their ladder out of poverty.And thanks to Double the Love, donations made will go twice as far. Give until January , and the UK government with match public donations to the charity, up to £ million.Gillian McMahon, director of supporter engagement at Mary’s Meals, said: #Whether it’s doing your regular run, getting on your bike or upping your daily step count, we hope that lots of people will get moving and take part in Miles For Mary’s Meals.#Those taking part in Miles For Mary’s Meals are asked to ensure that they participate in their chosen exercise challenge safely and in line with Covid- restrictions in their local area.To find out more about organising your own Miles For Mary’s Meals fundraiser, visit marysmeals.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I’m anticipating an end to the pandemic – coming out of the gloom. And there have been many episodes in le in which I’ve lived in the hope of emerging through the other side of the dark night. I thank God for the hope he gives me. But, how do we know when the darkness of night has ended In a rabbinic school, a very old rabbi posed a clever question to his young students: #When can it be said that night truly ends and the day begins  When is that moment when from darkness there comes light, when it can really be said the gloom has passed and brightness is here #The first student, still a bit immature, replied: #Well, it’s when it says so on the internet.#The rabbi smiled and told him: #That’s not what I mean.#The next student said: #It’s when you can distinguish sheep from goats, because in the dark they look very similar, but when light appears they can be told apart.#The rabbi told him it was a wiser answer, but not the one.The third student said: #When you can tell the fig tree and palm tree apart.#This interested the rabbi, but, no, this wasn’t it. The rabbi askedthere were any other ideas, but there weren’t. So he told them the answer: #It is when you look at another person and do not see a stranger but a brother or sister this is when know the night has ended and the day begins.#Father Tony Wood, Saint Kieran#s Catholic Church, Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +viaYOURTWITTERNAMEHERE\" title\"Tweet this\"TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

After nearly a year of people taking exercise and essential journeys on foot during Covid- lockdowns, plans to keep the nation walking are more important than ever.#The increases in people walking, has highlighted the lack of good infrastructure to support safe and enjoyable travel by foot. Communities that lack local facilities within walking distance have had challenges. That’s why we are calling for investment in everyday walking to build back better after the pandemic, and respond to the challenges of air pollution, climate change and Scotland#s health record.#Ian Findlay CBE, chief officer of Paths for All, said: #We launch our manesto at a crucial point of change for Scotland as we begin to plan for le after Covid-. During lockdown, we have seen a rise in the number of people walking as many used it as a way to cope with the pressures of everyday le, to reach essential shops and services in their  area, and to connect with others and nature in a safe way.#But we need to do more to make regular walking an enjoyable and accessible choice for everyone in Scotland, from all walks of le. By investing in walking programmes and safe, attractive places to walk we can signicantly improve the nation’s health, reducing health inequalities and pressure on our NHS.#Brendan Paddy, director of Ramblers Scotland, said: #Our joint manesto makes a compelling case for investment to make walking safe and attractive for everyone in Scotland.#We believe walking can play a vital role in Scotland’s response to the challenges of Covid- and climate change # and the obesity, bioersity and mental health crises we face.

The news was welcomed by the prospective Conservative candidate for Argyll and Bute, Mr Ralph Leishman.He told the Courier: ‘This is a definite step forward and knocks on the head suggestions that the Scottish Office is totally opposed to CalMac as the operator on this route.’Scottish Office reservations are believed to centre on proposals to use the MV Claymore on the route. This would mean £, would have to be spent upgrading another vessel for relief work for its west coast services.They are also said to be concerned that no private firm appeared to be interested in running the service all year-round.CalMac’s participation in the project has been backed by politicians on both sides of the Irish Sea.Both Scottish Secretary Mr Michael Forsyth and Prime Minister Mr John Major were believed this week to have been lobbied at Westminster by CalMac’s supporters.Northern Ireland secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew is said to be among those who have contacted Mr Forsyth to support CalMac’s involvement.The project supporters have been asking the Scottish Office to consider the economic benefits the ferry could bring to Ballycastle and Campbeltown, which are both areas of high unemployment. The project is expected to create around  jobs,  of them in Argyll.The only other company which has expressed an interest in running the service, Seacat, only wants to operate it over a four-month summer season.FIFTY YEARS AGOMr Noble ill # so Provost steps in to open new airport terminalThe new passenger terminal at Machrihanish Airport will be opened on Friday at pm by Provost Dan McKinven, in the absence of Mr Michael Noble MP Minister of Trade, through illness.The new building, which has been provided by the Department of Trade and Industry in conjunction with the Ministry of Defence, is a small one situated within a self-contained enclave and is designed to improve the facilities of BEA passengers using Machrihanish.Before the terminal was built, all BEA passengers had to be taken by bus between the aircraft and the old terminal building near the main entrance of the airport, and, latterly, to a dispersal point on the south side.Under the new improvements, BEA aircraft will now taxi directly to the new terminal area, and passengers will be able to walk the short distance from the aircraft to the terminal.A new road traffic control system has also been provided because aircraft taxiing from the runway to the terminal have to cross a public road.The new arrangements have the additional advantage of reducing the distance, and, consequently, the journey time between the airport and Campbeltown.A complete shake-up of BEA Highland services is on the way. It could mean higher fares and smaller planes and the end of the name British European Airways on some routes.Last year the Highlands and Islands routes cost the company more than £,.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and FlashesThe annual meeting in connection with the Campbeltown Cottage Hospital will be held on Tuesday first at . in the Council Room.Local footballers had again an idle Saturday last week on account of bad weather.

His solution is even more batty.Driven by resentment and sepia-tinted post-Empire English nationalism, cloaked in talk of Britain and the UK, the Tories have jemmied the UK out of the world’s largest and most successful single market.Having placed the UK as a #third country# outside the EU, alongside Somalia and Kazakhstan, it is not the EU to blame for the barriers to free trade, Mr Abendroth, but the UK government and those who parroted the cruel myths of Brexiteer #sunny uplands#.Mr Abendroth suggests that the fishing industry merely sells into the domestic market as a replacement to EU trade, without thought to the timescales required to repurpose supply lines and create a viable home market # evenit could be done fishing businesses would already be bankrupt.Scotland’s economy and the living standards and opportunities of Scots have been thrown under the wheels of England’s red Brexit bus. Never have the consequences of permitting Westminster to rule our country been more stark.But the time is coming when Scotland will have the historic opportunity to regain the huge benefits of EU membership and become a normal, thriving, independent state at the heart of Europe. There is an empty seat at the top table in Europe # and it won’t be empty for long.Ron Wilson, secretary, Kintyre SNP.Remember the closing stages of the Brexit negotiations  Boris Johnson pretended he was holding out to get the best deal for fishermen. In the end he agreed a deal that the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation described as #desperately poor# and #the worst of both worlds#.Fishermen are restricted to catch fewer fish in most key species. Lorries carrying stocks that have been caught were left to sit at Larkhall – unable to penetrate the new fog of bureaucracy. Scottish fishermen are forced to land the fish they can catch in Denmark – grim news for Scottish fish processors.Instead of trying to fix the problem, Tory Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg says the fish are happier to be British. Of course they are – the fishermen aren’t catching them.The Tories must sort out this mess they have created. Our fishermen and fish processing workers deserve better than silly remarks about happy fish.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal ward.Keith Abendroth is spot on with his call for the fishing industry in Campbeltown to supply the home market.During my three-and-a-half years in the town it was possible to buy directly from the boat on occasion but it was nigh on impossible to buy fresh live lobster in the town#s fish shop.When I was new to the town , I experienced some shocking service at the some of the small retailers who I always endeavour to support. It is easier to get a full range of seafood and fish in Peebles, about  miles from the sea, which has an excellent fish shop supplied from Eyemouth on the East Coast.Much Welsh shellfish is sent by air to Europe. I often wondered why lorries trundled from Campbeltown across the Rest and Be Thankful and all the way to the English Channel crossings.Much of the st century supply chain is a mystery to me. For instance, much Pacic wild salmon is processed in China before being exported to the UK.  It is an excellent alternative to the farmed version at roughly the same price.Surely a town with an airport could develop a sea product freight service or is it simply down to volume, weight and cost Mark Davey, Peebles.Two weeks ago, at Campbeltown Free Church, we received a letter of thanks from Blythswood Care for filling shoeboxes to support the  Shoe Box Appeal.However, we are aware that many who contributed do not belong to Campbeltown Free Church.So, through the pages of the Courier, can I thank them for their kindness towards people they have never met but whose lives have been enriched by their generosity Dr Rodger M Crooks, Campbeltown Free Church minister.Like many, many other residents in Argyll and Bute I have received through the post a bizarre leaflet from the Liberal Democrats. Bizarre, because it promotes a candidate standing in a completely dferent seat # Caithness, Sutherland and Ross.Meanwhile, the good folk of Caithness, Sutherland and Ross have been equally mystied as to why the hapless Lib Dems have sent them leaflets promoting a candidate in Argyll and Bute!The Lib Dems have certainly lost their way when it comes to their policy on the EU # but it seems that they#ve lost their way in Scotland too.Les Wilson, Islay.Earlier this month the Prime Minister announced a third national lockdown. Although necessary, these measures mean many of our veterans will be facing the next several weeks – or months – completely alone.And while the vaccine rollout out across the country provides some hope, social isolation and loneliness poses a real threat to our elderly this winter, among them many former RAF personnel and their partners supported by the fund.To help combat this, last year the RAF Benevolent Fund introduced a weekly Check and Chat service to support members of the RAF Family experiencing loneliness. I speak to one such gentleman every Tuesday. He lives alone and spent much of  totally isolated and, for him, this service truly is a leline. We chat about what he’s been up to, what he’s cooking for tea, to his time in the RAF and often I’m the only person he will speak to for days.The fund also organises weekly telephone friendship groups, provides access to a listening and counselling service, relationship counselling support, and an online wellbeing portal to help support emotional wellbeing amongst the veteran community.Throughout the pandemic, many of us have learnt more about our neighbours and local community. That’s why we are calling on the people of Scotland to consider whether they know any RAF veterans, or their spouses or widows, who may be experiencing loneliness.To refer someone to the RAF Benevolent Fund, please visit rafbf.org or call   .Air Vice-Marshal Chris Elliot, chief executive, RAF Benevolent Fund."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 29 2021","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

He will work with inidual police wildle liaison officers, NGOs, the Scottish Government, NatureScot, RSPB, the SSPCA and Scottish Land and Estates. The position is funded by NatureScot.PC Ross was the community police officer for Dunbar, and has  years of police service and an extensive background in wildle crime issues, community policing, problem solving and educational work.Minister for Rural Affairs and the Natural Environment Ben Macpherson MSP said: #Wildle crime is despicable and tackling it has been a long-standing priority for the Scottish Government.#We work closely with a number of agencies to ensure perpetrators are brought to justice.#The Animals and Wildle Act, which recently became law, increases the maximum penalties for the most serious wildle crimes and extends the time available to Police Scotland to investigate.#The work of the National Wildle Crime Unit is hugely valued by communities across Scotland and we are committed to supporting it. I look forward to working with PC Ross in the future and congratulate him on his new role.#PC Ross said: #When I was in Edinburgh, very early in my service, I became involved in investigating wildle crime because of my interest and experience in this area. I’ve been a part-time wildle crime officer throughout my whole service and the new job is the pinnacle of my career.#I worked very hard preparing for my interview and was very keen to secure the job, which is a dream post. I am looking forward to settling into the role and working with all the dferent partner agencies which are so important in the fight against wildle crime.#In the six weeks I’ve been in post I’ve concentrated on meeting many of the partner agencies we work with in wildle crime. Unfortunately most of the meetings have had to be done virtually, but I feel they have all been really positive and I look forward to building on these initial foundations, especially when we can meet face to face.#The head of the NWCU, Chief Inspector Hubble added: #I was extremely pleased when PC Ross was successfully appointed as our new Scottish ISO and I am sure he is going to be a valuable asset to policing wildle crime.#Andy Turner, NatureScot wildle crime officer, said: #Eliminating wildle crime is huge priority for us, which is why we’ve provided funding for this post since . Wildle crime doesn’t just cause irreparable damage to Scotland’s nature, it also affects tourism, which in turn impacts on the economy.#We are committed to working with NWCU, Police Scotland and other members of the Partnership for Action Against Wildle Crimeto tackle this challenging issue.#We worked closely with Gavin’s predecessor, Charlie Everitt, to prevent wildle crime and raise awareness. I look forward to continuing to this important work with Gavin and the NWCU in the future.#NWCU’s main role is to assist in the prevention and detection of wildle crime by obtaining and distributing information from a wide range of organisations and by helping police forces investigate wildle crimes. NWCU also produce analysis which highlights local or national threats.The appointment of PC Ross comes after the retirement of PC Charlie Everitt, who had spent the last  years developing the role of Scottish ISO within the National Wildle Crime Unit.PC Everitt furthered countless operations, provided expert advice to police wildle liaison officers and acted as the key central point of contact between the police and a vast range of partner agencies.He was well known throughout the Scottish wildle crime arena and his professional knowledge, enthusiasm, and willingness to assist were beyond question.

This adaptation means that they are ideally suited to being houseplants, particularly in homes where the owners are forgetful waterers!Succulent is a general description for plants that have tissues adapted to store water but doesnrsquot refer to a specic plant. On the other hand, cactus is a botanical name for plants belonging to the plant family Cactaceae and, for specic physiological reasons, may not always be regarded as succulents.Succulent suggestionsAmongst the toughest, most robust indoor succulents is the sanseveria, a wide range of plants whose common names include mother-in-lawrsquos tongue , snake plantand birds nest plant .With bold, thick, simple leaves, theyrsquore almost sculptural in appearance, tolerant of low light levels and, because they require minimal attention, theyrsquore an obvious choice for those with little or no experience of houseplants.Sanseveria are particularly good at improving the indoor air quality theyrsquore known to remove air pollutants including formaldehyde, xylene and toluene and, because they convert carbon dioxide to oxygen at night, theyrsquore popular bedroom plants.Another group of plants that are particularly easy to care for are the aloes, which the ancient Egyptians called lsquoimmortality plantsrsquo because they are almost indestructible.The natural healing benefits of aloe vera has made it popular for centuries and is iously credited with the ability to soothe irritated or burned skin, improve skin, hair, oral hygiene and digestion and to treat acne and arthritis.Like sanseveria, aloe requires very little care, tolerates low light levels and infrequent watering, removes air-borne pollutants and oxygenates the air at night, which aids sleep.One of our favourite succulents is the echiveria, which grows in compact rosettes of succulent, sometimes coloured leaves from which flowering stalks may grow.These plants like a reasonable amount of light, some dilute feed when actively growing and prefer under-watering to over-watering. A happy echiveria will produce little plantlets which can be removed and grown into new plants.Carefree cactusIt would be impossible to talk about easy-to-care for plants without mentioning cacti, which have well-developed survival adaptations.Most cacti have developed spines which in fact are highly modied leaves. Not only do these spines help prevent the plant being grazed, but they also reduce the airflow around the plant, which helps it conserve water.Photosynthesis takes place on the stemand its shallow, far-reaching root system enables the cactus to react quickly and absorb any water reaching the ground.Whilst the enormous tree-like cacti of the American desert may be the first cactus that springs to mind, wersquove highlighted some interesting houseplant types below that are incredibly easy to look after and certainly wonrsquot take over your home!There are many dferent shapes of cacti, including round, flat, columnar, smooth, bumpy, ribbed and fluted, and itrsquos important to note that some of these actually change shape depending on how much water is stored in the stem at the time!Not all cacti have fully developed spines. For example, the popular schlumbergera, of which the best-known culti is the Christmas-flowering cactus, has less modied leaves which look like lsquoteethrsquo along the edge of their stems. Their stems grow in lsquosegmentsrsquo and resemble flattened pads, with their flowers being produced at the end of the segments.Although the Christmas-flowering culti is most popular in the UK, there are dferent cultis which flower at dferent times of the year.In their natural habitat, schlumbergera grow on trees or in rocks and generally enjoy shady habitats with high humidity, making them an ideal choice for bathrooms.If yoursquore looking for an unusual and interesting but easy-to-care-for indoor hanging plant, you might consider the aporocactus ndash a group of tree-growing cactus that grow well in a hanging pot.For a cactus with impact, the gymnocalycium mihanovichii is a sure winner. The top part of the stem on this cactus lacks green pigmentand can be bright red, yellow or other amazing colours.So,yoursquore looking for a plant that thrives on neglect, hopefully wersquove given you some ideas!Just remember that the golden rule for cacti and succulents is to under-water rather than over-water ndash too much moisture will cause disease and rot.For more information, take a look on our website at www.merryhatton"},{"url":null,"title":"mary-contini-column-food-thought-covid","story":"To be able to buy vegetables from the likes of Crunchy Carrot in Dunbar or Phantassie in East Linton is my foodie heaven !It is probably more expensive to shop locally and, as you need to drive to dferent outlets, it does take longer.For hard-pressed working families, this is not always an option.

under the rail bridge on the townrsquos Spott Road to stop the animals from roosting there.Concerns had been raised that birds were swooping from under the bridge and startling drivers, while the animalsrsquo excrement was also creating a slip hazard on the footpath.Now, a political party and a bird control expert have called on the local authority to look again at the options available.Among those calling for a rethink is the Animal Welfare Party.Kay Hamilton, Dowager Duchess of Hamilton, is a member of AWP and said: ldquoThe birds certainly shouldnrsquot be killed.ldquoThis is ridiculous and all out of proportion.ldquoNor should the council be thinking of installing netting, as we know many birds can become trapped in netting and suffer horribly before dying.ldquoAlternative solutions have to be found.Vanessa Hudson, leader of Animal Welfare Party, described moves to kill the birds or install anti-bird netting as ldquocompletely out of step with the times.She said: ldquoItrsquos  and time for us to accept that we share our spaces with wild animals, including pigeons, and humane solutions should be pursued.ldquoIt is an offence to cause unnecessary suffering to an animal, and nets cause nesting and visiting birds the most horric distress and injury before death by hanging, starvation or dehydration.Guy Merchant, of Bird Control Consultancy Services International , told the Courier that carrying out a cull would be ldquoa waste of time and money.Similarly, he suggested that putting netting under the width of the bridge could create other problems, such as trapping live birds, which could then lead to legal issues.Mr Merchant, who previously lived in East Lothian and operates his business from Cambridgeshire, said: ldquoThe very best thing you can do is mesh above the pavement area.ldquoYou completely mesh above the pavement area so you are excluding the birds from either side but leaving the central reservation open.ldquoThat means that the cost of the netting operation is dramatically reduced and, secondly,you kick all the resident birds out from the under the bridge they are going to go to peoplersquos properties in Dunbar and cause a huge nuisance.\"Mr Merchant said that left the birds to roost and perch in the central reservation of the bridge and their droppings would fall onto the road, rather than the pavement.At a meeting of Dunbar Community Council last month, it was revealed that work under the bridge was due to take place in mid-February.East Lothian Council said that the bridge was lsquohomersquo to ldquohundreds of pigeons which are causing problems for drivers and also fouling the footpath.It was said that work could take up to five days while the underside of the bridge was cleaned and re-netted in a bid to prevent pigeons from roosting there in the future."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource

Seeds youve sown indoors are also likely to flower earlieryouve given them a head start.Which are the easiest seeds to sow Annuals are a good starting point these plants only last a year, but will give you lashings of summer colour and are great for plugging gaps in borders. They can be started off indoors from February to April, before being transplanted and then put in their final position when all risk of frost has passed.Many perennials, including hardy geranium, echinacea and sea holly, can also easily be grown from seed, although youll need more patience, as some wont flower in their first year.Annuals benefit from nurturing indoors and then hardening off before placing into the garden when all danger of frost has passed.Here are some of the easiest flowers to grow from seed.. Sunflower Growing sunflowers is childs play, and is favoured by parents keen to get their youngsters involved in gardening. They have large seeds - perfect for small hands - and can be started off indoors in February and March in inidual pots in potting compost, and then transferred to their final position in late May or early June.. CosmosThese pretty half hardy annuals come in an abundance of colours, from white to deep pink. They are great for plugging gaps in the summer border with their feathery leaves and daisy-like flowers. However, they wont withstand frost, so youll need to start them off indoors in a seed tray or pots, with one seed per cell.. Nicotiana These annual favourites have a delicious perfume, so plant them close to the house or on the patio once they are coming into flower. Sow seeds in seed compost indoors in early spring, on a sunny windowsill. Sprinkle a small pinch of seeds in each cell, then cover them with vermiculite and water lightly.. Nasturtium These pretty trailers have multiple uses - they can add colour to summer pots, the flowers can be eaten and they can even lure aphids away from French and runner beans - and theyre really easy to grow from seed. Start them off indoors in seed trays of compost in February, placing the large seeds a few centimetres apart on the surface, then cover with another layer of compost, firming it gently. Place a sheet of cling film over the seed tray and put in a warm spot on a windowsill or in a light area. Once theyve germinated, you can remove the cover and in a week or two youll be able to transplant them into seven centimetre pots, before putting them in their final spot in the garden in early summer.. Calornian poppy Calornian poppies can be sown in spring or under cover now. They have delicate ferny foliage and bright yellow, orange, red or white flowers that are a magnet for butterflies, bees and hoverflies. The poppies make good cut flowers and thrive in poor but well drained soil.. CalendulaBeautul orange and yellow flowers are produced from these seeds for an extended flowering period, lasting until the first hard frost and sometimes beyond. Its a great companion plant to include in your vegetable garden to attract beneficial insects and keep the pests distracted. The flowers are edible and can be used in soups and salads. Its also easy to collect seed to re-sow the following year.. Cleome These unusual hairy annuals produce impressive upright stems to .m, with scented flowers in shades of violet-pink, rose-red or white from early summer to early autumn. They are another excellent gap-filler in borders, where they extend colour later in the season, or are great grown in large containers.Quick guide to sowing seedEmma ONeill, head gardener at national horticultural charity Garden Organic , offers the following tips for seed-sowing success.Read the packet. Seed packets carry a wealth of information detailing when to sow, how deep, the spacing required and what sort of temperature they need to germinate effectively.Use organic seed compost. Fill your tray or pot with good quality organic seed compost, first ensuring you dont have any large lumps, tamping down to make sure there are no air gaps, and firm using another seed tray or pot to level it. If the seeds require covering, sieve a small amount over the top and firm again so they are in good contact with the compost.Water before sowing. Use a fine rose on a watering can, or sit the tray in water.Label. Otherwise you may not remember what you planted.Thin out.

Within a month of trying it himself, Cho noticed improvements in his asthma, eczema and psoriasis.Of course, everyones body is dferent and may react dferently - its worth checking with a medical professionalyoure considering big diet changes, especiallyyou have existing health conditions - but for them, Huang says it was \"quite a revelation\".It encouraged her to experiment with plant-based foods, which initially felt at odds with her background. \"Being a Chinese chef, we experiment, and being a Chinese food connoisseur youve got to try everything,\" she confesses.However, Huang did find plant-based eating aligned well with the Chinese philosophies shed been brought up on by her family in Southern Taiwan.\"Ive always believed in you are what you eat, [and] a balanced diet,\" she explains. \"I grew up with my parents and my grandparents, and they eat seasonally.\"Think about yin and yang balancing hot and cooling foods depending on your body, a little bit like the Indian Ayurvedic principle of eating. If youre tired and stressed, your bodys very yang -youre always cold and shivery, then your bodys too yin, youre having too many yang and fiery foods.\"So how do you balance this yin and yang  Firstly, Huang says: \"You literally just need to listen to your gut\" - then youll be able to properly judge what your body needs. She remembers her grandmother saying\"you eat too many vegetables, you need to have ginger because vegetables are yin and ginger is very yang - its fiery, so it balances your body. On a vegan diet, you need to have more garlic, ginger, chillies - more yang dishes,\" she explains. \"Mostly, yang ingredients are from meat.\"How you cook your meals also plays a part. \"Steaming is more yin and stir-frying is more yang,\" says Huang. \"Overall, were trying to create the perfect balance. I think its really hard in the modern day to try and create this balance - to even understand it - but I think food is a conduit to that.\"We could be bombarded with all this technology and science, but you actually have to listen to our instincts.\"For Huang, it made sense to adopt a plant-based diet, saying it \"aligns with who I am\" - and the results make it worth it. Asked how she feels, she says: \"Much healthier and lighter, I just have more energy - but obviously everyone should do whats right for them\".The chef doesnt just think about the personal reasons for going plant-based, but the bigger picture as well. She says: \"If we look at ourselves as an entity, then look at ourselves in a greater picture, in a way it is a reflection of what weve done to this planet - the way we pollute the planet and the way we over-consume.\"Everything is about balance, sowere out of balance, then were going to be ill. The same thingwe over-pollute the planet, its not going to create the best environment for us.\"Her recipes are democratic, she says. \"Not all of us are from the same background, but we all love food and we want it to be a simple process. If you cook something and it works and you feel happy and satisfied about it, then youre more likely to cook again.\"Once people cook, its a way to express love, because youre taking care of yourself. And once you learn how to cook and youre confident, then you know how to cook for somebody .\"For Huang, this is the ultimate way to show you care, and \" you choose to cook compassionately, then youre looking after the greater and youre extending your love to everything \".Huang might look at things very philosophically but she does so with a light touch - and without any judgement. She just wants to encourage people to \"try it for yourself\". If youre thinking about a vegan diet, Huang recommends doing so with a group of friends, \"so youre not alone\".She says simply: \"Whether its for animals, or your health, or you just want to try something new, I think people should celebrate more veg.\"Let this plant-based cheesecake transport you to a tropical island.Not convinced vegan desserts can be luxurious Why not try Ching-He Huangs recipe for creamy mango and cashew cheesecake...Mango and cashew vegan cheesecake recipeIngredients:For the biscuit base:g fruity vegan oat biscuitstbsp mixed nut butterFor the cashew cheese layer:g cashews, soaked in water for  minutes then drained and rinsedml coconut milkg plain coconut yogurttbsp coconut creamtbsp golden syrupJuice of  limePinch of sea saltFor the fresh mango compote: mangos, peeled, stoned and diced into .cm cubestbsp golden syrupTo garnish:Zest and juice of  limeMethod:.

Nonetheless, I am restraining myself, and so, Irsquom pleased to say, are all but the most idiotic Brexiteer backbenchers.Even Mr Johnsonrsquos homicidal government, yoursquoll notice, has not been crowing about how badly the EU has done, compared with how well they have. This despite the fact that in the -hour period around Sunday, the UK inoculated more than a million people ndash about a third as many in one day as the whole of the EU had managed by the end of last week.: Economy: Wersquove been well and truly done by BrexitInstead of complaining about the EUrsquos attempt to break international law within a month of signing a treaty, jeopardising the Anglo-Irish agreement in order to cover up the failings of its own market provision ndash exactly what it accused the UK Government of intending to do ndash ministers chose to portray Ursula von der Leyenrsquos decision to trigger Article  as a mistake quickly identied and rectied.That was more forgiving than most of the continental press ndash Die Zeitrsquos headline said that the vaccine row was a vindication of Brexit ndash or even of other EU officials, such as Michel Barnier, who was scathing. When Sinn Fein, the DUP and the Archbishop of Canterbury unite in condemning you, as one EU official put it, ldquoyou can be pretty sure yoursquove messed up big time. This whole affair is, however, neither a vindication of Brexit, nor a condemnation of the EU. Itrsquos merely an example of the way in which far too many people are inclined to ignore basic points of fact in order to maintain that ldquotheir side is right.There are certainly some things to condemn. Emmanuel Macronrsquos claim that the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine doesnrsquot work on the over-s is, letrsquos be blunt, a Trump-level lie. The EUrsquos intervention that created a three-month delay in its schedule, basically in order to save money and insist Brussels should be in charge, now looks like a bad mistake.But then the UK approach, which threw money at everything, and funded more than  per cent of the development of a vaccine that there was no guarantee would work, might easily not have come off. There are lots of other factors besides the EUrsquos bureaucracy and the UKrsquos good luck and good planning, including some ndash like the reluctance of a surprising number of EU citizens to be vaccinated ndash that are entirely outwith anyonersquos control.That the UK has, at this point, one of the four or five highest death rates per capita ndash even after you allow for the fact that not everyone calculates their figures in a like-for-like fashion ndash should certainly be an indication that plenty of mistakes have been made here .But itrsquos also true that the UKrsquos vaccination programme is, with the possible exception of Israelrsquos, the most effective anywhere. And it remains possible,it works as well as predicted, that the UKrsquos record may not in the end be as bad as it currently looks. Countries like Germany and France, whose per capita record in case-fatalities is within a couple of tenths of a percentage point of ours, could conceivably end up worse, as Belgium and Italy already are by many measures.One suspects that some people, that is the people who assured us that the UKrsquos failure to sign up to the EMA programme was akin to building death camps, would secretly rather like the country to fail. I can understand this tendency in nationalists who want to maintain that wersquove done better than England, which therersquos little evidence we have.Itrsquos more puzzling south of the border, unless you take George Orwellrsquos view that England is ldquothe only great country whose intellectuals are ashamed of their own nationality.But all these attitudes are seeing a global catastrophe as some sort of competition. Quite apart from the basic humanity of not taking that approach, itrsquos hard to see that party politics comes into the pandemic at all. Naturally the UK Governmentrsquos primary obligation is to protect its citizens. Evenyou think itrsquos done the worldrsquos worst job thus far, you ought to acknowledge that, in vaccine provision, itrsquos doing one of the best. By the same token, the EU wants the same for the citizens of its countries, evenitrsquos blundered badly in trying to do so.: Son goes in search of the ghosts of his fathers wartime pastBut the virus, being a virus, isnrsquot especially interested in anything of the sort and, as a consequence, it wonrsquot do the UK much long-term goodwe get everyone vaccinated, but the disease is running wild where. New Zealand and Australia donrsquot need to worry about urgent vaccination, because their remoteness and border closures halted the disease in its tracks at an early stage. Western European countries havenrsquot had that option,they ever did, since this time last year.The UKrsquos contribution to vaccine development has already been altruistic one condition of the Oxford AZ plan was that it be sold at cost to developing countries.

These can be no doubt that Covid- will mutate further into other virulent iants. To invite some , participants, plus media, plus others, to COP in Glasgow while this pandemic is raging round the globe is beyond reckless.The UK might be well on the way to vaccinating a majority of the populace by then, but we cannot know how effective this vaccine will be to new iants not yet identied. Much of the world will not be inoculated by November, so this conference should be digital, not face-to-face.Boris Johnson has shown he is both impetuous and reckless where his own health is concerned, but the whole of the UK should not be placed at risk for the sake of Mr Johnsons narcissistic need to host a conference which, with modern technology, can easily take place online.GR Weir, Ochiltree.DONATE ANY SURPLUS VACCINEAMID increasing calls for the UK to share its coronavirus vaccine with poorer countries, one mustnt forget that Boris Johnson as the Prime Minister of the UK has a primary obligation to safeguard the wellbeing of its people. His position would be untenable and there would be an outcrythe UK gave away doses of the vaccine while people in the UK were still dying because of the unavailability of the vaccine.Once the UK population is protected, surplus vaccine should be donated to poor countries, an excellent way to spend the controversial foreign aid budget and one which surely few people would object to.Bob MacDougall, Kippen.WHY THE VACCINE DELAY FROM day , the First Minister said that the vaccine roll-out would be dependent on the availability of vaccines being supplied by the UK Government. Perhaps Nicola Sturgeon would like to explain why  per cent of the vaccine allocation to Scotland is sitting in storage awaiting drawdown or sitting in freezers here in Scotland. Vaccines donrsquot protect the public from Covid, vaccinations do.The Scottish Government has dragged its heels in this rollout. There was no reason not to vaccinate in care homes and in the community simultaneously as they would not be carried out by the same staff.Rather than spending time \"refining\" targets, the Scottish Government should spend more time getting the vaccines into arms.Jane Lax, Aberlour.DONT MAKE SIMPLISTIC COMPARISONSWR McCrindlehighlighted that the UKs horric Covid- death toll of over , from a population of  million was worse than the American death toll of over , from a population of  million. This was despite the UK having one of the best public health services in the developed world, while the US has one of the worst. Neither nation can be congratulated on political control of the pandemic.There are many reasons why the spread of Covid- and related death tolls ies from one country to another. One reason, often of limited importance, is quite the opposite when comparing the UK and US namely population, both density and distribution. Both countries have an overall urban population of about  per cent, but there much of the similarity ends, for reasons of basic geography.The US is one of the largest countries in the world, while the UK is a small country. Indeed, the UK would fit at least twice into the area of Texas, second-largest state out of  in the US. The UK apparently has an average population density per square kilometre of about , compared to under  in the US.Within the UK there is considerable interaction virus transmission between dferent parts of our relatively small country. However, in the US the population in the west is largely confined to a narrow strip along the coast from Calornian cities in the south to Seattle in the north. Hundreds or thousands of miles away across the Rocky Mountains, and beyond an underdeveloped interior, more than half the US population lives to the east of the Mississippi River including in the highly-populated states of Florida and New York. When those from east and west meet in person, this is presumably mainly by air travel which in itself would influence the spread of the virus.Simplistic comparisons of countries are to be avoided, especially when designed to undermine travel restrictions and lockdown, though this was not the case with Mr McCrindles letter. Our apparent vaccination success may see the UK death toll fall below that of the US in relation to population. Ultimately, however, the end of the pandemic will only be achieved when the spread of the vaccines is engineered to meet global needs.This does not appear to be imminent.Mrs F Greenlaw, Balloch.LET DOWN BY POOR LEADERSWHEN we are repeatedly told the pandemic is being well managed, I think of scotch eggs, blue envelopes, badges, clapping, the lack of PPE for an oft-predicted pandemic, breaches of rules by MPs and MSPs and the exceptions made for the elite, and I think we might be better resorting to prayer.

And I was very moved by the characters.\"The star notes The Dig, which was adapted from the novel by John Preston, \"was a hard film to get into production. Its the style of film people were making  years ago.\"But producer Gaby Tana believed in the project passionately - and it was to become the fth collaboration for her and Fiennes.Written by Moira Buffini, with Simon Stone as director, the historical drama also stars Carey Mulligan as wealthy widow Edith Pretty, who hires amateur archaeologist Basil Brown to excavate the burial mounds on her estate.The story sees Edith learning she has a terminal illness, and there are tender scenes in which Basil has a conversation with her son Robert, as he comes to terms with his mothers situation.\"Robert feels like hes failing to support his sick mother and Basil tells him, We all fail. Every day we fail. Were carried on a current of le and we have to accept our failures,\" Fiennes describes.\"Its less about leaving something behind, and more that, by having a relationship with the past, it gives us a better understanding of ourselves and a better context of where we came from. Which in turn gives us an understanding about le.\"Fiennes is contemplative and thoughtful with his answers you can tell this was a story he was genuinely excited to bring to the screen.Interestingly, it took a long time for the real Basil Brown to be recognised for the incredible work he did with Sutton Hoo.When the treasure he excavated was first shown to the general public in , his name was not mentioned - but it now appears alongside that of Edith in the British Museums permanent display.Askedpart of the appeal of The Dig was to teach people about Basils incredible achievements, and how important they were, Fiennes responds: \"I mean, yes, I think people will want to find out about the Sutton Hoo.\"But the first thing I responded to was the human drama of Mrs Pretty and Basil and the relationship with the other characters and what was going on.\"He was especially passionate to do the role because he loved the writing.\"It was wonderful in a world where we get a lot of sensational films, or films that have either a strong romantic element or action element or horror element, this is modulated beautully... I used to say it was like Chekhov.\"He elaborates: \"I love Chekhov. I love how the lives are very delicately written, but huge shts are changing inside people. But the external drama is quite gentle.\"I love Chekhov because his characters seem close to all of us our desires, our wishes, our disappointments, aspirations. And then I think The Dig does all that, but at the centre is this extraordinary discovery of an Anglo-Saxon burial ship. So the mix of history, Chekhovian drama I thought it was refreshing, given that theres a lot of stuff thats a lot more high definition, in film making.\"Fiennes - who has also worked as a director on films Coriolanus, The Invisible Woman and The White Crow - agrees The Dig is a nuanced story, in which there is a lot happening beneath the surface with characters.\"Those films are risky, of course, because they can fall flat. You know, delicate human drama can be another word for boring - butthe inherent internal le is available, you can lean into something thats not telling you everything, because theres a tension. Thats what a good novel does, I think.\"He continues: \"I like those kinds of dramas -theyre well done, and you feel there are huge undercurrents happening in peoples lives and the interior world of people is rich.

The total number of deaths, under this measure, is now ,.Once again, I send my condolences to all those who have lost a loved one during this pandemic.Presiding OfficerThe level of Covid infections clearly remains too high.However, the most recent figures provide further evidence that lockdown restrictions are working to improve the situation.Average daily case numbers have more than halved in the last three weeks.In the most recent week - up to  January - an average of , confirmed new cases were reported each day. weeks ago, the average daily number was more than ,.Weekly case numbers per , of the population have fallen from  in week ending  January to  in the most recent week.Test positivity has also reduced. In the seven days up to  January it averaged .% - still higher, but closer than it has been in recent weeks, to the % that the WHO consider to be indicative of an outbreak being under control.Pressure on our NHS continues to be severe. The number of Covid patients being treated in hospital remains around % above the high point of the first wave last April.However, hospital admissions in this wave appear to have peaked on  January. They have now stabilised and are starting to reduce, albeit slowly.ICU numbers are more volatile, but they did not reach the peak of the first wave and appear to have peaked in this wave on  January.So all in all, the statistics show real progress.However, this progress is down to compliance with the lockdown restrictions.And the situation continues to be fragile.Case numbers remain higher now than in the week before Christmas.That means thatwe were to ease restrictions too quickly, there is a real risk that infections would rise again very quickly.That risk is increased by the fact that the new iant of Covid ndash which is more infectious ndash now accounts for around % of all new cases in Scotland.I can also advise parliament that Public Health Scotland is examining evidence suggesting that there may be an increased risk of hospitalisation of people infected with the new iant.However, at this stage, there is no statistically signicant evidence of any increased risk of death.Public Health Scotland is continuing to analyse the evidence on both of these points.I can also advise Parliament that to date there have been  cases of the new South African iant identied in Scotland. All of these have links to travel which means that there is no evidence so far of community transmission of that iant.All of what I have just set out underlines the need for continued caution in our fight against Covid, especiallywe want to get some children back to school later this month.That is why Cabinet has reached the conclusion that the lockdown restrictions must stay in place until at least the end of February.However,our progress continues, then I am cautiously optimistic that, as more and more people get vaccinated, and with the protection of some of the additional measures that I will cover shortly, we may be able to begin looking towards a careful and gradual easing around the start of March.I will give an update on that in two weeks.Let me now report on the progress of our vaccination programme.I can confirm that we have now given a first dose of the vaccine to ,  people in Scotland.That includes % of all residents in older care homes - which is a truly extraordinary uptake - and % of the number of over s we estimate to be living in the community. Irsquollto that point shortly.In addition, I can advise that % of over  year olds have already received their first dose.We are on track to have vaccinated, with the first dose, all over  year olds, and all adults who are classed as being especially clinically vulnerable, by the middle of this month.Vaccination of the  -  age group is also underway from this week.And those aged  to , and unpaid carers, will start to receive appointments from the third week of February.So we are making rapid progress in protecting those who are most at risk from Covid.Now, I expect there will be legitimate questions today about the overall number of vaccinations in Scotland compared to other parts of the U.K.That is reasonable. However, I would make two initial points.Firstly, we have been trying to achieve as high an uptake as possible in the top priority groups - and we believe we are achieving a higher uptake than where.So for example, we havenrsquot just offered vaccination to all older people in care homes - we have achieved an actual uptake of % amongst residents and % amongst staff working in older peoplersquos care homes.That really matters in terms of reducing the burden of illness and deaths.Similarly in the over s groups. The % I reported earlier is based on a cohort number that we think is overestimated.The work we have been doing with health boards to refine these numbers suggests that the actual uptake amongst the over s group is already closer to %.These uptake figures are way beyond anything achieved in the flu vaccine programme.Vaccinating the most vulnerable to the greatest extent possible is really important, evenit takes more time to do so.It will help to save more lives.All of that said, though, it is clearly the case that overall volumes matter too - and that leads to my second point.As we make more use of mass vaccination centres for the younger age groups, we expect the daily rate to also increase.The figure reported today, for example, shows just under , first dose vaccinations were done yesterday - reflecting the opening of new centres.That is our highest daily number so far - and % higher than last Monday.So having achieved greater depth in the programme so far, in the form of high actual uptake in priority groups, our challenge now is to accelerate on breadth, in the form of numbers overall. And that is what we will be doing.It is right though that all of this is subject to close and ongoing scrutiny. And we will continue to provide the daily figures that allow that to happen.Presiding OfficerAs we continue to suppress the virus within our own borders and increase the protection of the vaccine, it is essential that we also guard against fresh importation of cases from overseas.This is particularly important as the virus mutates and new, more infectious and potentially more severe iants emerge.And as we look ahead, we must learn from past experience.We now know, for example, that by early July last year, we had almost eliminated Covid in Scotland but then allowed it to be re-seeded from overseas travel.We must guard against that happening again.It is to that end that the four UK nations have already agreed that travellers coming into the U.K. from countries with a travel ban in place will be required to quarantine in hotels.This is a necessary measure ndash but in the Scottish Governmentrsquos view, it does not go far enough.Firstly, there should be very few people coming from countries with a ban in place anyway.Second, this approach leaves open the possibility that people will travel into the UK from those countries via third countries.And thirdly, an approach to managed quarantine that only includes countries where new iants have already been identied is too reactive - because often by the time a new iant has been identied through genomic sequencing, it will already have spread across borders.I can therefore confirm today that we intend to introduce a managed quarantine requirement for anyone who arrives directly into Scotland, regardless of which country they have come from.Obviously, we cannot unilaterally implement immediatemanaged quarantine for people who arrive in other parts of the UK before travelling on to Scotland.So we will continue to urge the UK Government to adopt a comprehensive approach.Andthey do not wish to do so - as is their prerogative - we will ask them to work with us to reduce the risk amongst people travelling to Scotland via ports where in the U.K.We will set out more detail of how and when the managed quarantine system will be operationalised as soon as possible.I understand how tough restrictions are for our travel and aviation industry, so we will also work with the UK Government to ensure the sector gets the support it needs until such time as we are able to start to ease travel restrictionsPresiding OfficerIt is vital that we guard against the importation of new Covid cases.But it is also crucial that we continue to identy cases and break chains of transmission here in Scotland.We are already increasing the accessibility of testing ndash for example by increasing the number of mobile test facilities that are available, creating additional local and regional test centres, and making more use of fire service stations for testing in rural areasToday, I can set out a further expansion of regular, routine testing of those without symptoms.Firstly, we will from later this month widen the regular testing of healthcare workers so that it covers primary care workers in patient-facing roles - such as GPs, dentists, optometrists, and pharmacists.From mid-February, regular testing will also be available to all staff who work directly with patients in hospices.We also intend to expand the availability of regular testing in other health settings, such as addiction and mental health services.We will also introduce targeted testing to support some essential public service s, including emergency service control rooms and NHS.Staff and patients in certain health settings obviously face an elevated risk of transmission, which is why it is right to have such a focus on those.However, we know that there are some industries which also have higher transmission risks - such as food production and distribution.We are therefore working with businesses in those sectors, with a view to introducing routine testing for their workforces over the course of this month.Alongside these proposals to test people whose work potentially puts them at risk, we will be expanding targeted community testing ndash where testing is made available to everybody in a local area, regardless of whether or not they have symptoms.This can play a particularly valuable role in communities where prevalence is stubbornly high or starting to rise again.In recent weeks, local authorities have been submitting proposals for community testing.We have been considering those proposals in light of the lessons from the pilot projects conducted at the end of last year.Community schemes have already been agreed across  local authorities, within the health board areas of Fe, Grampian and Ayrshire and Arran.By the end of this week we will have agreed community testing plans across the majority of mainland Local Authority areas.In addition, mobile testing units are already being used for targeted community testing in Ayrshire  Arran, Dumfries  Galloway, Scottish Borders and Forth Valley.These testing units ndash which are offering tests to people regardless of whether or not they have symptoms - are already finding cases on a daily basis that would otherwise not be found.The purpose of increased testing is to break more chains of transmission.However, that requires good support for self isolation.The latest available survey evidence suggests that there is good compliance with self isolation.However, we know we need to do more.I can therefore confirm today that we will be extending eligibility for the pound self isolation payment to everyone on an income below the level of the real living wage.More details of this and the other steps we intend taking to support people required to self isolate will be set out by the Social Security Secretary shortly.Let me turn now to education.It is a statement of the obvious that all of us want to see children and young people back in full time, face to face education as soon as possible.The closure of school premises to most pupils right now is necessary - unfortunately - in the interests of protecting the country overall from the harm of this virus.But evidence of the wider health, developmental and social harms being experienced by children and young people concern all of us - and they do so more with every day that passes.I am also acutely aware of the pressure school closures is putting on working parents and on family le more generally.Now, I have to be candid that our room for manoeuvre, given the current state of the pandemic, is limited.But I want to be equally candid about the governmentrsquos determination to use every inch of headroom we have to get children back to school.In short, the judgment the Cabinet arrived at this morning, based on the advice of our expert advisers, is thatwe all agree to abide with the lockdown restrictions for a bit longer, so that our progress in suppressing the virus continues, we can begin a phased, albeit gradual,to school from  February.The decisions I am about to outline are intended to give young people, parents and teachers as much notice as possible, but I must stress that they are subject to continued progress in suppressing the virus and will be subject to final confirmation in two weeksrsquo time.However, as of now, our intention is that from week beginning  February there will be -- a full timeof early learning and childcare for all children below school age- a full timeto school for pupils in primaries  -  and- a part time , but on a very limited basis, for senior phase pupils to allow in-school practical work that is necessary for the completion of national qualication courses. Initially, though, it is intended that there will be no more than around  - % of a secondary school roll physically present at any one time for these purposes.We also intend to allow small increases in existing provision for children and young people with signicant additional support needs where there is a clear and demonstrable necessity.We will confirm these decisions in two weeksrsquo time. At that stage, I hope we can also set out the next phase of the gradualto school and a timescale for theof in-person learning in colleges and universities.Presiding OfficerI spoke about testing earlier on and that is relevant here too.I can confirm that there will be a signicant expansion of testing in educational settings to support theto nurseries and schools in the weeks ahead.It is our intention that those who work in schools, and in early learning and childcare settings attached to schools, will be offered at-home testing twice a week. All senior phase secondary school students will be offered this too.This testing offer will be in place for schools as soon as possible to support their , and we will extend it to the wider childcare sector in the weeks after that.We are determined to get our children back to normal schooling just as quickly as it is safe to do so. It is our overriding priority.For now, let me again thank young people and their families, as well as teachers, and school and nursery staff, for the patience and understanding you are showing during these incredibly stressful times.Presiding OfficerTo conclude, we are making progress, both in suppressing the virus and in getting people vaccinated.But the path ahead remains dficult. The virus is still circulating and, of even greater concern, it is mutating.So we must remain vigilant and disciplined.To get the virus more under control, and so that we can prioritise every bit of headroom we create to get children back to school, we must all stay at home except for permitted, essential purposes for a bit longer - at least until the end of this month.And when we are able to start the process of slowly easing lockdown, to give us all more normality in our day to day lives, we will have to accept that some mitigations, like physical distancing and face coverings, will be necessary for a while yet.And I am afraid we will also have to accept that the price of greater domestic normality is likely to be - for a period at least - not going on holiday overseas.These are not easy trade-offs. But they are essential as we continue our journey through and hopefully out of this pandemic.I am grateful to everyone for their continued sacrice.Please stick with it.Stay at home. Protect the NHS.

How can anyone doubt the threat this poses, and go around feeling insouciant and safe  At a time when every shop door handle holds the menace of a grenade, such an outlook is unfathomable.Yet it is not as uncommon as you might think. Nor is it linked to intelligence or education, or lack thereof. For whatever reason, baffling though it is to those of us who trust reliable sources of information, there are countless iniduals who are adamant that Covid is either a hoax, a conspiracy, or a fuss about nothing and that the vaccines are intended to wipe us out. Behind all this lie malevolent manipulators, intent on...well, quite what they hope to achieve by terrying or killing us off remains unclear, but the fear remains potent.Astonishingly, not all Covid naysayers come to their senses when they fall victim. Last autumn, as cases in the US soared, there were reports of victims gasping for air in the emergency room, yet still insisting that Covid was fake. That really does take the breath away. ROSEMARY: In praise of JennersSomehow, though, it feels worse that anyone here could also deny it. It is not aswe live in a chaotic or rogue state, where we have been deluged in unchallenged propaganda or starved of reliable information. Nor is that information dficult to access. Indeed, one of the most miserable aspects of the past year has been the dogged coverage of escalating tragedy: footage of mortuaries filled with the dead, of serried ranks of coffins in funeral homes, of the mortally ill saying goodbye to their loved ones from behind oxygen masks.Do Covid deniers never watch, listen or read the news, or do they tune in only to what they want to believe  Certainly, down the rabbit holes of social media it is possible to find yourself in a netherworld, so far from reality you could be a character Alice in Wonderland. Except that Alice kept her wits about her, and never lost her grip on sanity.Alarmingly, as is becoming clear, the pandemic is only the latest of the fault lines opening up between people whose world views lie at opposite ends of a spectrum. We can mock thwarted Trump voters who continue to believe that the election was rigged, despite not an iota of evidence to support that conclusion. Unlike Covid, where the facts are omnipresent, the US election result has been contested without any foothold in reality. Believing the Democrats cheated says more about protestersrsquo state of mind than about what the ballot boxes contained.And yet, their certainty and grievance are real therersquos no denying that. Nor is any of us entirely immune to being manipulated by tricks or lies. You can point to the Brexiteer threats of a tsunami of immigrationwe stayed in the EU as an egregious hood, but many of those who swallowed it whole were already at a point where it merely bolstered their convictions, rather than shaped them.When it comes to medical denial, there is a long and sorry history of refusniks. Just think of John Gummer, obliging his daughter to eat a beef burger on camera to show that there was no danger of Mad Cow Disease . The government similarly played down the dangers of contracting salmonella from eggs, until Edwina Currie spoke up.The more facts and figures we are bombarded with, in our never-sleeping news cycle, the trickier it becomes to find a reasonable position between unquestioning credulity and healthy scepticism. For years it was possible to be a climate change denier, and remain intellectually credible. Now, yoursquore considered nuttyyou still donrsquot get it.What is troubling about those who refuse to believe what is happening around them, despite the evidence of their own eyes, is that it doesnrsquot make sense. It suggests wholesale disparagement, mistrust or terror of those who run the country, a determination to find hidden and sinister motives behind every announcement and regulation.Some deniers, doubtless, have no guiding principles or cosmology whatsoever, and simply prefer to ignore the wider world beyond their walls. In general, though, the level of suspicion and the passion with which untenable beliefs are held are motivated by something far stronger than lack of engagement. Discrediting Covid even when it has you in its grip denouncing global warming, despite the wildfire sweeping over your house, suggest advanced paranoia and a sense of persecution. ROSEMARY: In the footsteps of medievel pilgrimsNor is such an outlook entirely unreasonable at all times. Leadership in many countries is at worst despotic, and at the best, frequently mendacious, opaque, contradictory and evasive. Traditional media outlets deliver news that is properly researched and sourced, yet often biased in tone or emphasis. And the web is awash not just with documented fact but with misinformation that goes largely unchallenged.The fact that anyone can seriously and sustainedly deny Covidrsquos existence is merely the tip of an iceberg wersquove been trying to ignore. It is a shocking demonstration of a breakdown in societal trust and cohesion. When people refuse to acknowledge reality, and choose instead to believe what they want to believe, facts, truth, testimonies, photographic or recorded proof are cast aside as irrelevant.Despite the decline in religion in the West, maybe there is an ongoing hunger to put faith in the unprovable and intangible, an urge for creeds and a community of the likeminded based on unveriable feelings and imaginary connections.

Its asTony Blair had sacked Gordon Brown in . It has brought to a head three isions which have shattered the unity of the Scottish National Party: the Salmond affair, the transphobia row and the lack of progress toward independence.Ms Cherry had called for Alex Salmond to be readmitted to the party after he was acquitted of all sex harassment charges last year. This did not endear her to the party leader. Next week, Mr Salmond is scheduled to give evidence to the Holyrood inquiry investigating how the Government came to lose a total of pound, fighting a doomed defence against his judicial review in . There has been a clearing of the decks in advance of this appearance, in which the former leader is expected to blow open the conspiracy he claims led to his downfall.Read more: The jury found him innocent but Alex Salmond is still on trialMs Cherry has also been an inconveniently outspoken supporter of womens rights. Indeed, she may be the first senior politician to be sacked for believing that a woman is an adult human female. She is a lesbian and a feminist who does not accept that womens sex-based rights should be sacriced on the alter of an ideology which denies that sex is binary. In short, she does not believe ldquotranswomen ARE women. For months, Ms Cherry has been the target of vilication, abuse and even death threats from numerous trans activists in and out of the party.This is such an arcane issue, baffling to the vast majority of Scottish voters, that it seems hard to believe it could have come to this. But Nicola Sturgeon has staked her reputation on driving through a new Gender Recognition Act which will allow men to self-identy, legally, as women merely by making a declaration to that effect. Last week the First Minister made a thinly-veiled attack on Ms Cherry in a video accusing her own party of transphobia. Yesterday, amendments to the much-criticised Hate Crime Bill that would have protected ldquogender-critical women like Ms Cherry from prosecution for ldquostirring up hatred were suddenly withdrawn by the Justice Secretary, Humza Yousaf.The key amendment gave freedom of speech protection to ldquodiscussion, criticism or rejection of concepts or beliefs relating to transgender identity. It also protected ldquostating that there are only two sexes and using the words ldquoman and ldquowoman to define a persons sex. The deletion of these amendments could mean that women who object to the presence of natal men in their changing rooms, or in womens sporting events, may in future be committing a criminal offence.The SNP NEC has been trying to enforce a new definition of transphobia in which even the phrase ldquoadult human female would itself be regarded as hate speech. However, it is also the dictionary definition of a woman, andquoting it is to be regarded as transphobia then there might have to be a bonfire of biology textbooks. Universities could have trouble teaching medical students about binary human reproduction.Read more: Dont tell women what makes a woman: they were born that wayMs Cherry is an experienced advocate and the best legal mind in the SNP. She took Boris Johnson to the Supreme Court in  over his prorogation of Parliament and won. In recent months she had been advocating a legal route to independence through court action on Indyref. This is a route which Ms Sturgeon has reportedly endorsed herself. So it might seem perverse to dispense with the services of the only figure in the party with the legal expertise to prosecute it. But in the SNP right now legal expertise appears to be regarded as a threat.These issues have been boiling and roiling beneath the surface of SNP politics for the last two years. The waves of scandal have been lapping around Ms Sturgeons ankles as she tries to deal with the pandemic. Now, rather like Chairman Mao in , she has decided to deal with troublesome opposition by launching a purge, and giving a green light to trans activists in her youth wing, who are highly organised on social media.There is a generational ide in the SNP. Many younger nationalists are zealous advocates of identity politics. Older, analogue politicians, like the former Justice Secretary, Kenny MacAskill tend to side with Mr Salmond and Ms Cherry. The influential Wings Over Scotland blog, penned by the Rev Stuart Campbell, which was essential reading for independence supporters in , is now calling for the resignation of Ms Sturgeon and the ldquowoke legions who are her new praetorian guard.Wings has been assisting the former British diplomat, Craig Murray, in his attempts to disclose details of the alleged conspiracy against Mr Salmond. Mr Murray is in turn defending himself against contempt of court charges relating to the Salmond trial. Another prolic SNP blogger, James Kelly of Scotland Goes Pop, has called on Mr Salmond to launch a new independence party.Like most SNP intellectuals, Mr Kelly had been arguing that it would be senseless to promote ision on the eve of a crucial election which could trigger independence. The SNP lead in the polls indicates a landslide in May. However, he now believes the situation is so dire that the two wings ndash no pun intended ndash can no longer coexist.The truth is that many in the party no longer believe that Ms Sturgeon is serious about delivering independence ndash at least not in any timescale they would regard as acceptable. Thousands have reportedly left in disgust. Ms Sturgeon dominates Scottish opinion polls and the opposition parties are disarray. Her biggest political threat now comes from within her own party.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

In spite of the pandemic, the UK Government pursued Brexit. This was the greatest change to the UK constitution in  years.

The real reason for the visit, I am convinced, was the onset of panic at the string of Scottish poll results showing a majority for independence.As for Mr Joness advice to pensioners to \"squirrel plenty of money away\" to pay for future council tax rises, I would ask Mr. Jones: what with Alison Lambie, Stirling.SPINNING OVER THE VACCINESJANE Laxhas fallen for the UK Governmentrsquos spin over Covid jags, as England has similar problems over supplies.On January , NHS England advised that all care home residents and staff would receive their first jag by  January ldquoat the latest but letters only went out last week. At the weekend several leading care home operators in England complained that only around a half of residents had been vaccinated due to a shortage of supplies.England also experienced the same problems over Sunday vaccinations, as the UK administered , doses on Saturday, January  but only managed around half as many the following day.Extrapolating from the Scottish data that the UK Government tried to suppress, the UK may be administering vaccines at around half the pace it receives supply, yet the same UK Government and the unionist parties are spinning and politicising the vaccine roll-out in Scotland.This of course has been taken up by the media, including the BBC, yet they steadfastly refuse to publish the easily-available comparable number of cases and mortality rates in the four home nations as this shows Scotland in a much better light thanks to the tireless efforts of our NHS staff and Nicola Sturgeonrsquos clear leadership.Mary Thomas, Edinburgh EH.PENALISED FOR SHIELDINGMY we and I are both  and I must confess I am bemused by the logic behind the vaccination programme in our health board area.The s and s have been vaccinated by our hard-working GPs in a local centre set up within the village a few minutes walk away.

Our focus is on the recovery and rebuilding our country after the pandemic, declared the partyrsquos economy spokesman.Noting how the Treasury had already given pound billion to help Scotland cope with the pandemic, the MSP added: ldquoScotland in the United Kingdom is vital to our economic recovery.Scottish Labourrsquos Anas Sarwar insisted the analysis confirmed the SNPrsquos plan for an independent Scotland would lead to deeper austerity, which was why his party opposed it.ldquoThe dficult years ahead of us must be about economic recovery, not inflicting further economic pain on our communities and people who are already struggling, declared Scottish Labourrsquos constitution spokesman and candidate to be its next leader.ldquoRather thanto the old politics of ision, the next parliament must be a Covid Recovery Parliament that focuses on bringing people together, he added.Pamela Nash, Chief Executive of Scotland in Union, described the report as ldquodevastating and claimed it exposed the economic damage the SNP wanted to inflict on people with its negative vision for Scotlandrsquos future.ldquoLeaving the UK would take money away from vital public services like the NHS and schools for the sake of a border with England, declared the former Labour MP.ldquoThat would be unforgiveable at any time, let alone in the dficult years ahead as we recover from the pandemic."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-seafood-fishing-extra-support-announced-industries","story":"A new pound. million funding package will offer support to fishermen, seafood businesses, ports and harbours, the Scottish Government has announced.The package includes pound. million for the Seafood Producers Resilience Fund to provide support to eligible shellfish catchers and producers, in addition to trout farmers who have faced issues exporting to the EU.:Seafood protesters fined after London Brexit demonstrationA further pound million is available to support the investment plans of ports and harbours faced with a loss of income through landing fees and pound, has been awarded to the Fishermenrsquos Mission for the welfare and emergency support activities to held workers in hardship.Fisheries Secretary Fergus Ewing said: ldquoIn the absence of any further clarity on resilience funding from the UK Government, we are stepping in to support the industry and coastal communities across Scotland and ensuring we meet the emergency needs of crews by providing welfare support through the Fishermenrsquos Mission.ldquoIn addition to this funding, last week we also supported calls for a new dedicated task force, and announced funding for two new experts to help businesses navigate the new processes and requirements.ldquoBoth shellfish and trout businesses who have faced losses due to Covid- hospitality closures across Europe are now losing products or facing additional costs due to border disruption and new non-tarf barriers.ldquoItrsquos not just exporting, we know this has serious knock-on effects that ripples right through the supply chain from boats struggling to land at ports to not being able to sell their catch.:Iain Macwhirter: Like a fish, Scotlands Crown Office is rotting from the head downldquoThe fund for shellfish and trout businesses will help the sector survive the ongoing loss of domestic sales due to Covid- and the current immediate challenges of Brexit, giving them some breathing space and allowing businesses to make the changes they need to adapt to the new, tougher, trading realities.According to the government, the Scottish seafood industryrsquos exports accounted for % of the countryrsquos overall food exports in , worth an estimated pound. billion.Responding to the announcement, chief executive of trade body Seafood Scotland, Donna Fordyce, said: ldquoThe Scottish Government has listened to industry pleas for support over the last four weeks and has really stepped up by offering such a comprehensive package.ldquoThis will have a tangible impact on the livelihoods of some of the hardest hit in the sector and in some cases could save generations-old businesses from going under.ldquoWith applications to the fund set to open as early as next week, wersquore confident that businesses will start to see the support they need very soon.Details of the Seafood Producers Resilience Fund will be published on the Marine Scotland section of the Scottish Government website from Friday February ."},{"url":null,"title":"puberty-blockers-study-found-majority-children-happier-treatment","story":"Research involving  young people aged -

However, there is still some way to go before our inter-island service is of a standard we see where in Scotland.#Orkney SNP candidate for the Scottish Parliament elections Robert Leslie said that the additional funding was brilliant news for the islands. He said: “This delivers on the fairer ferry funding calls that have been made by Lib Dems and the local authority and shows that the SNP government is in full listening mode when it comes to island issues.“I look forward to these enhanced services and reduced fares being put in place. The next step will be to engage further with the local authority and other parties on the replacement of Orkney’s ancient internal ferry fleet.”SNP MSP for the Highlands and Islands Maree Todd added: “The additional £.m in funding for inter-island ferries is a positive development and delivers on a key ask from local authority partners at a time of unprecedented financial pressure on the Scottish budget.“Whilst it is the local authority that is wholly responsible for the ferry services they provide, the SNP Government is sympathetic to the financial pressures which fall on inidual local authorities, which we know have been heightened as a result of COVID-.#She added: “It’s worth pointing out that for a long time, local authorities received no funding from the Scottish Government to support inter-island ferries, it is only under the SNP that this has changed and increased over the years. Today, we have a pledge to meet the revenue ask in full, fulfilling the SNP government’s commitment to fair ferry funding.“Considering the draft Budget meets a key ask from the Liberal Democrats, I hope to see the party get behind the budget and support it through Parliament.”Orkney#s MSP, Liberal Democrat Liam McArthur said: “This additional funding for our leline internal ferry services is undoubtedly welcome. Having been promised ‘fair funding’ by the First Minister since the last election, it’s remarkable how the prospect of an upcoming election concentrates the minds of SNP ministers.“Welcome too is the proposal to fund RET on internal ferry services. Some of these are amongst the most expensive routes mile-for-mile anywhere in the country.“Given we are still waiting for RET on Pentland Firth routes three years after it was due to be introduced and  years after it was introduced on west coast routes, it may be premature to celebrate just yet.“Of course, this will not stop SNP politicians from being first in the queue to pat themselves on the back. Let’s not forget, however, that Orkney has consistently been short-changed on ferry funding over the course of this parliament since the promises made at the last election.“There is a strong argument for the millions in under-funding now to be repaid. Indeed, it is a case SNP ministers themselves have been making to the UK Government over VAT payments for Police Scotland. If it’s good enough for police funding, it’s good enough for ferry funding.”The co-covener of the Orkney Greens, Councillor Steve Sankey welcomed the #long overdue# news.#The Scottish Greens won an additional £.million for Orkney’s ferries out of the budget settlement in , and this time around the Scottish Government has finally got there itself, after years of pressure from the three island councils involved and opposition parties,# Councillor Sankey said.“We’ve been saying for years that the knock-on effect of having to fund the deficit in ferry funding has impacted on us here greatly, and has precipitated budgetary pressures throughout Orkney. We emphasised that the situation was grossly unfair, particularly when compared to the huge increases in funding afforded to Calmac out west. The news that OIC will receive £. million next year is a relief, and will enable improvements in service such as Sunday sailings to the outer isles.#Councillor Sankey concluded: “Fairness with funding is all we’ve ever asked for, and now  years after Road Equivalent Tarf was first piloted, it seems that it will also finally be rolled out on our internal routes, although there is still no mention of the Pentland Firth.“Whilst this is good news, it now means that we turn our attention to the replacement process for our ancient ferry fleet which ranges in age from  to  years. It’s essential that any replacement proposals commit to a renewable fuel component, be it hydrogen, ammonia or electric, so that we can greatly reduce the high carbon emissions that afflict our marine transport sector.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That has led to unproven allegations that it may have a link to the original outbreak of Covid- in Wuhan in late .China has strongly denied that possibility and has promoted theories that the virus may have originated where or even been brought into the country from overseas with imports of frozen seafood tainted with the virus, a notion roundly rejected by international scientists and agencies.The institutersquos deputy director is Shi Zhengli, a virologist who worked with Peter Daszak, a zoologist on the WHO team mission, to track down the origins of SARS that originated in China and led to the  outbreak.She has published widely in academic journals and worked to debunk theories espoused by the former Trump administration and other American officials that the virus is either a bioweapon or a ldquolab leak from the institute.Following two weeks in quarantine, the WHO team that includes experts from  nations has visited hospitals, research institutes and a traditional wet market linked to many of the first cases. Their visit followed months of negotiations as China seeks to retain tight control over information about the outbreak and the investigation into its origins, possibly to avoid blame for alleged missteps in its early response.Confirmation of the origins of the virus is likely to take years. Pinning down an outbreakrsquos animal reservoir typically requires exhaustive research including taking animal samples, genetic analysis and epidemiological studies. One possibility is that a wildle poacher might have passed the virus to traders who carried it to Wuhan.The first clusters of Covid- were detected in Wuhan in late , prompting the government to put the city of  million under a strict -day lockdown. China has since reported more than , cases and , deaths, with new cases largely concentrated in its frigid northeast and local lockdowns and travel restrictions being imposed to contain the outbreaks.New cases of local transmission continue to fall with just  reported on Wednesday as Chinese heed government calls not to travel for the Lunar New Year holiday later this month.copy -.

But in , one year after the ruling junta brutally suppressed a pro-democracy uprising, military leaders suddenly changed its name to Myanmar.By then, Burma was an international pariah, desperate for any way to improve its image. Hoping for a sliver of international legitimacy, it said it was discarding a name handed down from its colonial past and to foster ethnic unity. The old name, officials said, excluded the countryrsquos many ethnic minorities. vw,vw,px, px\"Aung San Suu Kyi seen visiting a hospital last week At home, though, it changed nothing. In the Burmese language, ldquoMyanmar is simply the more formal version of ldquoBurma. The countryrsquos name was changed only in English.It was linguistic sleight-of-hand, but few people were fooled. Much of the world showed defiance of the junta by refusing to use the new name.A little over a decade ago, the country began a stumbling semi-democratic transition. The military retained extensive political power, but opposition leaders were freed from prison and house arrest, and elections were allowed. Longtime pro-democracy activist Ms Suu Kyi became the countryrsquos civilian leader.Over the years, many countries and news outlets had begun using the countryrsquos official name. As repression eased and international opposition to the military became less vocal, Myanmar became increasingly common. Inside the country, opposition leaders made clear it didnrsquot matter much anymore. vw,vw,px, px\"US President Joe Biden has pointedly continued to call the country Burma this week Unlike most of the world, the US government still officially uses ldquoBurma, but even Washington has mellowed its stance.In , during a visit to the country, then-President Barack Obama used both Burma and Myanmar. An adviser to Myanmarrsquos president called that ldquovery positive and said it was an ldquoacknowledgement of Myanmarrsquos government.Washingtonrsquos response to the coup seemed designed to highlight old criticisms, with both Secretary of State Antony Blinken and President Joe Biden pointedly avoiding the countryrsquos legal name.ldquoThe United States removed sanctions on Burma over the past decade based on progress toward democracy, Mr Biden said in a statement. ldquoThe reversal of that progress will necessitate an immediate review of our sanction laws.Most other countries, though, continued to call it Myanmar.copy -.

In the islands, Highland and rural areas and villages across the country, BBs and self-catering properties are often the only tourism accommodation, and the spend by their guests supports these fragile economies.“The business owners on today’s webinar were understandably very concerned that the poorly-drafted ‘Short-Term Lets’ licensing legislation would be hugely onerous to microbusinesses in Skye and right across Scotland and would be a catastrophic ‘double whammy’ after these very same, small family businesses have been so disproportionately hit by Covid-.”SkyeConnect maintain that the fees for licensing accommodation with the council could be as high as £, per business. that the process to determine the fees has not been completed, and urged those affected to respond to the Parliamentary consultation before the cut-off date of this Friday. The draft regulations, published just before Christmas, will then be considered by the Local Government and Communities Committee.A spokeswoman added: “The fees are not proposed to be the subject of a statutory instrument but instead are at the discretion of each local authority to set. However, the fees must be set to ensure they are sufficient to cover the local authority’s administrative expenses.“In order to calculate this, it requires work to be carried out with our finance department as to the cost of processing and determining a licence taking into account income vs expenditure. It also requires to take into account the cost of resourcing the new licensing regime including factors such as recruiting additional staff, building and IT costs.“In terms of setting dfering levels of fees, this also needs to be assessed based on whether the processing of these applications will take longer, ie be more costly to administer.“This is an ongoing exercise and ultimately cannot be completed until the draft Regulations are finalised and we know for certain what types of letting premises will or will not be included within the licensing regime. Once this is known, it will require a paper to go to the Licensing Committee on the setting of fees for their determination.” she had “raised the concerns of constituents# with the Housing Minister Kevin Stewart. She also stressed the importance of responding to the consultation.She added: “I fully understand the concern of those across Skye and Lochalsh. In particular, I realise that the tourism industry has been through the most awful time. To that end, the deadlines associated with this have been extended to April  so that the sector has some breathing space. The purpose of the licensing scheme is a set of mandatory standards which apply to all short-term lets and I imagine that the vast majority of hosts already comply with all of these standards – and more.”A working group is currently being established to develop guidance, she said, and there will “definitely be a representative from the BB sector, as well as self-catering to “influence, inform and shape” that guidance.She also maintained that the Scottish BB Association responded to both Scottish Government consultations on the issue, in  and , and were “clear that they were in favour of levelling the playing field between BBs and properties listed on s such as Airbnb.”Ms Forbes added: “In terms of fees, there has been much concern about fees of several thousand points. The Scottish Government has not specied the specic fee level that local authorities should charge, and there is scope for local authorities to consider setting dferent fees for dferent types of short-term lets.“As the MSP for Skye and Lochalsh I will ensure that the concerns of SkyeConnect and others are passed on to those steering the legislation through parliament.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CARBOST-SHOP-1.jpg","title":"community purchase secures future for carbost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe project was delayed due to the first covid lockdown and since then the Carbost Community Shop Community Interest Company has been working hard to organise the legal side of the purchase.: “We are so pleased that everything has gone through at last and the current owner, Sharon Thacker, has been so supportive and patient during the whole process.

Officials recommended approval.A motion tabled by Skye councillor John Gordon to reject the application was seconded and supported by Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and fellow Skye councillor Calum MacLeod. It was defeated by eight votes to six.A statement on behalf of a number of Stein locals opposed to the Morgans’ development said: “Obviously, the community is shocked and deeply disappointed at the decision made at planning committee yesterday.“It is widely felt that what we are seeing is the result of a planning system that is broken. A system that has lost all integrity of intention and total collapse in community trust and respect. Everyone is talking about it.“It would seem, that a system of double standards exists, where one set of rules apply to the long-standing residents and a dferent set for the speculative, corporate developer who demonstrates no understanding interest or empathy for local heritage or the community they impose their developments on.“The progress of this application through planning has totally failed to uphold the objective of the conservation area and fails to recognise the importance of the setting of the listed building. Neither does it take account of the numerous natural heritage and wildle issues raised.”Approving the application “makes a mockery of the term conservation area and neither does the proposal comply with the terms” of Highland Council’s own local plan, the statement said.It added: “From the moment this application, with very signicant potential for detrimental impact, was accepted into the system amidst the strictest part of the pandemic lockdown, it has been felt that it sought to subvert the right of the local community to fair comment.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/James-Rebanks-and-dogs-credit-Andrew-Heading-edited.jpg","title":"we can learn a lot from old henry of the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineHis debut book, ‘It’s A Shepherd’s Le’ — which I stumbled on by accident— went on to become a best-seller.It’s a wonderfully evocative account of the massive challenges and privilege of being a hill farmer in the fells of the Lake District.Like all good writing, it doesn’t feel like reading you are just taken on an effortless journey of the imagination.I’ve never been to the Lake District myself, but from all accounts it’s quite spectacular — a bit like our own Highlands — and Rebanks captures that vividly.But what comes across more than anything is the sense of privilege he feels from being connected to the land, the massive challenges of trying to make a living from a harsh environment and his profound sadness that a way of le which was once the bedrock of rural communities is now fast disappearing. The parallels to our own circumstances is quite striking.His second offering, ‘English Pastoral’, offers a bit more optimism. Once again it’s a tremendously easy read and we are back on the fells, among the distinctive Herdwick sheep, the cattle, the characters — in particular his grandfather whose farm he inherited —and the drystone dykes. Except this time we are offered a lesson, and it is one that should make us sit up and take notice.Through charting the history of his home valley, Rebanks shows how agricultural practices have changed over the course of time and goes on to explain how similar trends have taken place throughout the UK and, indeed, across the globe.After the Second World War, governments rigorously pursued policies of producing more and more food. Farmers were offered huge subsidies and incentives, so farms became bigger, semi unproductive land improved through mechanisation and modern practices, and on and on the juggernaut ploughed.Then came the supermarkets. Their over-riding aim was to drive down prices, so farms had to become more efficient. Economies of scale became the mantra. Traditional family farms disappeared, swallowed up by larger businesses, machines became bigger and more expensive and farmers became captains of industry and capitalists.None of this happened overnight, of course, but it is heartbreaking to read of the struggles of the Rebanks’ own traditional family farm, trying to stay afloat financially while competing with the drive for modernisation going on all around them. The le of a hill farmer —or crofter for that matter — can seem romantic, but the reality is often very dferent.Eventually, Rebanks’ father had an epiphany – and it was something that the younger ones had also realised. And it was all to do with ‘Old Henry’.Old Henry was a neighbouring farmer, an eccentric bachelor. As all those around him invested in new machinery and chemical fertilisers, Old Henry never bothered, or even seemed to care.He just continued in his own stubborn way, farming the way it had been done for generations with native breeds of livestock, cutting hay well into the autumn , thistle and weeds adorning every nook and cranny and his old stone barns more a haven for birdle than serving any useful practical purpose.Rebanks always used to take more than a passing glance at this farm. With its vast array of wildle and ancient practices, it reminded him of the way his grandfather’s farm used to be.When Old Henry passed away, the inevitable happened and the farm was broken up and sold to larger businesses. The agronomists came with their scientic degrees to survey the land and assess what inputs were required to transform this antiquated model into profitable production. Their conclusion astounded them: never before had they seen soil so healthy. It required not a jot of chemical input.And here’s the crux of the lesson: Old Henry was onto something, whether knowingly or not. And the Rebanks were to take heed.Over the course of time, as the drive for greater efficiency became ever more necessary, farmers began to specialise in one or maybe two products – whether that was focusing on huge livestock numbers or on a particular crop. Traditional mixed rotation became a thing of the past. It was seen as unnecessary, as chemical fertilisers and pesticides could ensure continued productivity and profitability.But, through time, it all led, perhaps inevitably, to the destruction of the soil and natural environment. The evidence was there all along, but perhaps no-one had the time or inclination to see. The farmland birds — the curlew, the lapwing, the corncrake — were disappearing the earthworms, such a crucial indicator of soil health, non-existent. ‘Modernisation’ had come at a very heavy price indeed.And so the Rebanks family began to reassess. Fast-forward to today and their family hill farm now derives part of its income from subsidies geared towards environmental improvement: from the hedgerows planted, the trees, the fenced off waterways, from ious bits of wildle havens dotted around the farm.But, be under no mistake, this is still very much a working livestock business, just that the main enterprise is now dove-tailed with nature and bioersity, just as it once was through natural occurrence back in his grandfather’s day.There is a growing realisation that this is the way forward for agriculture and land use – and might even be a way of getting the wider populace to warmly embrace the countryside once again.Due to simple economics and geography, a lot of the ‘modernisation’ of which the book speaks passed crofting by, so who knows maybe we could be in the vanguard of this new agricultural and land-use enlightenment – given the proper vision and the right political will, of course.As Old Henry of the fells so ably demonstrated in his own idiosyncratic way, there’s a lot to be said for the old ways. Maybe it is time to re-connect with the past."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/363-Katherine-Dix-Ceit-at-spinning-wheel-outside-Nissen-Cottage-from-Alison-Dix-daughter-via-EM.jpg","title":"traditional journey of the swelling","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSometimes we can follow the journey of a specic story by comparing earlier texts from the great collections of the th century with later recordings, especially those in the School of Scottish Studies archives available online at the digital archive Tobar an Dualchais. We catch characters, plots and inidual episodes changing to reflect new environments, audiences and times as each version is transported by the carrying stream.How a story changes informs us about the people who tell them – their culture, beliefs, and worldview. A setting may be changed to make a story more appealing to a local audience. An episode may be omitted because it isn’t seen to be relevant – or because it is too sensitive. The same story may be repeated because it is an effective warning: be wary of the wilderness lying beyond our township’s boundary.With the help of Tobar an Dualchais, we can follow one story’s journey from Highland moor to the island of Hearmatraigh, near North Uist, in real-time. Folklorists call this kind of story a migratory legend: where the same type of story is told in dferent areas, but with dferent settings and characters, localised where it is told.Catherine Dix, or Ceit an Tàilleir, was a remarkable storyteller who contributed hundreds of items to the School of Scottish Studies Archives. Born in , Ceit spent her early le in Beàrnaraigh, before moving away for work on the mainland at the age of . After a prolonged time away, she ed with her family to the island at the start of World War Two. She was recorded extensively during the s and s.One traditional story features a shepherd and his dog who stay in a shieling overnight. A hag arrives to warm herself by the fire. She swells to the size of a peat-stack, remarking that it’s only her ‘plumage’ rising with the heat. The hag attacks the shepherd but is driven away by the dog. The story is often called ‘m’ iteagan is m’ oiteagan’ : the phrase appears in most iants of this tale.Ceit recorded the story on at least three occasions in  , and with Iain Paterson , himself a native of Beàrnaraigh employed as a collector for the School of Scottish Studies. The  recording is transcribed in the excellent  publication by Ceit’s granddaughter, Alison – Ceit an Tàilleir.Ceit clearly enjoyed telling the story, but during a decade of performances it changed its setting: from a nondescript Highland moor in , to an unnamed island in , and finally to Hearmatraigh in . A story, originally set on the mainland, is gradually reworked by the storyteller, perhaps to make it more appealing to an island audience.It’s in the nature of migratory legends to change – it’s what makes it easier for them to migrate in the first place. But can we also trace where the story came from  Where did Ceit first hear her story: in Beàrnaraigh, or where Folklore recorders are trained to ask about where tradition comes from. At the end of every story, Iain Paterson would ask Ceit where she heard the story. In , she mentioned her father, Archibald Macleodfrom Baile Mhàrtainn in North Uist. But in the  recording she offered an extra explanation: the story in fact came from Archie MacColl of Ardtur in Appin, where she worked on a farm between the ages of  and  years. Paterson, clearly intrigued, asks how the story came to be set in Hearmatraigh. Ceit replied that Archie MacColl had heard the story from a boy from the Outer Hebrides who was working for him.It’s interesting that Ceit maintained here that the story was set in Hearmatraigh in both versions she heard – the one from her father and the one she heard as a teenager working in Appin. In her first recording she had set the tale in the Highlands.By comparing this story and its episodes to similar ‘migratory legends’, we can try to trace how it might have spread. The villain of Ceit’s story is the ‘swelling hag’. This redoubtable character is met with in a type of traditional story that once was told across Eurasia. It is known by folklorists as ‘The Two Brothers’.In the Scottish Gàidhealtachd, we have a version of ‘The Two Brothers’ recorded in Beàrnaraigh. It is called ‘Cailleach na Riobaig’and was collected in  for John Francis Campbell’s ‘Popular Tales of the West Highlands’ project. Despite similar wording between the two tales, Ceit’s story contains episodes not present in the  tale, episodes resembling other versions of the story collected on the mainland, east of Appin.On the whole, Ceit’s story is more similar to these mainland versions than anything recorded in the Outer Hebrides. Although she told Iain Paterson in  that both versions of the story she had heard were set in Hearmatraigh, it may be that, to make the story more attractive to an island audience, Ceit deliberately relocated an originally mainland story to the Sound of Harris. This comes through in the changing setting of her three versions of the story.But why Hearmatraigh  In relocating her story, Ceit chose a location which preserved the kind of setting in the original mainland story. She keeps the shieling, an outpost of civilisation in the wilderness where many stories tell of conflicts between human society and the supernatural.Hearmatraigh might have been chosen as it was one of the principal islands where Beàrnaraigh folk would stay in shielings for short periods to hunt, fish, and harvest peat. One recording on Tobar an Dualchaisnotes that the bothy on Hearmatraigh was built using lime-mortar: this construction technique would have made it stand out among other island shielings built of stone and turf.The Hearmatraigh settlement was centred around the natural harbour known as An Acairseid Mhòr. It is very likely that the fishing station from the time of Charles I mentioned by the Hebridean author Martin Martinwas located here. Could the fishing station’s ruin have been later repurposed as a shieling It may be, then, that when Ceit was looking for a local setting for the story she had originally heard in Appin, moving the tale to Hearmatraigh made it more relevant and appealing to her listeners. But with this clever transfer she also skilfully preserved the cultural signicance of its original moorland setting: a place out in the wilderness where dangerous supernatural creatures could overwhelm the unwary.Ceit Dix’s stories demonstrate the richness and iety of Gaelic traditional culture and offer a glimpse of how skilled storytellers adapt and localise their tales to entertain and intrigue their dferent audiences. contains some , oral recordings of songs, music, poetry and factual information made in Scotland and further afield."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3595857.jpg--.jpg?1611825143000\n","title":"big ballymena response sought for big garden birdwatch 2021","story":"RSPB NI is hoping that more people from the Ballymena area than ever will celebrate their love of nature and unite to count garden birds at the end of January for the annual Big Garden Birdwatch.In the past year, it’s been clear to see how important the natural world is to everyone’s mental health and wellbeing. There has been a surge in interest in the nature on our doorsteps and many people have come to rely on garden birds to bring joy and comfort in these unsettling times. This year’s event takes place on Friday , Saturday  and Sunday  January. People are being asked to spend just one hour watching and recording the birds in their garden, then send their results to the RSPB. Close to half a million people join in the Birdwatch every year across the UK. Just under , people from Northern Ireland took part last year.Anne-Marie McDevitt, RSPB NI Head of Species, said: “With more people having to stay at home over the past year, everyone has been spending more time outdoors and in gardens and I think as a result have been noticing nature more and having more time to engage with it.“Last year people were asking usmore birds were singing during the lockdown, but it’s not that there has been more wildle about it’s just that we’ve had more time and space to notice it.“By taking part in the Big Garden Birdwatch, you are helping to build an annual snapshot of how our birdle is doing. It is only by us understanding how our wildle is faring that we can protect it. We’ve noticed that more people have signed up now for the Birdwatch than had at this stage last year, which is fantastic. We know that nature is in crisis and together we can all take action to solve the problems facing it. Nature needs us.”Just one hour every year for the last four decades has made the RSPB’s Big Garden Birdwatch the world’s largest garden wildle citizen science project. Now in its nd year,  million birds have been counted. Last year’s results showed that house sparrows remained at the top of the Big Garden Birdwatch rankings in Northern Ireland, with an average of almost five sparrows being spotted in gardens. Collared doves flew into the top , replacing coal tits, while sightings of goldfinches and robins were up too.While counties Down and Tyrone both had the same top two in  , starlings were the most-spotted birds in counties Antrim, Armagh and Derry-Londonderry – ahead of house sparrows – while Fermanagh’s number one bird was the chaffinch.Big Garden Birdwatch continues to highlight the winners and losers in the garden bird world. While house sparrows and starlings may be the UK’s most commonly sighted birds, a closer look at Big Garden Birdwatch data shows that numbers have dropped dramatically since the Birdwatch began in . House sparrows are down %, while starlings are down %. It’s a pattern echoed by two more garden favourites, with blackbirds and robins down % and % respectively.

I have always been clear that the furlough and the self-employed schemes are essential and must remain in place until there are clear signs of economic recovery.“Since last March, I have lobbied hard with national government on this issue and I will continue to do so. It is vital workers across Northern Ireland must be able to access the support they need, not just to protect their livelihoods now, but to be in a position to plan ahead towards recovery with some degree of certainty.“It is so important that we get infections under control and allow people and business to get back to work as soon as is feasible in order to begin the process of recovery. However, these figures demonstrate that too many workers are still reliant on this essential support. Therefore it is too early to consider stopping it.“That is why I am calling on the Chancellor to extend both schemes beyond the end of April .”According to HMRC figure, Northern Ireland has a % take-up rate on the CJRS of eligible employments as at  December. This is as increase on the % take-up rate at the end of September.Around , self-employed iniduals in Northern Ireland had claimed the third SEISS grant up to  December , totalling poundm.

When you are driving, your focus should be on the road and what other road users are doing, free from any distraction. “Our figures clearly indicate that driver distraction, together with inappropriate speed, drink and drug driving are consistently the main causes of the most serious crashes which kill and injure people on roads across Northern Ireland.

In line with the Department of Health’s twin track approach to accelerate vaccinations, both the online system and telephone booking line can be used by those in the - age group to make an appointment at one of the seven regional vaccination centres. While demand for vaccination slots is high, people are reminded that there will be enough appointments for everyone in the group so please remain patient. In the last five days the online booking system has been used to make , appointments. People are asked to reserve capacity on the telephone booking linefor those who cannot avail of the online booking facility. Where possible we would encourage booking appointments online. It is also anticipated that demand for telephone bookings will initially be very high. Therefore,you cannot get through initially, please be patient and try again later. Call volumes tend to be lower later in the day. If you can’t get through immediately then try again. The service is available from Monday to Friday .am to .pm. To fall within the - age bracket you must have been born between  April  and  March . Age and identity checks will be conducted at the vaccination centres. People outside the relevant age group should not misuse the online or telephone booking facility. Misuse will only make it more dficult for those to get through who are being prioritised because of their clinical vulnerability. GPs will be working in parallel to the regional vaccination centres and will focus on the  plus age group. This group cannot use this booking facility. GPs will make contact with their patients in this age group, therefore people do not need to phone their GP practice.

Business support was a key topic, and it was devastating to hear Tina McKenzie, Chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, discuss the hardships being faced and demonstrating the very bleak outlook for many businesseswe do not find a way forward both in terms of the handling of the pandemic,but also enhancing the support available to these businesses. The impact on business is substantial and that on each of their employees is devastating. Furlough has been a hottopic during this lockdown and as we have seen business vilied for not looking atrestructures, she reminded us of the fact that whilst the support available is welcomed, itremains far from enough to enable survival. I recently received an email from a local politician who stated, “I’m in awe you are still in business”. While this could be accepted as a compliment, this is far from the support andvoice a small business like mine requires or is looking for, and this was conveyed to them. The business community needs a clear voice with a key message and desire, rather than noise. These voices, like Tina, work tirelessly to press the government to step in with moresupport, minimising their costs and contribution while revenues are non-existent, and Iapplaud them for doing so. With news breaking this week that there is still pound million remaining in the Stormont COVID “pot” to be allocated towards businesses before March, I would urge Diane Doddsand Conor Murphy to listen to businesses and their representatives to ensure businessessurvive. It would be truly shamefulthis money had to be ed to Westminster as a result of poor planning and slow reactions, while local businesses are making very dficultdecisions due to lack of financial support which clearly is available, but not utilised. With financial survival for businesses and more importantly each of us as iniduals and our families the sole aim, Tina succinctly reminded us that our elected representatives should beheld to account, not the businesses themselves. The Sunday Times recently reported that the public feels more frightened now than at any time before with % of voters feeling ‘personally threatened’ by COVID. It also reportedthat Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have agreed on a ‘recovery plan’ to save jobs. The realityis however, thatthey and our own Executive do not deliver this strategy correctly, without delay or U-turn, the job market will constrict further. Many professional trade bodies arereporting that their members don’t have enough in the bank until April and judging bynumerous reports this past week, lockdown and on-going restrictions are likely to extend beyond April. How can businesses be expected to survive without this  We all have a voice, but not all of us use it. As a business community we need vocal and active business leaders to speak out to help fight our case. A great demonstrative exampleof this is the great work of my good friend Brian Donaldson from Excluded NI. Throughout,Brian has spoken out and acted to help thousands who have been financially excluded with no support being provided to them. Brian had established himself as newly self-employedchef just before lockdown, only to find that as support packages were announced, he quickly found himself excluded from all government support offered. With a family, and amortgage to pay, Brian created a  for his case to constructively find a resolution forall those who found themselves in the same situation. By working closely with local politicians, Brian, has researched and submitted proposals to the Department for the Economy with numerous resolutions and proposals to deliver financialassistance to these groups, which has resulted in thousands, including Ltd Company directors,eventually being awarded some financial support. Brian continues daily to ensure the excluded have a voice and shows how being a voice can bring about change! As a business owner, I send a huge thank you to all the hard-working professional trade bodies and voices for our communities, who throughout this time have worked tirelessly toensure we all have all have a business toto in the future. If you, like so many, are in adficult situation, be sure to reach out to your local business trade body today to highlight your plight and use their voices as much as you can. We all need as much support andsurvival mechanism as possible. It’s evident that the more voices there are and the louderthey become successful outcomes can be delivered. I will wrap up by leaving you with a well-known quote by Napoleon Bonaparte: ‘Ten people who speak make more noise than ten thousand who are silent’. Until next week, stay safe!

Before the UK left the EU, Johnsons of Whixley sold £, of plants to Northern Ireland customers every year.The company said new and impractical restrictions had hampered long-standing trading relationships.Plants which originate from a bare root young plant, or those that have had any contact with the soil, evencontainer grown, are considered a risk because of the likely legacy of soil residue, which has the potential to carry pathogens or nematodes, Johnsons said.While not impossible, soil residue removal is impractical and would defeat the point of rootballing and containerisation.Long-standing customers of Johnsons and many other nurseries are left with no choice but to go directly to EU suppliers because there are no restrictions on legacy soil residue between EU members or affiliates in the guise of Northern Ireland. Johnsons head of production and procurement Jonathan Whittemore said: This legislation penalises UK growers and gives an immediate competitive advantage to EU suppliers, who may go on to monopolise supply into an existing part of the UK at the expense of our business and the wider industry.Belfast Most ReadPSNI investigate footage of #sinister# group of masked men patrolling east Belfast streetsMurder probe launched as man gunned down on Belfast roadProfessor Ian Young#s role in fight against virus questionedCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and  new cases reportedDUP#s support takes a e in wake of Irish sea border rowLatest Northern IrelandBelfast Black Santa appeal raises £, in spite of Covid restrictionsBelfast kebab shop fined for poor hygieneBelfast couple#s row during sex led to meat cleaver attack, court toldTyrone author Pheme#s novel new career inspired by tour of battlefieldsLatest from Belfast O#Connell: I couldn#t pass up chance to inspire IrishDeclan BogueOpinionRural clubs in urgent danger without helpBelfast Black Santa appeal raises £, in spite of Covid restrictionsBelfast kebab shop fined for poor hygieneBelfast couple#s row during sex led to meat cleaver attack, court told,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Joanna has been a good friend to me and a great supporter of Children in Crossfire, both of which mean a great deal to me.She has also built a great rapport with Derry and many of its people,and I look forward to tuning in to Home Sweet Home to see our city at its best.Mr Moore praised the efforts of the man who painted the mural, Karl Porter from UV Arts, who said: When first approached about the project I was over the moon, the chance to celebrate one of Derry#s greatest living heroes, Richard Moore, someone who has dedicated his le to helping others.The image we have used is iconic, showing the Dalai Lama#s deep spirituality as well as his admiration for Richard Moore.If you look closely, the shape of the heads and the Dalai Lama#s embrace - forms the shape of a heart, a simple yet subtle way to celebrate the connections between these two iniduals.The image we have used is iconic, showing the Dalai Lama#s deep spirituality as well as his admiration for Richard Moore.I hope it will attract locals and visitors alike for many years to come and a poignant new addition to our street art movement in the city.Belfast Most ReadPSNI investigate footage of #sinister# group of masked men patrolling east Belfast streetsMurder probe launched as man gunned down on Belfast roadProfessor Ian Young#s role in fight against virus questionedCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and  new cases reportedDUP#s support takes a e in wake of Irish sea border rowLatest Northern IrelandBelfast Black Santa appeal raises £, in spite of Covid restrictionsBelfast kebab shop fined for poor hygieneBelfast couple#s row during sex led to meat cleaver attack, court toldTyrone author Pheme#s novel new career inspired by tour of battlefieldsArson: Police investigate two attacks in CookstownLatest from Belfast Brexit rules made nursery stop supplying Northern IrelandBelfast Black Santa appeal raises £, in spite of Covid restrictionsBelfast kebab shop fined for poor hygieneBelfast couple#s row during sex led to meat cleaver attack, court toldTyrone author Pheme#s novel new career inspired by tour of battlefields,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

other than a race to ensure that everyone is vaccinated globally to protect those who are most vulnerable from this virus - including those in low-income countries.“That’s why the global effort to ensure the vaccine gets to those countries is crucially important and the UK’s playing a very signicant role in that.”Read MoreVaccinated people must continue social distancing, warns chief medical officerHe continued: “In terms of summer holidays, no vaccine is % effective, even a % effective vaccine means that % of people are not protected.“There is no way of knowing those who are protected from those who are not protected. “What we hope with these vaccines is that even those who are not fully protected will get some protection from severe disease,indeed they become infected.“Because we know that evena vaccine doesn’t prevent you getting disease,you get disease, in many instances it can alter the severity of that disease and you may get a milder illness.Dr McBride added: “It’s an inidual choice and people will make up their own minds and it’s probably too early to be planning for the summer just at this stage.” Read MoreArmagh and Mid Ulster retain highest new infection numbersCovid-: Almost a year since the first case was detected in Northern Ireland,what have we learned Belfast Most ReadPSNI investigate footage of #sinister# group of masked men patrolling east Belfast streetsCommunity in shock as man shot dead in Belfast gun attackProfessor Ian Young#s role in fight against virus questionedDUP#s support takes a e in wake of Irish sea border rowCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and  new cases reportedLatest Northern IrelandDual access to markets #attracting companies to Northern Ireland#Winter warning: cold and blustery conditions set to continuePSNI#s top female officer #not the last to head for exit door# Derry man#s bond with Dalai Lama inspires mural and TV documentaryTeenager starts campaign for Derry detox centre after mum#s tragic deathLatest from Belfast Dual access to markets #attracting companies to Northern Ireland#Winter warning: cold and blustery conditions set to continuePSNI#s top female officer #not the last to head for exit door# Derry man#s bond with Dalai Lama inspires mural and TV documentaryTeenager starts campaign for Derry detox centre after mum#s tragic death,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Many companies are looking at how they operate their global footprint post-Covid.He cited a company with a centre in the Philippines that was forced to shut after restrictions were introduced as an example of the kind of firm that may consider setting up here.Northern Ireland did an amazing job with resilience in Covid and has some amazing opportunities with access to these markets, Mr Holland added.He also revealed Invest NI had held conversations with industrial and technology firms.

A further one in  also had a bumpy start to their love lives between the ages of  and  and described their first smooch as somewhat unpleasant. Half said their memories were vague.But a quarter of respondents told Hastings Hotels, who carried out the survey, that their first kiss was really good, with almost one in  remembering it in exact detail - where it was, what they were wearing and the music being played at the time. It is an element of romance most are hoping to recreate on Valentine#s Day this year as they try to make the most of the day in lockdown, despite missing opportunities for a night away, alone time or a meal in a restaurant with their other half. There were , respondents to the survey north and south, where half said they missed hotel stays the most in lockdown, with almost three in  saying they missed romantic mealsand one in  said they just wanted to be alone with their partner . But three in  said they were planning to go the extra mile to celebrate despite Northern Ireland being bound by restrictions until at least March . Cooking a special dinner is the gesture of choice for almost half , while four in  said they#d choose a hotel break to look forward to after lockdown. Just over % intend to buy flowers.Duane Farrell, CEO of Relate NI, said how you should celebrate all depends on your love language. Relationships are an essential foundation to our health and wellbeing so it#s great to see that survey respondents plan to make an extra effort this year as relationship maintenance is important, he said. We all receive love in dferent ways, with the five main love languages being words of affirmation, acts of service, receiving gts, quality time and physical touch.These love languages allow us to give and receive love in the ways we want, he said.For the one in  in the survey who are craving alone time with their partner, it may be that quality time is their preferred love language, he said. They may like ittheir partner carved out some alone time with them for a walk or to play a board game, as opposed to receiving flowers and chocolates.The upcoming celebrations are not easy for everyone, with many singletonsplanning on spending the holiday alone saying they felt lonely and wished they had a partner in lockdown. Fteen per cent of respondents, most of whom were men, said they were now trying online dating for the first time. Mr Farrell said not to feel worried by the prospect of a solo Valentine#s Day.Our relationship with our self is the most important one we have, so make some time on February  to check in with yourself and de-stress, he advised.Not all single people are eager to meet someone, with almost three in said there is less pressure due to the pandemic. Over half of Northern Ireland respondentsbelieve Valentine#s Day is special and more than six in  men and women believe that they are romantic. Julie Hastings from the hotel group said it is heartening to see. Like so many special occasions we#ve had to miss, we#re making the most of the situation, either by cooking a special meal or booking a break away for later, she said.

This newspaper understands there are not women coming up behind them in sufficient numbers.Former ACC Alan McQuillan told the Belfastthat the PSNI faces huge challenges in attracting quality applicants from outside.It#s a great move for Barbara and we may well see her back again as a future potential chief, Mr McQuillan said.She#s gone to London on promotion to get experience there.When you reach that point in your career you have to make a decision: are you prepared to be mobile and go national, take a job where and then potentially come back, or do you want to stay in the one force and limit your career One of the problems here is the time it takes the [Policing] Board to fill vacancies. They need to get moving quickly to get these vacant posts filled.Very few people are willing to come across here to work because of the situation they have to work in.It has to be a better place to work. A lot of people on the outside look at the political situation here and say: #I don#t want to go there#.Police Federation chair Mark Lindsay said it was understandable that ACC Gray was moving on to the next stage in her career after  years because there would be no upward movement in Northern Ireland for the next couple of years.Such departures are concerning because, for example, in the last process for Assistant Chief Constable we couldn#t attract enough applicants for the number of posts available, he said.The Policing Board needs to look at the package on offer and the role that they#re asking ACC#s from across the water to take up.It should be a desirable job, but the constant haranguing in Northern Ireland at all levels of policing is bound to wear anybody down.People want to move on in Northern Ireland - that much is clear - and for officers, irrespective of rank, to be constantly in the middle of political storms merely undermines the job and deters people.Dolores Kelly MLA said high ranking officers often leave the PSNI for experience to further their careers, but added it was concerning it has lost its two top females in under a year.It#s a sign of the calibre and experience of police officers here that they#re offered posts at senior levels in other police services, she said.The SDLP Policing Board member added: We#re concerned about the gender imbalance and lack of ersity, particularly amongst senior ranks.It#s encouraging to see some women come through and I know the Chief Constable is committed and has a culture audit ongoing within the PSNI, which I#m looking forward to hearing the findings of.In response to the Belfast , the PSNI said officers leave the organisation for a iety of reasons, including promotion or retirement.These are personal decisions taken by those officers, it added.Whilst we are always sorry to lose senior police officers and police staff colleagues when they retire or move to alternative roles, we also welcome the opportunity that this presents for our emerging leaders.In terms of representativeness, we have recently made a number of appointments within our chief inspector, superintendent and chief superintendent ranks and it is pleasing to note the progression of female candidates within these promotion processes.We will also be welcoming our new chief operating officer Pamela McCreedy next month, and will be progressing other senior police staff opportunities across a range of specialisms in the coming months.Belfast Most ReadPSNI investigate footage of #sinister# group of masked men patrolling east Belfast streetsMurder probe launched as man gunned down on Belfast roadProfessor Ian Young#s role in fight against virus questionedCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and  new cases reportedDUP#s support takes a e in wake of Irish sea border rowLatest Northern IrelandStruggling Northern Ireland GP brands health service a #shambles#Belfast man John Connors jailed for three months after police chase Relief: Gruelling wait for exam clarity had negative impact on mental health... but better late than neverBrexit rules made top UK nursery stop supplying Northern IrelandBelfast Black Santa appeal raises £, in spite of Covid restrictionsLatest from Belfast Struggling Northern Ireland GP brands health service a #shambles#Hat-trick hero Lavery puts on a masterclassBelfast man John Connors jailed for three months after police chase Relief: Gruelling wait for exam clarity had negative impact on mental health... but better late than neverO#Connell: I couldn#t pass up chance to inspire Irish,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The relocation will bring over  undergraduate students to the Magee campus. Postgraduate Health Sciences teaching will move to the University’s Belfast campus at the same time. Announcing the relocation decision, Professor Carol Curran, Executive Dean of the Faculty of Le and Health Sciences at Ulster University explained: “Now, more than ever, in the context of a health service that continues to face sustained challenge in tackling COVID-, we are acutely aware of the vital contribution of our allied health professionals. googletag.cmd.push “The Magee campus will best enable the NHS strategic emphasis on development of multi-disciplinary teams and rich opportunities for interprofessional learning.” The programmes will be delivered alongside Magee’s new Paramedic teaching provision, and Graduate Entry School of Medicine, both of which are recruiting students for the start of the  academic year. UU’s award-winning School of Nursing which ranked th in the UK has operated in the city for  years. Magee campus also runs one of only three Nursing and Midwery Councilcompetency test centres in the UK, established to increase nursing capacity and help alleviate pressures in the health sector. googletag.cmd.push Professor Curran added: “Bringing these programmes together will open up opportunities for an interdisciplinary student learning environment, as well as building on existing research collaborations in personalised medicine and cognitive analytics based at Magee. “Belfast is the most appropriate location for postgraduate provision - supporting the existing health sciences workforce to access continued professional development, alongside our current postgraduate nursing provision. “We value the input of the healthcare stakeholders, partners, students and colleagues who contributed to the public consultation carried out and look forward to working with them as we prepare for the first cohort of students in September .” A UU spokesperson said the decision reflects the University’s unique regional mission operating across  campuses at Derry, Coleraine and Belfast   Jordanstown, enabling access to educational opportunity across Northern Ireland and supporting wider efforts to achieve better regional economic balance.     The University has made the decision following a full Equality Impact Assessment , as well as review and analysis of responses to a public consultation that closed in early December. Professor Curran concluded: “We look forward to working with our colleagues, student body, Trade Unions, all the HSC Trusts and our many partners in Derry~Londonderry to welcome students and staff to this progressive school on our beautul campus in a vibrant university city. “Together we will provide the next generation of highly skilled health professionals so urgently required to meet the needs of the healthcare workforce and patients.” The School of Health Sciences is the regional provider of most of the Allied Health Professions workforce for HSC in Northern Ireland. This includes diagnostic radiography, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, podiatry, speech and language therapy, radiotherapy and oncology, as well as healthcare scientists. Workforce planning within Health and Social Carehighlights the need for continued growth in this group of employees, the second largest in HSC. In January , the University confirmed that the relocation of allied health and health sciences provision from Jordanstown to Coleraine would be paused to enable further consideration in the light of healthcare needs, the vision for transforming healthcare to meet those demands, the growing potential for the opening of the Medical School at the Magee campus and the University’s centres of excellence in teaching and research. The School of Health Sciences will remain at Jordanstown for the   academic year to enable sufficient time for transition arrangements to the new locations.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Breandaacuten McNally died in November  after suffering from a brain tumour and his sister Aoe McNally has now launched an energetic fundraising challenge to fund research into the condition. Aoes effort comes after her brother Ruairiacute raised pound, through a birthday fundraiser, and she will be attempting to walk , steps every day during the month of February along with a number of friends. The money will go towards Brain Tumour Research, a UK-based charity dedicated to raising funds for continuous and sustainable scientic research into brain tumours. googletag.cmd.push “Research into brain tumours gets less than on percent of the national fundraising budget for cancer research and my aunt had signed a petition, so she was getting the emails,” she told the County Derry Post. “My brother had done the fundraiser for his birthday as well and she sent me on the email to seeI would want to give it a go in February. “I created the fundraiser and a load of my friends did too, and all of a sudden everyone was getting on board. I added up the other night there was over pound, raised in total already.” googletag.cmd.push The fundraiser has had a global reach. Breandy had spent time in both Australia and America, and he has left such an impression that the support has been huge. Aoe and Ruairiacute pictured with Breandaacuten in . “Breandy was that far travelled that his name has spread to all corners of the world,” said Aoe. “Its overwhelming the amount of support its received, and you dont realise how quickly it spreads. I have had people on to me from Australia and America. “I actually sat down and cried on Tuesday night because I couldnt believe how many people had donated to it. They were happy tears.     “He didnt let it get him down, he just fought on with it. One of his friends posted saying his attitude to le was an inspiration to everyone and thats true.” With such a large amount already raised, Aoe is now facing the reality of a , step marathon in the month of February. “You think , steps isnt a wile lot, but whenever youre stuck in the house and its raining outside, there arent too many places you can go to get the steps up,”she said. “In the good weather I would go walking with my mummy, butI look out and its raining, Ill usually get back into bed. “Breandy was probably the big exercise man in our family!” A donation to the fundraiser can be made by visiting Aoes , Steps Challenge Facebook page, or you can help by signing the Brain Tumour Research petition on their website.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Aoes effort comes after her brother Ruairiacute raised pound, through a birthday fundraiser, and she will be attempting to walk , steps every day during the month of February along with a number of friends. The money will go towards Brain Tumour Research, a UK-based charity dedicated to raising funds for continuous and sustainable scientic research into brain tumours. googletag.cmd.push “Research into brain tumours gets less than on percent of the national fundraising budget for cancer research and my aunt had signed a petition, so she was getting the emails,” she told the County Derry Post. “My brother had done the fundraiser for his birthday as well and she sent me on the email to seeI would want to give it a go in February. “I created the fundraiser and a load of my friends did too, and all of a sudden everyone was getting on board. I added up the other night there was over pound, raised in total already.” googletag.cmd.push The fundraiser has had a global reach. Breandy had spent time in both Australia and America, and he has left such an impression that the support has been huge. Aoe and Ruairiacute pictured with Breandaacuten in . “Breandy was that far travelled that his name has spread to all corners of the world,” said Aoe. “Its overwhelming the amount of support its received, and you dont realise how quickly it spreads. I have had people on to me from Australia and America. “I actually sat down and cried on Tuesday night because I couldnt believe how many people had donated to it. They were happy tears.     “He didnt let it get him down, he just fought on with it. One of his friends posted saying his attitude to le was an inspiration to everyone and thats true.” With such a large amount already raised, Aoe is now facing the reality of a , step marathon in the month of February. “You think , steps isnt a wile lot, but whenever youre stuck in the house and its raining outside, there arent too many places you can go to get the steps up,”she said. “In the good weather I would go walking with my mummy, butI look out and its raining, Ill usually get back into bed. “Breandy was probably the big exercise man in our family!” A donation to the fundraiser can be made by visiting Aoes , Steps Challenge Facebook page, or you can help by signing the Brain Tumour Research petition on their website.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The boat, named Day Dawn N , ran ashore on August  last year and has remained anchored to the spot ever since. The retired fishing vessel had been acquired by Nathan Ross and Druso Martinez de Riquelme with a view to mooring it at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast as an Air B ‘n’ B. However, after running into dficulty last August, those plans have been put on hold. It was initially suspected that the tide was too low to refloat the boat. googletag.cmd.push However, the owners later revealed that the bigger issue was the fact that it’s suspended over a three and a half metre crater in the mudflats. In late November, the stars seemed to align to the sailors’ delight a high tide arrived and they secured the services of marine specialists to dig a channel under the boat in order to move it to a nearby marina. The drones were out to capture the moment Day Dawn made it back to sea. Unfortunately, their efforts proved unfruitful and, according to the owners, the operation cost a substantial sum of money. There has been little to no activity around the boat since the start of this year. googletag.cmd.push The Derry News asked Foyle Portthere will come a time when it may have to intervene orit’s possible the boat could become a permanent fixture on the River Foyle landscape. In response, a spokesperson said: “The responsibility for the movement of the boat remains firmly with the owners and we would encourage them to continue to do all they can to have the vessel re-floated. “This is an unfortunate situation that they have created and now must make every effort to employ further resources to deal with this problem. “We continue to monitor the location to ensure that the vessel poses no threat to the main navigation channel, nor that it is causing any unnecessary impact to the local environment.”     The boat owners were contacted for comment but none was provided at the time of publishing.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The mural at Great James Street was created by local company UV Arts. Ahead of the broadcast of the new ITV programme Home Sweet Home, which will feature Derry in an episode airing on Tuesday, February , it has been revealed that the mural was suggested by Joanna Lumley, the show’s presenter. Ms Lumley visited Derry in  to take part in a conference marking the th anniversary of Children in Crossfire, the charity set up by Mr Moore. She ed last autumn to film for the series in which she visits places special to her. googletag.cmd.push Ms Lumley said: “In Derry we wanted to film the historic murals, The Derry Girls and my friend Richard Moore, the ‘Derry Lama’, as the Dalai Lama calls him. “It suddenly seemed that we could link these three stories together by art: the ravishing mural Saoirse-Monica showed me of the Derry Girls led us easily to Karl, whose team is creating such important new art work in this fabulous city. “Would it be possible to celebrate the le-affirming achievements of the man the Dalai Lama calls ‘My hero’ in a mural  “The finished work is utterly magnicent, and I am proud that I was allowed to spray a tiny bit of it under Karl’s watchful eye. Part of me will always remain in Derry, a city I love with all my heart.” googletag.cmd.push  Mr Moore said: “When Joanna told me towards the end of our recording that we had one more stop to make, I could not have ever imagined what I was about to be shown. “I am so honoured and humbled at this wonderfully generous gesture. Joanna has been a good friend to me and a great supporter of Children in Crossfire, both of which mean a great deal to me. “She has also built a great rapport with Derry and many of its people, and I look forward to tuning in to Home Sweet Home to see our city at its best.     “I am also grateful to Karl Porter from UV Arts for his vision and genuine passion for this project”. Karl Porter from UV Arts, the creative arts team behind a whole host of public artworks in the city and the artist who painted the mural, said: “Its not everyday you get to paint a mural with Joanna Lumley, who is apparently very afraid of heights and I was told she will not get on the lt, but she did! “ “Joanna helped me direct the cherry picker and also painted one of the most important parts of the mural - the connection, the area where The Dalai Lama and Richard Moore touched. “I think the symbolism of this helps strengthen the relationship and the meaning behind the mural. “The mural depicts a Buddhist blessing, a signicant moment between His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Richard Moore. “The Unalome symbol rising from that connection is the Buddhist symbol representing the path to enlightenment. “Our journey in le is never perfect, never straight or even in the right direction but a journey nonetheless, full of lessons and experiences. Something that Richard has lived experience of, having overcome such a powerful injury to lead a wholesome and selfless le dedicated to others.” Karl said that when first approached about the project he was delighted to have the chance to celebrate one of Derrys greatest living heroes. “The chance to create our own connections led us to collaborate with Belfast based artist and illustrator Conor McClure and together create this powerful piece of art. “If you look closely, the shape of the heads and the Dalai Lamas embrace - forms the shape of a heart, a simple yet subtle way to celebrate the connections between these two iniduals. “It was a great privilege for me to be asked to produce this new mural. The image we have used is iconic, showing the Dalai Lama’s deep spirituality as well as his admiration for Richard Moore. I hope it will attract locals and visitors alike for many years to come and a poignant new addition to our street art movement in the city.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Caoimhe Murtagh, a pupil at St Brigids PS, Mayogall, is once again putting Mayogall on the map by appearing as an extra in the drama, which was filmed in Northern Ireland. This is not Caoimhes first TV appearance. The -year-old, who is signed up to the Extras NI agency, has appeared in Mrs Wilson and Mothers Day, alongside Vicky McLure of This is England and Line of Duty fame. Caoimhes mum Colleen says she initially signed her up to build confidence and gain experience.  Caoimhe has that wee something in her, she told Derry Now. googletag.cmd.push She likes the modelling and the dancing and shed like to do a bit of acting in the future.The very first time she went into nursery I remember her singing the Frozen songs, so shes not shy. She had two parts in Marcella. One was in the background where you could vaguely see her and the other one is about four seconds of just her in the shot. She is dancing up and down excited to see herself and tell family and friends and has loved every minute of it. Colleen believes Caoimhes distinctive red hair has been an advantage and has helped her stand out when she has been chosen for parts. googletag.cmd.push Shes easily spotted because of the red hair, shes very distinctive, she said. The red hair was maybe historically a bully tactic, but everybody loves her hair because she is so proud of it. Episode , Series  of Marcella will air tonight on ITV at .pm, butyou cant wait until then, you can follow the lead of Caoimhe and her mum and binge the whole thing beforehand. Weve already seen it on ITV Hub – we couldnt wait to watch it! added Colleen.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Caoimhe Murtagh, a pupil at St Brigids PS, Mayogall, is once again putting Mayogall on the map by appearing as an extra in the drama, which was filmed in Northern Ireland. This is not Caoimhes first TV appearance. The -year-old, who is signed up to the Extras NI agency, has appeared in Mrs Wilson and Mothers Day, alongside Vicky McLure of This is England and Line of Duty fame. Caoimhes mum Colleen says she initially signed her up to build confidence and gain experience.  Caoimhe has that wee something in her, she told Derry Now. googletag.cmd.push She likes the modelling and the dancing and shed like to do a bit of acting in the future.The very first time she went into nursery I remember her singing the Frozen songs, so shes not shy. She had two parts in Marcella. One was in the background where you could vaguely see her and the other one is about four seconds of just her in the shot. She is dancing up and down excited to see herself and tell family and friends and has loved every minute of it. Colleen believes Caoimhes distinctive red hair has been an advantage and has helped her stand out when she has been chosen for parts. googletag.cmd.push Shes easily spotted because of the red hair, shes very distinctive, she said. The red hair was maybe historically a bully tactic, but everybody loves her hair because she is so proud of it. Episode , Series  of Marcella will air tonight on ITV at .pm, butyou cant wait until then, you can follow the lead of Caoimhe and her mum and binge the whole thing beforehand. Weve already seen it on ITV Hub – we couldnt wait to watch it! added Colleen.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallonsaid:“I have made it clear that I take azero tolerance approach to irresponsible behaviour on the roads. Despite the risks of using a mobile phone whilst driving, too many people continue to flout the law on a daily basis. “This new legislation is a strong signal to those willing to take risks on the road that this behaviour will not be tolerated.

We need to call time on this offence and I hope that the loss of a licence will be a price no driver will be willing to pay.” PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Jonathan Roberts said: “We welcome this new legislation which underlines our very straightforward road safety message.     When you are driving, your focus should be on the road and what other road users are doing, free from any distraction. “Our figures clearly indicate that driver distraction, together with inappropriate speed, drink and drug driving are consistently the main causes of the most serious crashes which kill and injure people on roads across Northern Ireland. No phone call No message No social media update is more important than the potentially catastrophic consequence of not paying full attention when driving a vehicle.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallonsaid:“I have made it clear that I take azero tolerance approach to irresponsible behaviour on the roads. Despite the risks of using a mobile phone whilst driving, too many people continue to flout the law on a daily basis. “This new legislation is a strong signal to those willing to take risks on the road that this behaviour will not be tolerated. From today, the penalties for using a hand-held mobile phone while driving will be increased to six points and a pound fine, bringing these in line with Scotland, Wales and England. googletag.cmd.push If you are caught for a second timethere will be no more chances – you will face a court hearing, disqualication and fines of up to pound,. Newly-qualied drivers, who have a ceiling of six points for the first two years after passing the test will face an immediate ban. “But the consequences of using a mobile phone while driving go far beyond the loss of a licence. Distraction while driving is one of the main causes of road traffic collisions on our roads. Many of those collisions causing serious injury and some resulting in loss of le. googletag.cmd.push “My message today couldn’t be clearer –drive responsibly, put your phone down or risk losing your licence. This is not a minor offence and you will not get away with it.” The Minister added:“The changes coming into force tomorrow will I hope go some way to changing drivers’ attitudes and behaviour around the illegal use of mobile phones. We need to call time on this offence and I hope that the loss of a licence will be a price no driver will be willing to pay.” PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Jonathan Roberts said: “We welcome this new legislation which underlines our very straightforward road safety message.     When you are driving, your focus should be on the road and what other road users are doing, free from any distraction. “Our figures clearly indicate that driver distraction, together with inappropriate speed, drink and drug driving are consistently the main causes of the most serious crashes which kill and injure people on roads across Northern Ireland. No phone call No message No social media update is more important than the potentially catastrophic consequence of not paying full attention when driving a vehicle.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The highly-rated young striker joins Ronan Boyce in becoming a permanent member of the first-team squad ahead of the  season, which is now just a matter of weeks away. Derry City fans will remember Ferry from last season, during which the -year-old made his Candystripes debut. Ferry made two substitute appearances last season, his debut coming in a - home defeat to Sligo Rovers on July , and as a late substitute in the defeat to Tallaght in the penultimate league game of the season in November. He played  minutes in total with the first team. googletag.cmd.push The teenager is delighted to have signed his first deal with the club. “I’m over the moon to sign my first deal. I can’t thank the Academy enough for what they’ve done for me to get me to where I am now, as well as Declan, Paddy and all the boys in the first team,” he said. The belief is there from the manager and I can feel it every time I went into training with the first team last year. That’s all you want really, you want belief and faith in you to do well and hopefully I can repay them this year. googletag.cmd.push “As a footballer, most importantly, you have to have belief in yourself. I think I had a lot already before I signed the deal, but now that I have signed the deal, hopefully it gives me more confidence to try and push on this year.”  ‘Fully deserved’ Declan Devine described the contract as ‘fully deserved’ and paid tribute to the club’s Academy coaches who have helped the teenager develop in the striking role. “Our Academy continues to do a magnicent job and this is a compliment to them and also to Patrick who has put his head down and worked so hard.”     “We spoke with him and his parents last week and they are fantastic people.” “I’m looking for Patrick to take this opportunity to kick on now the way Jack Malone, Nathan Gartside and Ronan Boyce are doing.” “He can play anywhere across the front three and he has a very bright futurehe continues to work hard.” “Our supporters will see that we’re working to put down a solid base for the future of the club.” “These young players are the leblood of Derry City and I’m looking forward to working with them and watching them progress at the club.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I suppose with the first lockdown, things were definitely easier. It was spring, coming into summer, we all had the good weather and there was a novelty to it really. Now though, it has been slightly tougher. But listen, overall I canrsquot complain at all. Irsquom still in training, working in football too, so I am very lucky I have that.CB: How did you find things at the start of lockdown because there did appear to be some ambiguity as to whether the Irish League players could be classed as elite athletes and continue playing  That must have been confusing and unsettling AW: It was a strange one no doubt. Certainly everyone involved in the Irish League, especially at Premiership level, strives to be elite. A lot of us are full-time. I have certainly no problem with the extra training that comes with that and the extra work.But the players do need to be subject to regular testing for Covid-. It is counter-productive to what we, as a society, are trying to do in terms of curtailing this disease otherwise.There has been a lot of ambiguity, but certainly I havenrsquot encountered a player who didnrsquot want to be playing. But obviously we are all concerned that we are able to do so in as safe a manner as possible.At the end of the day, after a match or a training session, we are all going back to loved ones and people who may be vulnerable too. We want to ensure they are as protected as possible.CB: In terms of your role and your standing now at Linfield, you would be considered to be one of the veterans of the side, but you still seem as hungry as ever for goals and success.AW: Absolutely, and in many ways you know that has been the case even more since the first lockdown. At that stage I had so much on with my work with the Irish FA, I probably didnrsquot have the time I would have liked to have dedicated to my own football.But certainly you can see the dference it makes to your season and your ability to hit the ground runningyou do get that good pre-season base in.I was doing my own fitness work in the house during the lockdown.I embrace where I am at now in my career and my age. But I am fortunate in that sense. I know a lot of people who get to my stage and they basically dread retirement. I am  now, so I suppose you do think about when retirement will come.Over the past while, as one of the more senior players at Linfield, I have been able to take on more, I suppose, of that advisory role to younger players. You know those younger guys coming to me asking me about fitness programmes, looking for advice about clubs and things like that, it is great.I am still, believe it or not, learning about the game. I am adapting my role on the pitch too as I move into this latter phase of my playing career. Sometimes you have to do that.But I am going back to foundations and in many ways that has really helped my form this season.Things like learning about playing more with your back to goal, how to use that to your advantage. It is something I have really enjoyed and as I say, embraced.CB: You have played under many of the top managers in the Irish League during your time. David Healy, another local figure at the club like yourself, obviously went into the Linfield job very much managerially as a rookie, although having of course achieved so much as a player. How would you rate him as a manager and indeed how he has made that switch from the pitch to the dugout AW: David I know, never really foresaw becoming a manager. He would tell you that himself. What I do notice about him is, despite everything he achieved, he never talks about his playing days. He is a huge Linfield supporter and he is results-driven. Make no mistake though, he rules with an iron fist.He expects very high standards. It is the job of the players who are there to win. Thatrsquos it, no excuses. Dferent managers bring dferent attributes to any job. But certainly with David,you fall below his standard, you will know.With playing under the like of David Jeffrey, he is a very dferent case. He loved to create that whole ethos of lsquoeverbody hates Linfieldrsquo, and I guess tap into that siege mentality side of things.DJ I suppose, would have been a bit more touchy-feely with the players than perhaps David Healy. Jeffrey would have brought the players to the side, and had the little one-to-one man management conversations with them.But I will say working with David [Healy], especially as he himself was a striker, has taken my game to a whole dferent level since I have been working with him. There is never a comfort zone at Linfield mdash that is the big thing. That has been a key part of my longevity I believe. You constantly have to be kicking on at Linfield. Anyone who coasts at Linfield, they donrsquot last long.CB: Casting your mind back to your days with Kilmore Rec, how much do you think the Amateur League and Kilmore helped you in terms of being ready for the steps up you made AW: Thatrsquos a really good question. The Amateur League is a brilliant springboard for then moving on to the Irish League. You play real first team football. As a player, you can sometimes spend too long at bigger clubsrsquo academies.I had been at the Glentoran academy for a while before I went back to Kilmore for first team football. I was lucky at that time with the Kilmore first team that was there. I played with boys like Gary Curran, Paul Smyth, Joe McMahon.They were players who wanted to win so badly, they played fair, but they played hard. I went into Duck [Donal] Bellrsquos team just as the club were going on a great Irish Cup run that season. That gave me a complete love for the game.But I quickly got to the stage where I didnrsquot just want to do two days a week with my football. Donrsquot get me wrong, the Amateur League, Premier Section is a good standard. As a footballing family, there is a lot for us to be proud of with the Amateur League.Obviously at the moment, all the clubs at that standard are in such a dficult place, but a good club at that level serves a purpose in so many ways, especially for the community. For clubs like Kilmore, and indeed all those playing at that level, it is a real tragedy that there is no football being played at the moment.CB: You are also heavily involved in the coaching side of things with your work with the IFA. Is coaching something you think you might be interested in post-playing, and indeed do you want to remain in football when you hang the boots up AW: I am definitely at the stage now I suppose where I am asking myself how can I remain in the game. It is without doubt something I want to do, to stay in football. But it is about working out exactly in what role that would be best for me.I suppose I have been able to work on a bit of a niche thing for myself with the Irish FA with a coaching and education role. I have done a bit of work with Gerard Lyttle with the Northern Ireland under-age teams and that has been something I have really enjoyed. It is great to see the progress of the younger boys through the dferent age levels with Northern Ireland.CB: You made the move for a time to Hamilton and were up against the top teams in Scotland. How was playing over there for you AW: It is funny you ask about that. My uncle only last night was asking me about all that is happening with Celtic at the moment. When I was there in Scotland you had boys like James McCarthy, Leigh Grfiths, James Forrest all up-and-coming and you could tell easily at that stage that they were boys who were going places. It is definitely a better standard of football in Scotland than a of people realise. I remember when I moved to Hamilton from Lisburn Distillery, I had played for Distillery on the Tuesday night, and then the move to Hamilton picked up momentum quickly.All of a sudden, come the Sunday of that week, there I was playing for Hamilton at Aberdeen in a Scottish Cup game in front of , people. I have to be honest, maybe I was a bit young at the time, maybe the home sickness got the better of me, but I do regret that I came home from Scotland again so soon.I have regretted it every day. You donrsquot want to let the like of that eat away at you, but I was there. I was rubbing shoulders with the gamersquos best.If I could go back and relive that experience again, I would do it in a heartbeat. But you donrsquot want to dwell on it, otherwise it could destroy you.I trained as hard as anyone over there. Maybe I would say compared to others at that standard, I struggled technically. You can get so down on yourself but when you are younger. For me, the chance came too early.It was the last day of the January transfer window when I made the move to Scotland. It actually looked for a long time that Irsquod be going to Aberdeen. However, that fell through at the last minute. I went to Hamilton then, but unfortunately it was just the wrong club for me.I did have chances again to go across the water. When Warren Feeney got the Newport job, he wanted me to go across there, but it wasnrsquot right for me. Everyone has a dferent journey. I was a late developer.Football is a tough place. People watch the Premier League and think that is what it is all about, but in many ways that is not the real picture of what football is, the glamour that is seemingly there. It is so tough to crack the code across the water.It is especially dficult for an Irish kid. If it is an English kid at an English club or a Scottish youngster at a Scottish club, they can easily go back and forth to their family, and alleviate that home-sickness.You canrsquot have thatyou are an Irish kid over there as easily. It can be lonely at times, and it is tough there is no doubt.CB: When you look at Scottish football this season, and particularly in the Premiership for Celtic and Rangers, there has been a complete transformation in fortunes and that in the season when Celtic have been chasing that historic ten-in-a-row. Has the role-reversal between the two Glasgow sides surprised you AW: There is no doubt, the change has been really drastic. I never imagined, despite how much Steven Gerrard has improved Rangers that the gap would be this big, particularly this early in the season.I know Michael Beale, a coach at Rangers from working at the IFA. He is a methodical coach, leaves nothing to chance, and I have no doubt he will have had a big role on the success Rangers are enjoying on the pitch at the moment. Gerrard has done a great job of getting that Rangers back four shored up.But things go wrong. For Celtic, I have no doubt they have found it dficult playing without fans.They definitely feed off the atmosphere that is usually generated by the supporters at Celtic Park.And the Dubai trip has been a really unwanted distraction that has not helped them at all.I do believe however for Celtic it can be a quick turn-around. I donrsquot necessarily see that they will now have to wait years for another Scottish title, the way in which it has been so long since Rangers last won it.Celtic can dust themselves down. Football can be so fluid. That is one of the great things about it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch named Irish club of the year by writers  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH RFC have been voted as the best rugby club in Ireland.The club was named Club of the Year by the Guinness Rugby Writers of Ireland Club of the Year.The club won the accolade for its outstanding community outreach work during the Covid- lockdown.This community spirit, said the Rugby writers, was nurtured from mini rugby players through to the seniors.Club chairman James Kirk said everyone at the club was delighted with the award.We are obviously very pleased. We have known about getting the award for a while before it was actually made public knowledge, so it has been in the pipeline, he remarked.ldquoWe are very proud that what it represents especially is our work with community engagement. That is something we pride ourselves on here at Ballynahinch.ldquoIt is really special to have been awarded the prize this year especially. It has been such a tough year, for everyone, and for all sports clubs. It is certainly a nice little boost that we have been able to get this.James said the club was concentrating on getting the green light for action on the pitch to .ldquoThat is what everyone wants and what everyone is missing. To not be able to get playing is dficult, but of course we absolutely recognise why it is the case. Public health is of paramount importance.Ballynahinch RFC usually fields seven adult teams, as well as youth teams, a ladiesrsquo team and a thriving mini rugby section.ldquoThere has been no action at the club since October. New showers, installed at a cost of pound,, have not been used, James explained.He said that before the current lockdown members were able to use their free time to make improvements around the club.ldquoWe obviously donrsquot have that at the moment, due to the current restrictions, he continued.ldquoIt was great to see how the people benefited from it. They certainly did seem to have their spirits lted. Our volunteers are a hugely important part of the club, and that has had to be stopped too.ldquoHopefully things do improve soon, but I guess we are like everyone and just have to wait and see how things develop with coronavirus.Sinead Kissane, chairperson of the Rugby Writers of Ireland, said: ldquo was a very challenging year for all, but it is also important to recognise the work and achievements of many during this dficult time..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-BidBirdwatch.jpg","title":"Bid for help in the Big Garden Birdwatch event this weekend  ","story":"PEOPLE across the district are being encouraged to take part in the RSPBrsquos annual Big Garden Birdwatch, which takes place this weekend.The UK-wide event is the worldrsquos largest garden wildle survey with locals asked to help from this Friday to Sunday.For many people, garden birds provide an important connection to nature and bring joy and comfort, as well as being vital for mental health and wellbeing, with the RSPB hoping for a big response to the weekend survey.RSPB NI, a charity that works to inspire everyone to give nature a home and to secure a healthy environment for wildle, is hoping that more people than ever will celebrate their love of nature and unite to count garden birds at the end of January for the annual Big Garden Birdwatch.The charity said that over the past year, itrsquos been clear to see how important the natural world is to everyonersquos mental health and wellbeing.In addition, the RSPB says there has been a surge in interest in the nature on peoplersquos doorsteps, with many coming to rely on garden birds to bring joy and comfort in these unsettling times.People keen on taking part in the birdwatch are being asked to spend just one hour watching and recording the birds in their garden before sending their results to the RSPB.Close to half a million people join in the Birdwatch every year across the UK, with just under , of them from Northern Ireland.Anne-Marie McDevitt, the RSPB NIrsquos head of species, said with more people having to stay at home over the past year, everyone has been spending more time outdoors and in gardens and, as a result, have been noticing nature more and having more time to engage with it.ldquoLast year, people were asking usmore birds were singing during the lockdown, but itrsquos not that there has been more wildle about itrsquos just that wersquove had more time and space to notice it, she explained.ldquoBy taking part in the Big Garden Birdwatch, you are helping to build an annual snapshot of how our birdle is doing. It is only by us understanding how our wildle is faring that we can protect it.ldquoWersquove noticed that more people have signed up now for the Birdwatch than had at this stage last year, which is fantastic. We know that nature is in crisis and together we can all take action to solve the problems facing it. Nature needs us.Just one hour every year for the past four decades has made the RSPBrsquos big garden birdwatch the worldrsquos largest garden wildle citizen science project. Now in its nd year,  million birds have been counted.Last yearrsquos results showed that house sparrows remained at the top of the big garden birdwatch rankings in Northern Ireland, with an average of almost five sparrows being spotted in gardens.Collared doves flew into the top , replacing coal tits, while sightings of goldfinches and robins were up too.While counties Down and Tyrone both had the same top two in  mdash house sparrows followed by starlings mdashstarlings were the most-spotted birds in Antrim, Armagh and Derry-Londonderry, ahead of house sparrows, while Fermanaghrsquos number one bird was the chaffinch.The Big Garden Birdwatch continues to highlight the winners and losers in the garden bird world and while house sparrows and starlings may be the UKrsquos most commonly sighted birds, a closer look at the data shows that numbers have ped dramatically since the birdwatch began in .House sparrows are down %, while starlings are down %.Itrsquos also a pattern echoed by two more garden favourites, with blackbirds and robins down % and % respectively.To sign up for the for the big garden birdwatch visit www.rspb.org.uk birdwatch while to learn more about RSPB NIrsquos work log on at www.rspb.org.uk nireland  .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Brexit.jpg","title":"Brexit trading with Great Britain ‘complete nightmare’%2C says owner  ","story":"THE impact of Brexit and the Irish Sea border is impacting on one of the districtrsquos most popular garden centres.Beth Lunney mdash who runs the Saintfield Nursery Centre along with her family mdash has described the impact of the most signicant change to trading in decades and one that will affect many businesses.She said changes became apparent in November, just weeks before the UK formally left the EU.As part of the garden centrersquos preparations for the new sea border it, had signed up to the governmentrsquos Trader Support Service, with Beth also liaising with her suppliers in England.Her longstanding supplier of azaleas and rhododendrons got in touch and revealed that he was not going to be able to get the delivery to Saintfield, explaining that it was because of the possibility that there could be soil in the pots.The UK supplier had correctly interpreted the new rules which apply on trade in plants between Great Britain and Northern Ireland which is still in the EUrsquos plant health system and therefore must apply EU rules on products entering from Great Britain.Plants now need a plant health certicate to enter the country, but some products are completely banned, including soil as it can carry pests and diseases, but there maybe even more problems ahead.Beth said it was being suggested in some quarters that there may be an issue with pallets and even wooden handled forks and spades coming into Northern Ireland due to Brexit and the Irish Sea border and even delays in getting wooden furniture which she currently has on order.In the wake of Bethrsquos UK supplier of azaleas and rhododendrons getting in touch, her rose supplier subsequently got in contact via email to confirm that he would not be able to supply roses which had been on order since the autumn for planned deliveries throughout the season.ldquoThe problem is the peat reduced compost they use along with wood fibre and bark to pot up the roses, Beth explained, expressing sympathy for her suppliers.ldquoThe growers in GB are in a terrible position. They cannot take a chance and send plants to us as they may be delayed at our new border. A plant, like food, is perishable and a delivery could be taken and destroyed. Who will be willing to take that chance  I guess no one.Beth said Northern Ireland has the same climate as the rest of Great Britain and plants that do well there will also do well here, explaining that the local nursery is more selective about taking plants from Europe.She said the new regulations were not just a challenge for Saintfield Nurseries, but the entire Northern Ireland horticultural industry.The new reality for some businesses is that it has become easier to get key supplies from the EU, with Beth explaining that she already gets part of her stock from the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland and that this may have to increase.She said that several nurseries in the Republic of Ireland are emailing the Saintfield business saying theyrsquore going to have roses, but they may not be the particular ieties that they really want.Beth added: ldquoWe were told we would leave the EU as one country, the UK.

I have made up my mind to go abroad to work and I think a lot of other students will do that as well.The Nursing and Midwery Council , the registration body for nurses, recently extended its Emergency Standards to allow final year nursing students to undertake paid clinical placements in order to support the existing nursing workforce during the pandemic.While this has been introduced in England, Scotland and Wales, Robin Swann has declined to implement them into Northern Ireland.In early December, the Department of Health said a joint statement from the NMC and UK chief nursing officers explained that students would not be put into paid placements, as happened earlier during the pandemic.The statement said that instead, employing health trusts would protect their status as supernumerary students and continue to support them through high quality placements, which is a fundamental aspect of pre-registration nurse training.South Down MP Chris Hazzard is supporting the call from Eimear and other final year nursing students.He added: ldquoThese nurses are working at the front line and saving lives.

He has performed the role of club chairman, with his playing reduced to part-time due to the fact he suffers from arthritis in a finger.He has played for Drumaroad in the past, and in more recent seasons for the former top club in Downpatrick, De La Salle.Back in the days of the Lecale Leaguersquos Spin magazine, which was edited by the late and sadly-missed Gerry Carson, Jim provided lsquoPeople in the Newsrsquo and lsquoAt your Servicersquo on a regular basis.This was back in the late s. Starting in  he produced another magazine named Equipment Plus.At this stage, he was running his Table Tennis Servicesfrom his home in Castlewellan. However, as many will recall, for some years he ran Northern Irelandrsquos only table tennis shop in Irish Street, Downpatrick. He had a steady line of customers from near and far who came to make their purchases.As all local players will of course know, Jim is the local man to go to for advice on what rubber suits inidual players.As one who has made use of his help and advice on many occasions, it is quite common to arrive in Strangford to play a match, or indeed in another local hall, and find Jim replacing rubbers.He has also given people from ious local halls advice and has moved many on to pimpled rubbers in recent years, saving them money. A good many seasons back, Jim, anxious to give some of the Strangford clubrsquos younger players a bit of extra publicity, wrote reports for the Down Recorder.As a close associate to the long-time secretary of the Lecale League, Pat Morgan, there was never any doubt who would replace Pat when he sadly passed away.Since taking over, he has certainly done his utmost to keep the league going. He has brought in new clubs and written regular and well-received reports, as well as travelling to matches to take team photos.As well as being a great supporter of the Lecale League over many years, he has also been a great supporter of the East Down Churches League.He has attended and made donations for the leaguersquos annual charity cup match, as well as being present at their annual presentation evening.While Jim has been in regular action in recent seasons, he has proven that while form is temporary, class is permanent.When called upon to help a local team out in the Belfast  District League, he has been the only player on the team to win a game.As well as being a title-winning player, he has also proven he is a superb organiser as those that have attended the Lecale Leaguersquos th and th anniversary evenings know.In fact, so many turned up at the th anniversary event that lsquohouse fullrsquo notices had to go up.He even ran out of anniversary mugs for those who had played in the league over the years.While the Lecale League may not have as many teams as it did had in the past, the fact that it is still going is mainly thanks to Jim.It is also worth noting that with his guidance, the many charity tournaments he runs every season have raised a lot of money for Marie Curie and provided some great action for players.It is thanks to Jim and the late Pat Morgan that the league has been going now for over  years.

Even before the pandemic hit last year, wersquod got to a point where we were considering closing. Then the pandemic happened and we knew that it wasnrsquot the right time. We just had to keep going.ldquoAfter Christmas we knew we all needed to have time for ourselves and our families as we realised that so much of our own lives were being out on hold doing the voluntary work. Mum is also getting older, shersquos  now, and we just felt that we had done as much as we could.She stressed that all counselling sessions promised would continue they were complete.ldquoWe have been family run on a voluntary basis and due to the generosity of the local community, we were able to pay up to three therapists at any given time with no waiting time for those in distress or despair, added Brenda.She said that while the lockdown had presented challenges to the group regarding fund-raising and provision of support, counselling work continued through Zoom.ldquoTherersquos been some great fund-raising and we have been truly grateful but we just felt it was time to step back.Brenda said that while she hope that others may well organise and take over the gap that PIPS Downpatrickrsquos closure may leave, she felt that local mental health provision had moved on since the group started.ldquoWe would hope that the statutory services run by the Trust will continue. There are now mental health social workers in all the surgeries, yet  years ago you wouldnrsquot have heard of this, she added.Brenda said that while her family was sad at the closure, they were all very proud of what they had achieved with the help of the local community.ldquoWe truly believe we have saved lives and while it has been challenging at times, I wouldnrsquot have missed it for the world.

In , the  gained two million new members worldwide per month.The Strava team wrote in the report: ldquoAt the global level, the Covid- pandemic resulted in a rise of activity on Strava like wersquove never seen before, far surpassing our normal projections.In the UK, from March to May, members logged  per cent more outdoor activities than would be expected for that time of year, making the UK the most active global nation for outdoor activity.Alison continued: ldquoIt was a very bad year for everyone last year, and unfortunately this year has started in much the same way. With running though, it is one of those sports that is still accessible to us to take part in.When the regulations on sporting activity took hold, Alison said she and other members of the club were fastidious in following them to the letter.ldquoWe took our directive closely from Sport NI. We were able to develop a training plan that our members could follow inidually in January, and our members, because of the fact they are associated with the club, are particularly stringent about following the protocols as they should be done.ldquoRunning is something that can still be done outside, safely, and at a distance. Unless, for example you are running in a train of people, in these times, it is still a relatively low-risk activity. Both our sport and cycling have been able to proceed relatively well in terms of participation numbers.ldquoAnd from a mental health perspective, it offers so much. It has been a terrible time, for everybody for months with everything that has been happening. People have lost their lives, their loved ones, their livelihoods, running can be a nice outlet to just get away from things for that short time.Things may still be in limbo now in terms of planning any sporting activities locally in the district, but East Down AC members are still keeping their fingers crossed that the year ahead can still be one which will become more positive the longer into it we get.ldquoThis time last year, we would have had all our members training a lot, said Alison. ldquoThis year of course, we are not able to offer that. The Jimmyrsquos K is obviously a big event traditionally in the local athletics calendar, but that can attract around  runners. At the moment, it is just too dicy to even entertain that we could host that.ldquoHowever, we havenrsquot given up hope that we can still have some action to speak of later in the year with events. We would urge our members to keep training, keep themselves ready for when things can come back.ldquoWe know there are people out there who are naturally struggling with how things are. However people are there for you. The amount of virtual contact we all now have is something to embrace in these times. We have found we can even run a virtual league, which is something.Alison is hopeful that normal service can be resumed soon, as for many it is a huge leline to be a member of a running club.ldquoSome people are solitary. They may live alone, or work long hours alone. For those people, coming to the club to train, is as important in terms of getting face-to-face company with others.ldquoThese are the type of runners who donrsquot come to win the medals, they donrsquot come with winning as being the most important thing. It is about that human connection.ldquoDefinitely when I look around the town in Downpatrick, I can see more people out running, especially around the Quoile River and on the streets.ldquoRunning is a great outlet.

That said, the Board and management are focused on achieving the best outcomes for all concerned.ldquoThe Board and management ask the parents of pupils, past pupils and members of the public impacted by these proposals to make their voices heard by participating in the consultation process. This is a matter for the entire community ndash not just those directly involved in education.The statement continued: ldquoFor over  years, St Patrickrsquos [the Red High] has been at the heart of the local community as a centre of learning, a resource hub and as an active contributor to civic le.ldquoPupils, past and present, have made and continue to make signicant contributions in the fields of sport, art, music, business and public service.ldquoThe motivation of the Board of Governors and management of the school is to ensure the widest range of parental and pupil choice remains available in the East Down region.Last December, the chairman of the Board of Governors, Dr Aidan Hamill, lost an application to the High Court for a judicial review questioning the Department of Educationrsquos authority to go ahead with the proposal before securing agreement from its governors.Under the merger plan the new school would educate girls and boys aged - with an admission of  pupils per year, with up to a maximum of % of pupils admitted through academic selection.Grammar schools in Northern Ireland normally admit students exclusively through academic selection.It is intended that existing school campuses would be used ldquopending capital investment for a one site solution.The closure of the three schools will also mean the loss of distinctive local school unorms as well as requiring all teaching and support staff to reapply for jobs at the proposed new school.The controversial amalgamation has been put forward by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schoolson behalf of the De La Salle Congregation, who are the trustees of all three schools.St Maryrsquos High School and De La Salle High School have declined to comment this week.However, both schools previously welcomed the proposed amalgamation, which originally included merging St Columbarsquos College in Portaferry.Mr Ciaran Maguire, principal of De La Salle, said in December that he was ldquodelighted to see the proposal going to full public consultation.He said at the time: ldquoItrsquos been a long time coming. I am reassured now that the families of the greater Downpatrick area will have an opportunity to finally get behind the vision to secure the town as a model of good practice, where childrenrsquos education is a priority.Ms Rosemary McLaughlin, principal of St Maryrsquos, said last September that the merger reflected her values and belief in all-ability schools.She said: ldquoIn terms of social justice, I feel the move is very important.

This is a musical and visual tale of ancient times that is relevant and attractive to modern Ireland.The St Patrick Show will also feature spoken word from  Grammy-nominated Fontaines DC frontman Grian Chatten and other well-known artists.The show will be filmed and be available virtually at first, but has the potential to create a new dinner-theatre culture at the St Patrick Centre and to travel internationally.ldquoWe already have interest from New York and Washington for this exciting project, said Dr Campbell. ldquoWe had planned four shows during St Patrickrsquos Week at the St Patrick Centre, but now due to Covid Restrictions this will be a virtual online event.It is anticipated that rehearsals will begin next month, subject government restrictions, with filming dates in early March.When restrictions lt, dinner theatre audiences in Downpatrick will not only drink in the refreshing story of Patrick this summer, but taste unique recipes created by celebrity chef Terry McCoyrsquos, showcased in his book, Saint Patrickrsquos Plate.Funding has come from from the Arts Council, the Community Foundation for Northern Ireland and Newry Mourne and Down Council.The aim is to have the show in place, marketed and ready for theof the tourism season.The St Patrick Centre is currently in discussion with Tourism Ireland about releasing the virtual event in tourist markets around the world, particularly in the United States.Details can be found on the St Patrick Centrersquos website: www.saintpatrickcentre.Artists are being asked to submit their CVs and tapes via email at stpatrickcentreshow@gmail.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Speeder.jpg","title":"Speeder clocked at 82mph – double road speed limit  ","story":"A DRIVER has been clocked travelling at mph in the mph zone at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick.The figure mdash confirmed by the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership mdash was recorded on an electronic speed indicator device which was one of a number put in place across the district last year.While the provision of the device at the entrance to a sports pitch at the Strangford Road was welcomed, a number of residents believe that the device should be located further back long the main road as the speed of drivers along this particularly busy and built-up area is a major concern.Some Strangford Road residents argue that the problem with the speeding device is that it is in the wrong location, given that it is just a few hundred yards from the start of a mph zone close to the townrsquos war memorial.They say that effectively, the speed restriction sign is policing only small section of the busy main road where there are literally just a handful of homes.Further back along the road, there are several major housing developments, many where young families live. There is also a busy local authority garage and depot and a private care nursing home, with this section of road governed by a mph limit.Residents say that the overwhelming majority of drivers who speed along the road are travelling from the Strangford direction and that the issue could be addressed mdashthe speed indicator sign was relocated further back to the entrance to Lecale Park mdashit has to have any signicant impact on the speeding.Those who live at this part of Downpatrick say while the majority of drivers obey the mph speed limit, there are a number who do not.The new speed indicator devices, designed to make drivers aware of their speed and to slow down, are dotted across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area and have been warmly welcomed.South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Downpatrick councillor John Trainor say the speeding data recorded by the devices and released by the Policing and Community and Safety Partnershipshows an average speed reduction in the Downpatrick area of .% and that the new initiative is working.Mr McGrath said that when he and his SDLP colleague initially floated the idea of erecting the speed indicator signs, the feedback was that the such a scheme would not be efficient and would be too expensive, with little reward.He insists that confirmation that in the Downpatrick area alone speeds have reduced by .% in the short time the devices have been in place vindicates their installation.ldquoWhile John and I are delighted to hear that speeds are reducing across the district, we are in no way complacent about this.ldquoThe fact that the PCSP is doubling the provision of speed indicator signs is not only an indication of their efficacy, but also highlights the continued need for them.However, Mr McGrath said he was concerned about the mph speed recorded at the Strangford Road and appealed to all drivers to ensure they stick to the speed limit.Cllr Trainor said plans were in place to provide an additional seven speed indicator devices across the district.He added: ldquoCombining this with infrastructure minister Nichola Mallonrsquos scheme for mph zones at  schools across the country can only help safety on our roads.ldquoConsidering the very low temperatures we have witnessed this weekend, this is another reminder that we all need to be conscious of our speed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-St.jpg","title":"St Patrick’s parade off  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has pulled the plug on the forthcoming St Patrickrsquos Day parade in Downpatrick.The decision mdash confirmed on Monday mdash comes a week after a number of councillors urged the local authority to formally cancel the cross-community event due to the continuing coronavirus pandemic.Last yearrsquos cross-community spectacular was cancelled ahead of the first national lockdown to help combat the deadly virus and with infection rates remaining high across the district, the council has finally decided to cancel the event in the grip of the continuing public health emergency.The local authority, which last week would only confirm that it was ldquoreviewing plans for its St Patrickrsquos Day events in line with the current restrictions and ongoing response to the Covid pandemic, told councillors on Monday afternoon that the Downpatrick parade and one in Newry had been postponed, with the wider media informed yesterday.In the wake of other councils postponing their respective St Patrickrsquos Day parades, Newry, Mourne and Down was coming under increasing pressure to follow suit.The local parades have now been added to the growing list of national and international events across Northern Ireland which have been cancelled due to the pandemic, including the North West  motorcycle races.Belfast City Council has cancelled its St Patrickrsquos Day parade, with Derry City and Strabane and Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon councils currently discussing how their March  events will be celebrated.Local council officials have confirmed that following careful consideration of the current restrictions and the ongoing response to the Covid- pandemic, they have ldquoregretfully cancelled the traditional St Patrickrsquos Day celebrations.The organisation has confirmed that it will be hosting some activities and performances online via its tourism and arts social media channels.In addition, training green spotlights on a number of major buildings, including Down Cathedral and St Patrickrsquos Church in Downpatrick, is expected to go ahead as planned,restrictions allow.Council chairwoman Laura Devlin said it was with ldquogreat regret that the annual St Patrickrsquos Day parades have been cancelled for the second year in a row.She said the March  events were normally an opportunity to celebrate the districtrsquos connection with St Patrick and the arearsquos important place in his the patron saintrsquos story.ldquoI know how disappointed many will be about this decision and I share their disappointment, said Cllr Devlin. ldquoHowever, the councilrsquos priority at this time is to continue to support the ongoing response to the Covid- pandemic across wider society.She said that the decision to cancel was made in the best interests of residents, visitors, festival participants and event partners.She also confirmed that the local authority will continue to review plans for this yearrsquos tourism events programme on an ongoing basis and in line with guidance from the Northern Ireland Executive.Councillors Willie Clarke, Dermot Curran, Billy Walker and Robert Burgess, who last week appealed to the local council to cancel the parade, welcomed the decision and said they were looking forward to the  event going ahead.They said the local authority had to act to avoid any needless delay, warning that there was no way any festival parade could take place in the current Covid climate.Cllr Clarke said people needed to know that the parade would not happen, highlighting the continuing importance of protecting peoplersquos health.Cllr Curran said the event could not possibly have proceeded, given the ongoing public health emergency.He said the Covid situation remained ldquoextremely serious and that news of the parade cancellation would not come as a surprise.Cllr Walker urged council officials not to wait until the ldquoeleventh hour to pull the plug on the parade and hoped that next yearrsquos event will be one of the best ever.Cllr Burgess said current public health advice was clear, which meant the local council had no option but to cancel the parade, and urged council officials to start preparations for next yearrsquos event..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Views.jpg","title":"Views sought on play park upgrade  ","story":"NEWCASTLE residents are being encouraged to have their say on plans to upgrade the hugely popular Downs Road play park.Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash which is planning to carry out the work mdash wants to hear what local people have to say

the Newcastle Centre to be invested at the Downs Road.ldquoGiven that the local authority is surveying what people would like to see provided, it is essential that they respond.Cllr Clarke hopes people will engage in the consultation process, emphasising the need toensure that all-ability equipment will feature in the upgraded play park to cater for children with special needs.He added:

He is an Irish’ president, so it is worthwhile recalling for President Biden just what America’s Irish heritage isConsequently it is worthwhile recalling for President Biden just what America’s Irish heritage is. If America has an Irish heritage it is fundamentally that of Ulster-Scotswho, like their fellows from England and Wales, established the American colonies to be free from Episcopalianrule. They sought freedom from the religious intolerance of Anglican and Roman Catholic hierarchies, the liberty to worship in their own way, something that Anglican and Catholic Episcopalian persecution denied them in Europe. It was this ‘dissenting’ tradition that became the basis for modern liberal democracy, something opposed by Rome in particular. And it was these dissenters who fought for American independence, whilst Catholics and Germans fought for the Crown.    \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...\"Dr James Dingley is a Belfast based academic and chair of the Francis Hutcheson InstituteIndeed, in th century Ireland the government twice seriously considered arming Catholics to help put down Ulster Dissenters and their libertarian creed, leading many to flee to America.Further, the Universities of Hard, Yale and Princeton were all dissenter foundations, whose graduates played a major role in the American Revolution, Declaration of Independence and Constitution. All their ideals were heavily inspired by the Ulster dissenter and philosopher Francis Hutcheson, ‘Father of the Scottish Enlightenment’ and teacher of Adam Smith. Hutcheson’s works were core reading at American universities and for America’s founding fathers. It was Hutcheson who taught the right to rebel against unjust government and advocated the separation of church and state. For Hutcheson, religion should become a purely private affair, excluded from the public realm and discourse and advocated in Ireland .These dissenters constituted one of the three legally defined religious groups in th century Ireland and Britain. Protestant only referred to Anglicans, Dissenters were non-Anglican Reformation churches , whilst Roman Catholics constituted their own legal category. The latter two both suffered similar legal, economic and political disabilities . This gave dissenters a fear of episcopacy, since they were mostly tenant farmers under Anglican Protestant landlords and aristocrats, just like Catholics, whose Episcopalian hierarchy had also persecuted dissenters. This, unlike the Catholics, gave them a burning desire for non-hierarchicalself-government, inidual freedom of conscience and religion — the cornerstone of liberal democracy.Consequently, ‘Irish’ American dissenters fought against the British and Irish Catholics for Britain. In the s the burning issue in America was the fear of episcopacy, after Westminster had recognised a Catholic episcopacy in Canadaand George III sought to introduce an Anglican episcopacy into the American colonies. This was the dominating public debate behind the revolution, with Ulster dissenters to the fore in creating a liberal democratic America that Irish Catholics fought against. What America is and made her so successful was the fulfilment of dissenter ideals. If President Biden wishes to recognise America’s true ‘Irish’ roots he should visit Hutcheson’s home town of Saintfield, Co Down.• Dr Dingley is chair of the Francis Hutcheson Society——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Such behaviour without regard to the very rules it had signed up to further undermined the EU’s previous vacuous arguments   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Confirmed the notion that the EU Commission will, without hesitation, act to suit its own interests. Lowered the threshold of how the mechanism can be used, particularly as in our view it is designed to alleviate Northern Ireland consequences defined as “serious economic, societal or environmental dficulties that are liable to persist, or to ersion of trade, the Union or the United Kingdom may unilaterally take appropriate safeguard measures”. Revealed that the Northern Ireland arguments advanced by the EU were not borne out of principle but rather political opportunismThe revealing actions on Friday by the EU have caused very signicant anger and harm within Northern Ireland and has compounded the notion that the EU is playing fast and loose with Northern Ireland, attempting on the one hand to require the UK government to enforce its obligations whilst being prepared to waive elements of the protocol when it suits the needs of the EU. This is unsustainable. It is evident that the EU’s priority is not protecting the Belfast Agreement but is entirely about protecting its own single market.• Morning View: NI Protocol an even bigger disaster than feared so DUP change of tone is welcomeNorthern Ireland is already suffering real economic and societal dficulties as a consequence of the first month of the protocol.The Democratic Unionist Party opposed the protocol in Parliament and when its votes mattered on the floor of the House of Commons prevented the passage of the Withdrawal Agreement, containing the protocol. As unionists we find the imposition of this protocol and its outworkings offensive and running contrary to everything we stand for. No sovereign country should have barriers to trade and customs arrangements placed within it. When others were campaigning for a backstop we strongly warned of the dangers.From the protocol came into force on January   our ministers, MLAs and Members of the Commons and Lords have worked to highlight the problems and barriers imposed by the protocol. Since Friday evening’s EU threats we have been in contact with the UK government from the prime minister, to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove. At a meeting with the NI secretary of state and senior officials from Downing Street on Monday afternoon we made it clear that the UK government has an obligation to defend Northern Ireland’s place within the UK internal market which is being severely undermined by the growing barriers and impediments to trade in the Irish Sea.We have indicated to the government that both the actions of the EU on Friday and the damage being inflicted on our East–West links within the United Kingdom cannot be sustainedNorthern Ireland’s political and economic links to the rest of the United Kingdom are to be maintained and respected in all their parts. The protocol has upset the balance of relationships flowing from the Belfast Agreement that many others claimed were unalterable.The government needs to be bold and be prepared to act to bring about outcomes that underpin Northern Ireland’s full place in the most important internal market for us — that of the United Kingdom. The prime minister must now directly address the people of Northern Ireland on the growing crisis arising from the protocol.For our part, the Democratic Unionist Party has been working to minimise disruption caused by something we opposed while pressing for more radical steps to be taken to negate it completely.In response to the approach adopted by the EU and welcoming the total opposition by all NI unionist representatives in both the Assembly and Westminster to the protocol the DUP will pursue the following:• We will work with other unionists to send a united message to our government, to the European Commission and the Dublin government that Northern Ireland must be freed from the protocol and its problems. • The protocol was passed by the Westminster Parliament and not at Stormont. Our elected representatives in the Northern Ireland Assembly, while careful not to act in a way that would harm the people of Northern Ireland at this time of public health and economic crisis, will actively oppose at every opportunity any negative measures, laws or bills that continue to flow from the protocol and which undermine Northern Ireland’s place in the UK internal market. • We will work in common purpose with all those other MLAs who are prepared to support us. Collectively unionism can make a dference.• Our ministers, Members of the Commons and the Lords will actively work to press the government and hold it to account in support of Northern Ireland’s place in the internal UK market as well as building support to free us from the protocol and its problems.• We are shortly launching an e-petition at Parliament calling on the UK government to use all powers at its disposal to immediately remove any barriers to unfettered trade within the United Kingdom. We are asking all citizens concerned about these issues to show the government the strength of feeling by signing the “Trigger Article  – We want unfettered GB-NI Trade” online e-petition at petition.parliament.uk and further details will follow.• We have indicated to our own government that they now need to act but as the largest unionist party at Stormont we also intend to send a strong signal to the government of the Republic of Ireland that North-South relationships are also impacted by the implementation of a protocol which they supported. Our members cannot and will not continue to act as though relationships are normal.Progress in Northern Ireland was hard won and in recent times it was a well-established principle that in order to respect the delicate community balance within Northern Ireland no governance arrangements could advance unless they had the support of both unionists and nationalists as to do otherwise would result in failure and greater ision.In recent days there has been reported threats on staff and others who carry out their daily duties. All political parties have rightly condemned threats of violence and any unacceptable threats should not be taken into account as part of the equation, by either the UK government or the EU, as a reason not to deal with the protocol and the trade problems flowing from it. It is now the solemn responsibility of all those in leadership but, particularly the UK government, to move quickly to bring about solutions to the signicant societal, environmental and economic dficulties caused by a protocol that is without any unionist support whatsoever.• Morning View: NI Protocol an even bigger disaster than feared so DUP change of tone is welcome——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

However, for the sake of my party, my health and my own conscience, I simply cannot continue in post.ldquoTherefore, I am stepping down as Leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Welsh Parliament with immediate effect.ldquoIt is for the group to decide how best to choose a new leader, but I hope that process will be seamless and speedy, and I pledge my support to whoever becomes leader.Mr Millar - MS for Clwyd West - also issued a statement, referring to \"a dficult week\".ldquoI want to apologise to my family, colleagues and constituents for any embarrassment that some of the media stories may have caused in recent days,\" he said.ldquoThere have been some wildly inaccurate and unfair reports so I want to set out the truth.\"As has been the case in most weeks since September when the Hybrid Senedd was sitting in Cardf Bay, on both the th and th December last year I used the self-serve catering arrangements that were made available for Senedd Members. On both evenings I served myself a pre-ordered, pre-prepared meal that was reheated in the microwave and ate it while drinking an alcoholic beverage and discussing work matters with colleagues.ldquoSocial distancing was maintained throughout these working dinners and it simply did not occur to either me, my colleagues or the catering team that the arrangements may have been inappropriate.ldquoThere was a member of catering staff present in the tea room for a short time after my arrival on the th December but she did not serve me a drink, nor did I request one. In fact, I encouraged the member of staff to go home and close up the counter as it had been a long day for her. No members of catering staff were present on the th December and the counter was closed for the whole evening.ldquoWhile I am advised that I did not breach coronavirus regulations I am very sorry for my actions, especially given the impact of the tough restrictions that people and businesses are enduring.ldquoFor this reason, and given that Paul Davies has resigned as Welsh Conservative Group Leader in the Senedd, I have decided to step down from my front bench role in the Welsh Parliament.ldquoI am cooperating fully with ongoing investigations and will continue to do so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

We have to do the right thing, which may mean that our measures have to be extended for some time to come, but no one should expect a signicant change in the arrangements or a signicant easing of those arrangements at the end of this week.The health minister was also asked about reports the lockdown restrictions may be eased in England, and whether a four-nation approach to easing the lockdown would be preferred.ldquoIts helpful for us to discuss these matters sensibly with each other, he said. ldquoThere is now much more regular engagement between the four governments, thatrsquos with the first ministers are meeting together with Michael Gove for the UK Government.ldquoWe havent had that direct engagement between the first ministers of not just Wales but also Scotland, Northern Ireland and Boris Johnson as prime minister, I think that would help us to do so.ldquoI hope that as it becomes a more real possibility will be able to have a grown up and constructive conversation between all four governments in the UK. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

That has led to unproven allegations that it may have a link to the original outbreak of Covid- in Wuhan in late .China has strongly denied that possibility and has promoted theories that the virus may have originated where or even been brought into the country from overseas with imports of frozen seafood tainted with the virus, a notion roundly rejected by international scientists and agencies.The institutersquos deputy director is Shi Zhengli, a virologist who worked with Peter Daszak, a zoologist on the WHO team mission, to track down the origins of SARS that originated in China and led to the  outbreak.She has published widely in academic journals and worked to debunk theories espoused by the former Trump administration and other American officials that the virus is either a bioweapon or a ldquolab leak from the institute.Following two weeks in quarantine, the WHO team that includes experts from  nations has visited hospitals, research institutes and a traditional wet market linked to many of the first cases. Their visit followed months of negotiations as China seeks to retain tight control over information about the outbreak and the investigation into its origins, possibly to avoid blame for alleged missteps in its early response.Confirmation of the origins of the virus is likely to take years. Pinning down an outbreakrsquos animal reservoir typically requires exhaustive research including taking animal samples, genetic analysis and epidemiological studies. One possibility is that a wildle poacher might have passed the virus to traders who carried it to Wuhan.The first clusters of Covid- were detected in Wuhan in late , prompting the government to put the city of  million under a strict -day lockdown.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityWas it in Myanmar, as the country is officially called  Or was it in Burma, the name Washington and some other foreign administrations continue to use The answer is complicated and, as with many things in the country, politically charged.For generations, the country was called Burma, after the dominant Burman ethnic group. But in , one year after the ruling junta brutally suppressed a pro-democracy uprising, military leaders suddenly changed its name to Myanmar.By then, Burma was an international pariah, desperate for any way to improve its image. Hoping for a sliver of international legitimacy, it said it was discarding a name handed down from its colonial past and to foster ethnic unity. The old name, officials said, excluded the countryrsquos many ethnic minorities. vw,vw,px, px\"Aung San Suu Kyi seen visiting a hospital last week At home, though, it changed nothing. In the Burmese language, ldquoMyanmar is simply the more formal version of ldquoBurma. The countryrsquos name was changed only in English.It was linguistic sleight-of-hand, but few people were fooled. Much of the world showed defiance of the junta by refusing to use the new name.A little over a decade ago, the country began a stumbling semi-democratic transition. The military retained extensive political power, but opposition leaders were freed from prison and house arrest, and elections were allowed. Longtime pro-democracy activist Ms Suu Kyi became the countryrsquos civilian leader.Over the years, many countries and news outlets had begun using the countryrsquos official name. As repression eased and international opposition to the military became less vocal, Myanmar became increasingly common. Inside the country, opposition leaders made clear it didnrsquot matter much anymore. vw,vw,px, px\"US President Joe Biden has pointedly continued to call the country Burma this week Unlike most of the world, the US government still officially uses ldquoBurma, but even Washington has mellowed its stance.In , during a visit to the country, then-President Barack Obama used both Burma and Myanmar. An adviser to Myanmarrsquos president called that ldquovery positive and said it was an ldquoacknowledgement of Myanmarrsquos government.Washingtonrsquos response to the coup seemed designed to highlight old criticisms, with both Secretary of State Antony Blinken and President Joe Biden pointedly avoiding the countryrsquos legal name.ldquoThe United States removed sanctions on Burma over the past decade based on progress toward democracy, Mr Biden said in a statement. ldquoThe reversal of that progress will necessitate an immediate review of our sanction laws.Most other countries, though, continued to call it Myanmar..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Politics behind switch of Burma to Myanmar article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

For their wee legs to run four and five miles non stop, that’s a great achievement.”Presley, who is in Year  at Tandragee Primary School and Frankie, who is in Year  at Bocombra Primary School have become firm friends since joining Soccer Indoors.Although it has been tough during the three Lockdowns over the past year, the pair have been keen to keep themselves fit.Gavin explained that when they spotted the challenge of running a marathon in a month and raise money for Prostate Cancer, the boys were on board from the start.Gavin said: “They were training four or five times a week.“I was diagnosed with diabetes and their enthusiasm certainly motivated me to get out and run as well.” He said Frankie’s mum Carol also took part as she runs regularly.Gavin said they would also run with Presley’s mum Claire Cardwell: “It was a really family affair and it has certainly kept us fit,” said Gavin, who was very pleased with the charity choice as cancer has also affected his own family.

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

The earlier statement from Markethill also includes a reference to DUP minister Edwin Poots which is not included in the Portadown District’s statement on social media.\"Portadown District colour party with Drumcree church in the background. Picture: Freddie Parkinson Press EyeIt states: “The [Markethill] district further call on our fellow brother Orangeman, Edwin Poots, the Minister for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to immediately stop officials within his department from implementing the Irish Sea border checks.”In its response, Portadown District said: “The NI Protocol is an act of betrayal of the unionist community and our position as a sovereign part of the United Kingdom.“Portadown District is well aware of those elected politicians who voted for the Irish Sea Border, now is the time for you to apologise for your past actions and to pledge to do all that you can to bring it down, eventhat means disobeying your political leaders.”The statement goes on to call for “all unionist parties to take all necessary action to veto the implementation of EU laws through the Stormont Assembly”.\"DUP MLA William IrwinThe Markethill District comprises  lodges with a combined membership of more than .William Irwin posted his own response to the Markethill statement, describing the claim he supported the Irish Sea border as “untrue”. He said: “As an Orangeman of some  years, in the district of Loughgall... I am very disappointed by Markethill District Orange No ’s untrue claim. “I am absolutely at one with the many thousands of unionists across Northern Ireland who find the imposition of this protocol and its outworkings offensive and running contrary to everything we stand for,” he said.“I did not vote for the protocol nor have I supported it. To suggest otherwise is wrong, disingenuous and it would appear politically motivated.”Although the overwhelming majority of comments were supportive of the Markethill position, one reply said: “I was stunned to read the alleged Markethill District statement, andit is authenticated, they have seriously breached protocol for one and the duty of an Orangeman. I sincerely hope a retraction is publicly published andnot Grand Lodge need to step in.”In response to the latest Portadown District statement, one member said: “As much as I welcome this as an Orangeman, and it’s great to see, the only problem is it won’t make a dference until Grand Lodge publicly make the same statement to which I cant see them doing. I hope I’m proved wrong.”The Grand Lodge of Ireland has not yet responded to a request for comment.READ: Orange Order heartland rocked by bitter row over Irish Sea borderREAD: Lodge breaks ranks with Orange Order over New Decade New Approach dealA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Business support was a key topic, and it was devastating to hear Tina McKenzie, Chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, discuss the hardships being faced and demonstrating the very bleak outlook for many businesseswe do not find a way forward both in terms of the handling of the pandemic,but also enhancing the support available to these businesses. The impact on business is substantial and that on each of their employees is devastating. Furlough has been a hottopic during this lockdown and as we have seen business vilied for not looking atrestructures, she reminded us of the fact that whilst the support available is welcomed, itremains far from enough to enable survival. I recently received an email from a local politician who stated, “I’m in awe you are still in business”. While this could be accepted as a compliment, this is far from the support andvoice a small business like mine requires or is looking for, and this was conveyed to them. The business community needs a clear voice with a key message and desire, rather than noise. These voices, like Tina, work tirelessly to press the government to step in with moresupport, minimising their costs and contribution while revenues are non-existent, and Iapplaud them for doing so. With news breaking this week that there is still pound million remaining in the Stormont COVID “pot” to be allocated towards businesses before March, I would urge Diane Doddsand Conor Murphy to listen to businesses and their representatives to ensure businessessurvive. It would be truly shamefulthis money had to be ed to Westminster as a result of poor planning and slow reactions, while local businesses are making very dficultdecisions due to lack of financial support which clearly is available, but not utilised. With financial survival for businesses and more importantly each of us as iniduals and our families the sole aim, Tina succinctly reminded us that our elected representatives should beheld to account, not the businesses themselves. The Sunday Times recently reported that the public feels more frightened now than at any time before with % of voters feeling ‘personally threatened’ by COVID. It also reportedthat Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have agreed on a ‘recovery plan’ to save jobs. The realityis however, thatthey and our own Executive do not deliver this strategy correctly, without delay or U-turn, the job market will constrict further. Many professional trade bodies arereporting that their members don’t have enough in the bank until April and judging bynumerous reports this past week, lockdown and on-going restrictions are likely to extend beyond April. How can businesses be expected to survive without this  We all have a voice, but not all of us use it. As a business community we need vocal and active business leaders to speak out to help fight our case. A great demonstrative exampleof this is the great work of my good friend Brian Donaldson from Excluded NI. Throughout,Brian has spoken out and acted to help thousands who have been financially excluded with no support being provided to them. Brian had established himself as newly self-employedchef just before lockdown, only to find that as support packages were announced, he quickly found himself excluded from all government support offered. With a family, and amortgage to pay, Brian created a  for his case to constructively find a resolution forall those who found themselves in the same situation. By working closely with local politicians, Brian, has researched and submitted proposals to the Department for the Economy with numerous resolutions and proposals to deliver financialassistance to these groups, which has resulted in thousands, including Ltd Company directors,eventually being awarded some financial support. Brian continues daily to ensure the excluded have a voice and shows how being a voice can bring about change! As a business owner, I send a huge thank you to all the hard-working professional trade bodies and voices for our communities, who throughout this time have worked tirelessly toensure we all have all have a business toto in the future. If you, like so many, are in adficult situation, be sure to reach out to your local business trade body today to highlight your plight and use their voices as much as you can. We all need as much support andsurvival mechanism as possible. It’s evident that the more voices there are and the louderthey become successful outcomes can be delivered. I will wrap up by leaving you with a well-known quote by Napoleon Bonaparte: ‘Ten people who speak make more noise than ten thousand who are silent’. Until next week, stay safe!
