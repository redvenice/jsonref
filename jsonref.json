Meghan unveils a twist on her go-to style as she arrives in Ireland with a side bun and centre partingBy SIOFRA BRENNAN FOR MAILONLINE She\u0027s recently abandoned her beloved messy bun in favour of a more sleek and formal updo, and today the Duchess of Sussex debuted a new twist on the look.Stepping off the place in Dublin for her first official overseas visit with Harry, Meghan showed off a neat side bun with a side parting.It was a departure from the more severe style she\u0027s worn on several occasions, with hair swept to the back of her head with her hair parted down the middle.  The Duchess wore her hair in a neat updo with a side parting, lending a less severe look to the formal style. She wore her hair in swept back bun with a centre parting to a reception at Marlborough House in London last week Celebrity hairdresser James Johnson told Femail: \u0027The changing of a parting can alter your whole style, instantly.\u0027By keeping the side bun low and opposite, she\u0027s kept the symmetry in her look. This helps keep the over-style elegant, yet with a slight twist, making the hair a focal point.\u0027By keeping the hair balanced Meghans created a formal, more structured style, ideal for any royal appearance.\u0027Switching up the parting can create more dimension for any look, perfect for a plain outfit like Meghan has on here, giving the whole look more personality.   She ditched the messy bun she used to favour, seen here on a visit to Northern Ireland in March (left).

a replica of the pictures from their engagement shoot           The Duchess of Sussex giggled as her husband had his beard stroked by a youngster in Croke Park stadium  Meghan met three-year-old Walter Cullen, who playfully tugged at her hair while she was turned the other way          Nonplussed by  her status, three-year-old Walter giggled after he pulled at the Duchess of Sussex\u0027s hair          Little Walter Cullen tried to hide behind his hands as he was gently told not to pull Meghan\u0027s hair           Later in the day, Harry and Meghan paid a visit to Dogpatch Labs, which is one of Europe\u0027s leading startup hubs           During the visit, the royal couple were treated to a \u0027tech display\u0027 by children taking part in an initiative called CodaDojo           Meghan looked animated as she and Harry spoke to children during their tour of the DogPatch Labs in Dublin today           The pair looked fascinated as the young people involved explained the work they do as part of the programme           Harry and Meghan looked relaxed as they conducted a busy day of engagements, including a tour of the DogPatch Labs          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex took part in a round table discussion during the visit to the leading start-up hub          Harry and Meghan were greeted by crowds of well-wishers as they conducted their second day of engagements today           Harry happily let a cheeky youngster play with his beard during his walkabout of the Croke Park stadium            Prince Harry was gifted a Hurley and Sliotar by one adorable youngster at Croke Park stadium    The Duke and Duchess headed onto the pitch where they watched traditional Gaelic sports being played          Harry opted for a slightly more dressed-down look at the stadium, wearing a light grey blazer, simple white shirt and blue desert boots          Prince Harry was animated as he chatted with two young players at the stadium, who giggled away at his antics          Harry and Meghan were relaxed as they chatted with players taking part in a Gaelic games demonstration          The couple had the opportunity to talk to players, many of whom are involved with community outreach projects that encourage the use of sports for social goodThe couple walked around the frighteningly realistic bronze statues with their sculptor, Rowan Gillespie, and Mike Murphy, editor of The Famine Atlas, who talked them through some of the stark realities of the tragedy for the people of his country.Mr Murphy said afterwards that the couple clearly had some understanding of the famine and what it meant to the people of Ireland but had been genuinely shocked at what they learnt.\u0027In fairness they definitely had a background understanding but were shocked to hear the nitty gritty,\u0027 he said.\u0027Harry mentioned several times at how appalling it was that we don\u0027t seem to have learnt the lessons of the past and we are still seeing famine and food shortages around the world today. \u0027 Sculptor Mr Gillespie added: \u0027This is a living monument and they were genuinely and powerfully moved by what they saw. They were very conscious that this isn\u0027t just about history, that this thing is still going on around us today and it\u0027s relevant to what we do today. The couple both managed to make a speedy change of clothes before arriving at Croke Park museum\u0027Every inidual is moved by what they see, which is incredibly rewarding. It is an incredibly important story between Britain and Ireland.\u0027They were profoundly moved to see the memorial and hear the story behind it. It is part of our joint histories.\u0027Meghan was very strong on the link with the city of Toronto where she lived and Harry spent a lot of time. The city only had 18,000 inhabitants but as those ships came across in their droves, Toronto took in 38,000 disease-ridden, starving famine victims. In the stadium museum the couple saw replica jerseys used in the film Michael Collins, which depicted the shooting, as well as the whistle used by the referee that day and a match ticket.They also saw club records featuring Collins, a key figure in the Irish independence movement, from when he was secretary of the Geraldines GAA club in London between 1909 and 1915. It was the IRA operation led by Collins to kill 14 undercover British intelligence agents operating in Dublin - known as the Cairo Gang - that led to the security forces opening fire on the crowd at Croke Park.Out on the pitch they watched as groups of boys and girls played hurling, camogie - the women\u0027s equivalent - Gaelic football and \u0027fun and run\u0027, a rounders-like game designed to be inclusive for people with disabilities. As the couple met Joe Canning, the Galway player who is regarded as one of the modern greats of hurling and is a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for Ireland, Harry told him: \u0027Apparently you\u0027re like a god.\u0027Harry also met a red-headed boy in wheelchair, Nathan Kiely, seven, and told him how impressed he was with his freckles. Jennifer Lawless, 22, an intern from North Carolina, said: \u0027He said, \u0027You have more freckles than I have. Lovely freckles!\u0027Although the couple were both given hurleys - the curved stick used to hit the ball, or sliotar, in hurling - the duke passed up on the opportunity of having a go himself.It is, however, very difficult: even Joe Canning missed his first shot at goal when he was showing the couple how it was done by the experts. \u0027The first one was a disaster,\u0027 he said. \u0027I had to redeem myself with the second one.\u0027He added about the duke not having a go: \u0027He didn\u0027t want to do it. I was thinking he might, but he will stick to the soccer later on, I think.\u0027          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex met a youngster taking part in a Gaelic games demonstration          Undeterred by the drizzle, the Duchess of Sussex even braved the grassy pitch in her stiletto heels  In 2011, Harry\u0027s grandparents The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh visited the arena, as part of their historic state visit to IrelandAs the couple walked round the hallowed turf, Meghan in her high heels, one onlooker said: \u0027I would guess that that is the first time a pair of stilettos has been seen on the pitch.\u0027Chatting to youngsters from the hurling pitch, Harry picked up the hurley and said: \u0027That\u0027s really light, isn\u0027t it?\u0027Picking up a goalie\u0027s helmet, Harry asked Tom Whooley, nine, if he had ever been hit in the face by a ball. When he answered no, the duke asked him: \u0027Have you hit a ball into someone else\u0027s face? Not yet? Working on it!\u0027 \u0027Meghan was very well informed about this link and Harry knew a great deal too. They were very conscious of this.\u0027While the couple were viewing the memorial there a handful of cat calls from across the river.          Harry follows in the footsteps of  the Queen the Duke of Edinburgh who visited Ireland\u0027s largest and most iconic sporting arena, as part of their historic state visit to Ireland in 2011          The stadium is the venue for the highest profile events on the Irish sporting calendarOne man and a woman could be heard shouting Sinn Fein slogans and another lone man shouted a crude remark at the duchess. Neither appear to have heard it, however, said Mr Gillespie.The pair also met excitable fans - one of whom said Meghan had \u0027made her life\u0027. Dylan Mahon, who is from Grange Rath, Co Meath, is a member of St Colmcille\u0027s GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association) club who met Harry at Croke Park.Afterwards Harry told him: \u0027You might have a beard soon - you never know!\u0027The visit to Croke Park was a chance for the couple to see children being coached in traditional Irish games. But it was also an opportunity for the duke and duchess, who are on the second day of their tour of Ireland, to see mementos of one of the most notorious days in Anglo-Irish history.On November 21, 1920, British forces opened fire at a Gaelic football match between Tipperary and Dublin, killing 14 spectators and players including the Tipperary captain Michael Hogan.The day, which became known as the original Bloody Sunday, has become enshrined in Irish folklore. But while the atrocity has lost none of its capacity to appal, a historic gesture of peace and forgiveness was made in 2011 when the Queen became the first monarch to be welcomed at Croke Park since the shooting.Now it is firmly on the itinerary for visiting members of the royal family.          At one point, Meghan urged Harry to have a go at hurling, but he politely declined to get involved     The couple chatted with the players who are involved with community outreach projects          Harry gave his wife a stern look as they held hands during their tour around the historic grounds          Croke Park is the headquarters of, the GAA. Prior to the Association buying the stadium in 1913, the grounds were privately owned    The couple were taken on a tour of the stadium\u0027s museum before going on to the pitch for a sports demonstration          The pair were pictured chatting and joking with young gaelic footballers at Croke Park           The Duke and Duchess heard about the important role that GAA plays in Irish life during their trip           The pair, accompanied by a security detail, strolled around the grounds of Croke Park           Meghan\u0027s second and final day in Dublin got off to a busy start performing two engagements before lunch time - and her wardrobe was equally busy          The Duchess of Sussex wore two outfits in the space of an hour and a half, in the form of an estimated total of £17,04 worth of designer labels  Meghan, 36, was pictured in a trouser suit for the first time since her wedding having last worn one to an awards event back in February             The couple looked delighted as they made their way out onto the pitch, despite the dismal weather           The pair were also shown exhibits from Croke Park\u0027s museum, including artefacts from the Bloody Sunday massacre          Meghan, 36, who brought one of her dogs to London when she relocated, looked delighted to meet the president\u0027s pets  As ever, Meghan looked ine in black velvet court shoes and a taupe green dress by designer Roland Mouret    The Duke and Duchess met with the President Michael Higgins at Aras an Uachtarain this morning          The Duchess of Sussex was snapped gazing adoringly at her husband Prince Harry as they attended a formal reception          The pair then made their way to Croke Park museum, home of Ireland\u0027s largest sporting organisation, the Gaelic Athletic Association  Meghan is a known friend of Mouret\u0027s with French designer Roland Mouret making appearances on her now deleted Instagram account so it came as no surprise to see her her opt for one of his pieces today          The Duchess of Sussex looked ready for business in the taupe dress and Fendi handbag - one of her most professional looks          The Duchess giggled as she stroked the large dog - and the pampered pooch looked just as pleased to meet the royal visitor      The Duchess of Sussex looked confident in her role as she smiled for the cameras at the official photo call          The Irish president and his wife looked delighted to meet the newlyweds on the second day of their visit          The Duchess of Sussex was the picture of polished perfection in the grey dress, black bag and black heels          Ireland\u0027s President Michael Higgins embraced the Duchess of Sussex while his wife, a former actress, giggled at a joke she made           Meghan put a hand on Sabina Higgins\u0027 back as they made their way back down to the steps to continue their day of engagements           The President and his wife cheerily waved from the steps of Aras an Uactharain as Meghan and Harry made their way to their car and on to their next engagement           Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex signed only with their first names in a visitor\u0027s book during the Presidential meetingIn a hurry, Meghan?

One containing the opening words of St Matthew\u0027s Gospel \u0027Book of Generation\u0027 and the other St Mark.The book comprises 650 pages on high quality calf velum. Anne -Marie Diffley, visitor services manager, explained to them that it was produced by Columban monks using goose or swan feather quills and brushes made from pine marten fur.The couple then entered the Long Room, which houses 200,000 books, and looked up to admire the huge domed ceiling.They both discussed the distinctive smell,\u0027 said Shenton. \u0027Harry said \u0027ah, leather\u0027, \u0027 she said, while Meghan said \u0027there\u0027s a sweet note to it\u0027.They also saw the Brian Boru Harp, dating from the 15th centur , and long recognised as a historic symbol of Ireland,Meghan was asked about her calligraphy and revealed she is also a book binder. \u0027As they were signing the visitors book, I said to the Duchess: \u0027I know you have done calligraphy \u0027. And she said \u0027yes, and I was a book binder,\u0027 said Shenton.

But it includes stars only paid directly by the licence fee.This means a string of major celebrities, who are paid directly by production companies or the BBC\u0027s commercial arm, can be left out. It is thought a third of the stars who appeared last year may be absent this time.BBC Studios was created to let the corporation sell shows to rival broadcasters and compete with giants such as Netflix.

In underwater parts, they were pulled along in a dream-like state by ers.The treacherous conditions in the cave system were laid bare in the video released by Thai navy Seals yesterday.It shows ers preparing to plunge into murky brown waters likened to ‘cold coffee’.Contrary to the idea that the children would swim out, they appear to be motionless in the video as they are passed along a chain of rescuers including Thai navy personnel and volunteers from around the world.In one section of film shot in a dry part of the cave system, six rescuers grip the handles of a tough plastic cradle carrying their precious young cargo. Other helpers heave on ropes to haul the children up steep sections.Wrapped in foil blankets to keep them warm, the boys are threaded through a claustrophobic tunnel compared to the ‘S-bend’ of a toilet.

Four more were brought out on Monday and the final four and their 25-year-old coach on Tuesday.          The head of the rescue, Narongsak Osottanakorn, revealed yesterday that the cave will be turned into ‘a living museum’          Rescue personnel work at the Tham Luang cave complex, ThailandMr Anderson said ers practised their rescue techniques in a swimming pool with local children about the same height and weight as the members of the Wild Boars football team trapped in the cave.The aim was to make each of the boys ‘tightly packaged’ so ers could keep control of them and adjust their air supply as needed. Mr Anderson said the so-called positive pressure ing masks used by the boys were ‘crucial’.Their use meant that even if a boy panicked during the rescue and got water inside his mask, the pressure would expel it.

And some staff were said to be furious that their pay had been revealed while the pay of others had been kept private.           Gary Lineker has become the BBC\u0027s top earner, raking in up to £1.76million a year  Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans and talkshow host Graham Norton were the second and third best paidOnly 64 people were included in the report for 20172018 compared with 96 in the list for 2016-2017. An unknown number of salaries have been wiped from the figures because rules allow the broadcaster to withhold figures on anyone being paid through the organisation\u0027s commercial arm, BBC Studios.Of those on the list last year, 24 have now had their pay hidden because the programmes they work for moved to BBC Studios. Others have left the corporation.Anyone working through a production company is allowed to have their pay kept secret and BBC Studios was spun off last April so the corporation could start selling shows to rival broadcasters and compete more effectively with giants such as Netflix.Shows created by BBC Studios include Strictly Come Dancing, The One Show, EastEnders and Casualty.      DJ Steve Wright and newsreader Huw Edwards make up the all-male top five  Claudia Winkleman is still the top-paid woman, on up to £379,999. Mary Berry is one of eight women who have joined the listIt emerged that Mary Berry, who is a new entry on the rich list, was handed up to £199,999 just to agree to work with the BBC, it was not a wage for any of her shows.The 83-year-old TV cook fronted three BBC shows – including Classic Mary Berry and Britain\u0027s Best Home Cook – in the last tax year, but all were made by independent production companies, meaning her pay for them was not on the list.Instead, her fee is what she receives for being \u0027talent that you would associate with core BBC programmes,\u0027 a spokesman said.The total bill for the BBC\u0027s executive committee rose by £500,000 to £4.1million for 11 staff. Last night Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said: \u0027Given that we\u0027ve got the football today and the furore over the Brexit White Paper, it\u0027s a brilliant day to bury bad news for the BBC.\u0027The top 12 earners at the BBC are all MEN with Gary...\u0027If only we could have BBC do England and ITV the others\u0027:...Share this article    The pay of household name stars including Tess Daly is not knownBBC stars paid by BBC Studios, a TV production and distribution company, do not have to have their salaries disclosed. The company makes many of the BBC\u0027s popular programmes, but has been a commercial entity since April 2017 and is not funded by licence fee payers. Stars of programmes including Top Gear, Strictly Come Dancing, Planet Earth II, Doctor Who, Mrs Brown\u0027s Boys, EastEnders, Casualty and The One Show - all created by BBC Studios - are off the list, or have just portions of their salaries shown.For example, Strictly Come Dancing presenter Claudia Winkleman was last year in the £450,000 - £499,999 pay bracket, but in the 2018 report, she is in a £370,000 - £379,000 pay bracket for hosting a weekly show on Radio 2 and a \u0027range of programmes and series\u0027 on BBC.Her fee for hosting Strictly now does not appear.Casualty actor Derek Thompson, EastEnders star Danny Dyer and Strictly Come Dancing judge Dame Darcey Bussell are among those who were featured on last year\u0027s list, but have now dropped out.Some of the stars no longer the list: Zoe Ball, who made up to £300,000 in the last pay list, does not appear as  Strictly: It Takes Two is made by BBC StudiosMatt Baker and Alex Jones are also no longer on the list because The One Show is made by BBC Studios                                                     "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/12/00/4E241BC600000578-5944559-image-a-119_1531353493807.jpg","title":"Moment Jordan Pickfords girlfriend realised dreams over","story":"    Megan Davison was photographed in various stages of despair as she watched her goalkeeper boyfriend slump to defeat against Croatia in Moscow\u0027s Luzhniki Stadium          Her 24-year-old boyfriend played well but could do little about his opponents\u0027 extra-time winner, which was scored by striker Mario Mandzukic          Megan puts her hands over her mouth after realising that England\u0027s World Cup campaign in Moscow was finished And after he left the pitch and joined her in the stands, she consoled him as he hung his head in misery. England fans, meanwhile, were left devastated as the nation missed out on a place in the World Cup final.The dream was crushed for supporters in Moscow and at home as Gareth Southgate\u0027s men lost 2-1 to Croatia in the semi-final.     Pickford is consoled by Ashley Young after the Three Lions\u0027 World Cup campaign ended in Moscow           After he left the pitch and joined her in the stands, she consoled him as he hung his head in misery  Pickford, who is from Sunderland and plays for Everton, had a good game but could do little to stop Croatia\u0027s two goals Millions tuned into the eagerly anticipated match, with sorrowful scenes up and down the country after days of singing \u0027It\u0027s coming home\u0027.The Duke of Cambridge took to the official Kensington Palace Twitter account to speak of his pride in the team.Ending the tweet with a W, he wrote: \u0027I know how disappointed @england must feel right now but I couldn\u0027t be more proud of this team and you should hold your heads high.           England fans cried after their defeat to Croatia ended dreams of wining the country\u0027s first World Cup since 1966 as they made their first semi-final in 28 years           England fans look dejected after England lose to Croatia in the World Cup semi-finals in Moscow as they were defeated during their best chance to make the finals in 28 years           Captain Harry Kane looks disappointed following his side\u0027s defeat to Croatia after he led them to their first semi-finals in almost 30 years \u0027You\u0027ve had an incredible #WorldCup, made history, and gave us fans something to believe in.\u0027We know there is more to come from this @england team.\u0027Prime Minister Theresa May said: \u0027Wasn\u0027t to be this time but it\u0027s been a great journey that\u0027s made the country proud.

That is why he has long been so hostile to Britain, which has shown far too great a spirit of independence.Affronted by Brexit, he\u0027s a key architect of the EU\u0027s punishment strategy, compromising a refusal to negotiate constructively on one hand and, on the other, an extortionate demand for a so-called \u0027orce\u0027 settlement.His attitude makes it believable that he was behind the damaging leak about the MayJuncker dinner.Selmayr angrily denied he was behind this character assassination.Yet it seems to fit his anti-British agenda, as well as his record as an intriguer and manipulator.It\u0027s not the first time he\u0027s been accused of leaking to the press to undermine the British side in Brexit negotiations. Selmayr\u0027s attitude may have been triggered by an incident in his youth, when he was briefly a student in London.One evening in 1993, he went to hear Margaret Thatcher speak at an event to promote her memoirs. Although he bought a signed copy, he was appalled to hear her attack the dream of European integration. He came away with a sense that \u0027there is a big misunderstanding between Britain and the EU\u0027.           Juncker, never one distinguished by his own work-rate, calls his Chief of Staff, only half-jokingly, \u0027the Monster\u0027Contemptuous of national borders, laws, self-governance and identity, Selmayr is the classic European ideologue bent. Like one of Robespierre\u0027s unyielding revolutionaries during his French Reign of Terror, he is a political zealot, renowned for his dedication and brutality.Juncker, never one distinguished by his own work-rate, calls him, only half-jokingly, \u0027the Monster\u0027.His commitment is matched by his merciless intimidation which has created its own reign of fear in Brussels.He thrives on such a reputation, boasting that he keeps the Commission and its 35,000 staff under control. As for his Rasputin nickname, he says: \u0027If it means there is an efficient manager, somebody who is not a wimp, I\u0027m OK with that.\u0027 Others are not so happy.In 2016, Kristalina Georgieva, the EU\u0027s Budget Commissioner from Bulgaria, cited the \u0027poisonous\u0027 atmosphere that Selmayr created.A central part of the problem is Selmayr – a lawyer by training – often acts like the Commission President himself. One spoof Twitter account joked that Selmayr is now the \u0027Chef de drinks cabinet\u0027 for Juncker, but that is a gross misreading of the real situation. With typical ambition, Selmayr has exploited his boss\u0027s absences to acquire more political authority than any official in EU history. This, in turn, feeds his epic self-importance.                             Do you know the difference between Selmayr and God? God knows that he\u0027s not Selmayr                        German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble \u0027Do you know the difference between Selmayr and God?\u0027 the long-serving German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble once said. \u0027God knows that he\u0027s not Selmayr.\u0027That spectacular egotism often comes across as political thuggery.As with so many authoritarians, Selmayr seems to believe that the end justifies the means. In his case, the end is the creation of a united, federal Europe. He claims his belief in this vision was fired as a schoolboy, when his maternal grandfather Heinz Gaedecke took him to the First World War battlefields and military cemeteries of the western front, including those at Verdun.The lesson that young Selmayr absorbed from this trip was that Europe must unify to avoid the blood-soaked lessons of the past.But Selmayr also had a direct family connection to the darkest episode in Germany\u0027s history. During the Second World War his grandfather was a Lieutenant Colonel on the Wehrmacht\u0027s staff in the Balkans where he won three bravery awards – including the Iron Cross, first and second class.After the Allies\u0027 victory, Josef Selmayr was tried by a British military tribunal for war crimes, found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in prison. He served only five years, and on his release helped to create West German military intelligence.           Martin Selmayr (pictured second right) enjoys a drink during Oktoberfest in BrusselsThis painful family experience gives Selmayr another link with Juncker, whose father was conscripted into the Wehrmacht.But Martin\u0027s own upbringing was far less clouded by conflict. He has been accused of \u0027bossy, whip-smart legalism\u0027 – his lawyer father was an adviser to the office of the German President. Selmayr joined the EU\u0027s bureaucracy in 2004 at the age of 34.Ferociously ambitious, Selmayr spotted the potential of working for Juncker, whose spongy, erratic character was part of his appeal, as it gave far more scope for his chief of staff to have influence. Juncker duly became EU President in 2014, despite a strong campaign against his candidacy by David Cameron. His henchman Selmayr has been thwarting Britain ever since. He wants victory for the EU and humiliation for us.He was one of the diehard opponents of any concessions being granted to Cameron last year during negotiations for a new British relationship. He is just as uncompromising today over Brexit. But our Government cannot give in to this Teutonic oppression. Martin Selmayr\u0027s undemocratic antics must not be allowed to deny us our freedom and sovereignty."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/12/08/4E26CD1D00000578-5945319-image-a-58_1531379011309.jpg","title":"proud thank Mr Southgate Fans praise Englands World Cup heroes","story":"    Southgate embraces his wife Alison in the empty seats behind the dugout in Moscow Luzhniki stadium after the loss          England fans cling to each other in Hyde Park last night as they come to terms with yet another World Cup defeat  England stars Kyle Walker and Jesse Lingard were among those to speak of their honour and gratitude at representing their country during this World Cup  National captain Harry Kane and Kyle Walker expressed their pain at getting knocked out of the tournament last night as they thanked Three Lions fans for their support          England striker Jamie Vardy was among the stars to express his gratitude for the England fans, adding \u0027thank you to each of you who have been there each step of the way\u0027          England manager Gareth Southgate embraced his wife of more than 20 years after the defeat to Croatia last night          This England fan\u0027s tear-stained face sums up the pain of yet another World Cup defeat for the team last night  Two fans embrace in Hyde Park in London as they consoled one another after the 2-1 defeat to Croatia in Moscow (left) - around two hours earlier they were ecstatic as England scored (right)  England manager Gareth Southgate comforted all the players before he embraced his wife Alison after the defeat to Croatia last night          Dele Alli kisses his girlfriend Ruby Mae in the crowd after a see-saw semi-final where England were on top but lost Some even suggested that England\u0027s heroes should be given a parade to honour their unexpected run in the tournament, a notion quickly shot down by the FA which said it had no plans to hold an official presentation.Hopes were high after Trippier\u0027s stunning free kick sent the nation crazy in a first half where the team missed at least two more excellent opportunities to kill off the game.But Croatia, led by star player Luca Modric, fought their way back and made England pay for their scorned chances, scoring once with 20 minutes to go and again in extra time to break English hearts. Back home thousands of bereft fans struggled to come to terms with yet another defeat in the final stages of a major tournament.Today many fans woke up with a mix of deep sadness and pride, with England now focused on regrouping ahead of the third place playoff with Belgium on Saturday.Theresa May, who was unable to watch the game due to the Nato summit, heaped praise on Southgate and insisted everyone should be proud of what England achieved.England 1-2 Croatia: Heartbreak for the Three Lions as they...Gareth Southgate embraces his wife and teenage children...\u0027I couldn\u0027t be more proud of this team\u0027: Prince William...Share this articleA spokeswoman for the Prime Minister said: \u0027She thinks that he led the team fantastically and that the whole country should be proud of how far England got.\u0027 Meanwhile, Chris Pit tweeted: \u0027Woke up still gutted but thank you Mr Southgate for bringing belief, pride \u0026amp passion back to the England team\u0027, Sam Phillips wrote: \u0027Absolutely gutted!

Planned to stand like an oversize party hat in the garden of John Soane’s sober Dulwich Picture Gallery, the great Technicolor crown is the winning design for the Dulwich Pavilion. The biennial commission, now in its second year, is a youthful alternative to the Serpentine’s established pavilion programme across the river. Selected through an open competition and co-organised with the London Festival of Architecture, it aims to provide a platform for emerging designers rather than global stars, bringing some fresh energy to the oldest purpose-built gallery in the world.“We were trying to imagine what might have happened if Soane had extended his European grand tour to the African continent,” says Dingle Price, one half of Pricegore, the practice behind the winning design, who developed their proposal with furniture designer Yinka Ilori. “We wanted to come up with something that could be more representative of today’s London, and attract a wider range of people to the gallery.”The architects established their office in 2013 down the road in Peckham Rye – the heart of London’s Nigerian population, nicknamed Little Lagos. Ilori, whose parents were born in Nigeria, returns to Lagos several times a year to find inspiration for his bright designs. Their project, nicknamed the Colour Palace, was inspired by the vibrant hues of the Nigerian city, particularly the textile market, where jazzy wax print fabrics are densely hung from simple framed stalls, creating cavernous warrens of clashing patterns.This cornucopia of textiles translated into a piece of architecture takes the form of a bright blue wooden space-frame clad with overlapping layers of square timber battens, painted with alternating geometric patterns on each face. The effect of these multicoloured fringes promises to be mesmerising, with the patterns shifting as you walk around the structure, like a 3D lenticular image, vivid yellow circles melding with hot pink triangles. Raised on chubby red concrete legs, the dazzling cube envelops a flexible circular stage for talks, performances and yoga classes, while a raised gantry will provide theatrical views, encircling the space like a Shakespearean theatre.“The sense of theatricality appealed to me,” says gallery director Jennifer Scott who, with six other judges, selected the design from a shortlist of six, narrowed down from 148 entries. “I love the playfulness and the way the design speaks to a cultural heritage that’s so pertinent to the area.”Without the additional funds raised by selling the pavilion to a private collector, as the Serpentine tends to do each year, the biggest challenge facing the architects is the tight construction budget – a restriction that Soane in the early 19th century also had to deal with. Eight of his schemes for the gallery were rejected, before he was forced to settle on building with exposed brickwork “in a plain and substantial manner”, only using expensive Portland stone in the lantern, frieze and along the base of the building.But the constraints proved to be a boon, prompting a high level of rigour and invention in the layout and natural lighting of the interior, where the gallery spaces are arranged around an amber-windowed mausoleum for the gallery’s founders. Soane’s sequence of top-lit spaces have provided a model for gallery buildings around the world ever since.Dulwich hopes its pavilion budget of just £60,000 will prompt an equal level of ingenuity, and has launched a fundraising drive to meet the target. As for Pricegore and Ilori, may their painted palace usher in a rainbow future, a more joyous strand of architecture that isn’t afraid to indulge in pattern and colour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2302bcc855a481bff2446cdec7ba1e08dbc701c2/61_308_4558_2735/master/4558.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18185b4dad704b83a81574424048699d","title":"biz markie rock steady crew run dmc early hip hop stars in pictures","story":"A new exhibition of street shots from the 1980s captures everyone who was anyone in the early days of hip-hop, from Biz Markie to Run DMC and Rock Steady Crew"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df0c7dadb1dd9f8a2ea26a1c058a68e000460de6/0_625_2391_1435/master/2391.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07f3ad72ad4b3730c032b73b47a6ca19","title":"wearing thanaka rohingya refugee camp in pictures","story":"Swirls of yellow paste made from ground bark decorate the cheeks of Rohingya Muslim women and girls in the refugee camps of Cox’s Bazar in southern Bangladesh.

Beyond advances in the manufacture of clothing, the whims of fashion, and the occasional fad – who remembers Levi’s twisted seam? – cotton has remained cotton, and polyester is still polyester.But an award-winning Italian design duo is trying to realise the potential of smart technology in clothing to improve lives.Emanuela Corti and Ivan Parati, who met while studying at the Polytechnic University of Milan, have developed Sensewear, a collection of smart clothing and accessories for people who suffer from SPD. Also known as sensory integration difficulties, SPD can affect the way people, particularly those on the autism spectrum, process everyday stimuli, from light to touch.Their innovative work won Corti and Parati an AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You Award as part of the AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You programme, which aims to identify inidual champions, innovators and organisations that are creating exciting and pioneering health tech. In addition to winning awards, Corti and Parati’s work has also gained the attention of research academics and manufacturers in Italy.“If it is not treated effectively, it can result in clumsiness, behavioural problems, anxiety, depression or failure at school,” says Corti, a product designer specialising in textiles and furniture. She says hypersensitivity is often part of SPD, which can result in an enhanced sensitivity to sounds, smells and physical contact. “The textures, stitches and labels in regular clothes can cause unsustainably painful reactions,” she says. Left untreated, these symptoms can be disabling, leading to social isolation, anxiety and low self-esteem.The couple, who now have a young daughter, started with comparatively low-tech solutions, looking at the potential for 3D knitting processes, for example, to reduce potential rubbing points. They also looked at ways to redesign – or to build into clothing – some of the specialised toys and medical accessories already available. “Our focus was on incorporating those therapies into everyday objects that would not stigmatise the user as a disabled person,” Corti says. “We wanted to create invisible magic.”But the designers also wanted to think big. What if the elements of a wardrobe could talk to each other? For this, Corti and Parati looked at some of the smart clothing that is starting to become available, typically now targeted at the fitness market, such as Nadi X smart yoga leggings, which pulse on different muscles to encourage correct positions, and the sports vests that measures an athlete’s heart rate and position.“Our smart T-shirt will collect vital data – such as heart rate, breath frequency and movement – which is processed by an app to indicate the stress level of the wearer. It can then trigger the functionalities of other garments in the collection,” says Corti.One such garment is an inflatable pullover, capable of delivering a targeted “hug” to a wearer in need. “Deep pressure or deep touch pressure therapy (DTP) is a firm, tactile sensory input that can consist of firm hugs, stroking or cuddling,” says Corti. “It can have a calming effect on children and adults. Many people affected by autism refuse physical contact with others, but might be happy with a mechanical surrogate.” Other Sensewear innovations include Biteme, a biteable silicon necklace that measures pressure, and an aromatic scarf that can emit familiar, comforting scents.“This is a visionary concept that materialises ideas initially described by Mary Temple Grandin,” says Cesare Furlanello, head of the research group at the Bruno Kessler Foundation in Trento, and an expert in the way machine learning can be applied to biomedical and environmental data. Grandin, now 70, is a US professor of animal science and campaigner for autism awareness. She specialises in the emotional as well as physical welfare of livestock, and also invented a mechanical “hug box” for humans, after noticing how confined cattle calmed down before being inoculated.“As a child, I craved to feel the comfort of being held, but I would pull away when people hugged me,” Grandin wrote in 1992 in a description of the machine, a sort of pneumatic cocoon with pressurised padding that allowed her to control her own hugging. She suffered panic attacks throughout her teenage years before building the device in early adulthood. “Gradually, my tolerance of being held by the squeeze machine grew. Knowing that I could initiate the pressure, and stop it if the stimulation became too intense, helped me to reduce the oversensitivity of my nervous system.”Medical vests that replicate this mechanism have already been developed, but Corti’s priority is to make smart clothing that looks cool. “If you have a difficulty you don’t want people to stare at you, right? You don’t want to feel different,” she says. This summer, a team including Furlanello will introduce some of the Sensewear range to children with autism, to explore its potential to make their lives easier. “Patients are very often reluctant to ‘wear’ cumbersome and ugly scientific devices,” says Furlanello, “but we expect Sensewear smart clothes will be much more acceptable, which will help researchers to collect data and expand the context of the study.”Corti now hopes that the ideas behind Sensewear’s smart clothing might one day find broader applications. “We would like to expand our philosophy to furniture, interior design and objects,” she says. “We think that everyone faces a certain degree of discomfort, so we are also thinking about people who just live in a hectic urban environment and might want protection from overwhelming sensations or stresses.”Imagine having a slow, firm hug, administered automatically and invisibly, on a delayed, crowded commuter train.

He killed Pepe off in a comic strip last year and took legal action against a self-published author who wrote Pepe in to a children’s book that was described by his lawyers, WilmerHale, as espousing “racist, Islamophobic and hate-filled themes”.The law firm, which represented Furie on a pro bono basis, has now announced a win against the Daily Stormer, which it said had removed all images of Pepe the Frog last week. The site, which takes its name from Nazi propaganda paper Der Stürmer, has found remaining online problematic: tech companies Go Daddy and Google refused to host it after it posted a video mocking a woman killed in a car attack at the Charlottesville white supremacist rally last year.Lawyer Louis Tompros told CNET that the Daily Stormer had been forced to remove images of Pepe following Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DCMA) takedown requests. Tompros said that after identifying around 25 appearances of Pepe on the Daily Stormer, WilmerHale sent in DCMA requests, but as soon as the letter went through one web host, the Daily Stormer had moved on to another. But by 2 July, some images were down, and by the following day they had all been removed.“Everything that we identified was taken down,” Tompros told CNET. “It may be that there are new things, or things that popped up more recently, that were not on our list.

While the report, which looks ahead to the challenges faced by major economies over the next 40 years, warns that a global trade war triggered by the US will damage the long-term outlook, it said growth and living standards will continue to rise across the OECD.The report will be welcomed by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who has championed public investment, especially in transport, in his first two budgets.The OECD said the UK had made progress towards reforming its pensions system, liberalising product markets and making the labour market more flexible to improve output and growth, making public investment among the most fruitful policy areas.Pension reforms mean that the UK is less likely to be badly hit than other OECD countries by the extra health and retirement costs stemming from an ageing population."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55c69ac2783d4d2122463a22d26acb23c2254347/0_507_3873_2325/master/3873.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb5ad783543c11bb7a2bc608956020ac","title":"this waterfront needs a highway the huge mistakes cities keep making","story":"Why don’t cities learn from the mistakes others have made? We list the terrible ideas that keep being recycledMaking mistakes is an important part of life. It’s an opportunity for growth and a lesson to others. Unless, of course, you’re a city. Too often, cities think they’re unique and repeat the blunders that others have made before them. Here are three of the worst ideas that keep getting recycled let us know about others in the comments below.The gigantic out-of-town complex Centro was the centrepiece of Oberhausen’s efforts to halt economic decline and turn the German city toward post-industrial success.With glitzy shopping, entertainment venues and cultural offerings in repurposed factory buildings, Centro did indeed have a transformative impact – but not in the way the city imagined. As much of the retail and service activity in the city gravitated to the new mall, many mom-and-pop businesses downtown couldn’t stay afloat. The once-vibrant streets of the city centre were gradually taken over by discount stores, empty shop fronts and visible decay.Devastated by the loss, Oberhausen is now focused on revitalising the downtown area – in short, recovering from its main recovery project.Nor is Oberhausen alone. Many cities have welcomed remote shopping centres in the hope of making economic gains, only to face unintended consequences. So you’d guess new cities would have learned from these mistakes.Guess again. In Finland, the city of Kouvola believed a big shopping mall on the edge of town was just the strategic intervention needed to reinvent a declining economy. Since the mall opened in 2012, Kouvola has been best-known for its dying city centre and the desperate efforts to resuscitate it. And the city of Seinäjoki has enthusiastically approved a new peripheral shopping paradise, arguing that the mall will boost Seinäjoki’s attractiveness as a regional shopping destination, and in some magical way also support the city’s strategy to strengthen its downtown.No guesses as to what will happen next.The “Five Star” development strategy of the city of Tampere involves adding new housing and jobs, a new tram system, and prioritising pedestrians and cyclists. In order to achieve this deluxe downtown experience, the city is building underground parking facilities and a tunnel to clear the roads of cars. A clear and effective concept, one might think.But congestion in the city wasn’t even an issue before the city completed two costly Five Star projects: a 1,000-space parking garage, and a tunneled highway section. The effect has been to increase the number of cars the city centre can accommodate – and the number of cars has duly increased.So how is Tampere responding? It is proposing to to build an additional entry from the tunnel to the city centre – increasing capacity yet further – and planning yet another colossal parking garage. Meanwhile, improvements for pedestrians and cyclists have been minimal. The most remarkable result of the project, many locals now believe, will be its astonishing price tag.The city would have done well to look across the Atlantic for lessons. In the late 1980s, Boston took a leap of faith to see whether burying cars underground could be the magic bullet that could both alleviate congestion and increase downtown walkability. The so-called Big Dig project ambitiously set to ert a downtown expressway into a tunnel, to offer new transit options, and to refurbish the expressway corridor with parks and plazas. What happened? The project was finished a decade later than planned, the construction costs bloated to $15bn, the transit plans were forgotten – and Bostonians today spend more time in traffic than ever.As Jacques Cousteau once wrote: “The Sea, once it casts its spell, holds one in its net of wonder forever.” As “placemaking” has become a key element of the urban economy, some intelligently planned cities have embraced their blue gold. In Oslo, for example, the “Fjord City” strategy has seen the redevelopment of a once-industrial shoreline into vibrant neighbourhoods packed with apartments, jobs, shops and restaurants. Famed for its opera house, Oslo’s waterfront has helped the city to evolve into one of the most competitive in Europe.Other cities prefer to completely ignore these successes and instead repeat the mistakes of the past. In 2015, despite lengthy community campaigns for tearing it down and plans for high-quality waterfront urbanist interventions, Toronto decided to keep the Gardiner Expressway in place, cutting the city’s waterfront off from the rest of its downtown.Other cities swim even harder against the current. The Estonian capital of Tallinn has decided to invest in a brand-new downtown highway, in order to grant easier harbor access to trucks. In the process, it will pave over one of the city’s only seaside parks. As a kind of absurd flourish, the city has promised to build a shiny promenade and public space in the only narrow stretch of land that now remains between the sea and multiple lanes of traffic.

Companies with commercial agendas dressed up as philanthropy – such as Emma’s Diary and Bounty – are promoted to pregnant women via their appointments with midwives or GPs and after childbirth in NHS hospitals.They dangle free gift incentives in front of women, encouraging them to sign up to mailing lists and baby clubs that will share their data (thanks to carefully worded privacy statements) with a wide range of firms – from pharmaceuticals to cars. These firms will go on to bombard them with marketing materials at a time of financial and emotional strain. And now we know that some of the data collected by one company was used for political purposes.The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) revealed today that Emma’s Diary, which provides weekly emails during pregnancy, magazines and a bundle of goodies if you sign up to its app, is potentially in breach of data protection regulation and may face a £140,000 fine. (Emma’s Diary says the ICO findings contain “significant factual innacuracies, which they contest.)The news serves as a signifier for the sometimes shady, usually dysfunctional relationship that society and industry have with motherhood. I already worry about the focus on buying things as opposed to preparing emotionally for the opportunities and challenges of parenting there is a more sinister aspect to the way motherhood and commerce interact here.At a time often underscored by money worries, pregnant women have signed up to Emma’s Diary, a seemingly benign service that offers them items such as a pack of nappies and £200 of Argos vouchers in exchange for due dates, dates of birth of existing children and interaction with an app or ads that further profiles them. The particularly nasty twist highlighted by the ICO is that the data collected has subsequently been used by the Labour party for political campaigning and analytics. Emma’s Diary told the ICO that usage of mothers’ data was fully outlined in its privacy policy at the time. The company later amended its privacy policy to make explicit the potential for customer data to be sold for political purposes.To get to women in the first place, companies such as Emma’s Diary and Bounty (which provide information packs, vouchers and photography services) have exploited the underfunding of antenatal resources and education to provide much-needed online and printed materials, giving a mouthpiece to important health information from midwives and doctors but only on the commercial interest’s terms. For legitimacy and access, the companies have developed partnerships with the Royal College of General Practitioners or the Royal College of Midwives and have permissions that stagger me to distribute their materials using NHS staff as couriers and, in Bounty’s case, by having representatives inside NHS hospitals.Putting aside possible unlawful data use (which feels like the final straw in this story), private companies having access to pregnant women or those recovering from childbirth feels objectively wrong. And if something feels this wrong to so many (more than 60,000 people signed a petition to ban Bounty reps from maternity wards), that is often because it is wrong.This is an industry that relies on access to women, granted by state-funded services, at moments of peak physical and emotional vulnerability. I’ve supported women who felt aggrieved by a Bounty rep visiting them within the first hours after birth and delivering a sales pitch. It seems particularly upsetting in the many cases where women’s partners or supporters were sent home shortly after birth (due to visiting-hour policies) and new mothers found themselves alone on understaffed wards, sometimes unable to access food, water or shower facilities.The selling of data for political purposes also feels like a violation – albeit a different one. Pregnant women and new mothers often talk to me about how infantilised they feel within maternity services and in conversations about their bodies, health and decisions. Any misrepresentation of how data will be collected and the deliberate positioning of these brands as friends when they might be foes is offensive and speaks to the wider lack of respect women encounter on the road to motherhood.Products, services, information and support can be essential tools to smooth the path to parenting. But opaque and misleading commerce has no place inside the NHS.• Rebecca Schiller is the director of the childbirth charity Birthrights"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ac6cdd4ea490473a0a6af3b3830e28297875951/211_130_4747_2848/master/4747.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cc6104c1fcee890245270f9872a91b5","title":"eu britain brexit plan chequers theresa may","story":"Britain is making a fair and reasonable proposal, given the compromises that the government has had to makeDear Ambassadors and High Commissioners,I write regarding the British government’s Chequers plan, a white paper on which is published today. It’s two years since this country voted to leave the EU, and with just months remaining of article 50, I’m sure you will welcome more details on the UK’s Brexit proposals.All of you represent EU member states at the Court of St James’s in London. You must be spending a lot more of your time on Brexit than you would probably like to do. You might think your country didn’t choose Brexit, and that it’s a headache you could do without. But you would also recognise that the EU treaties themselves afford every member an option of leaving the union, in accordance with its constitutional requirements. That’s just what the UK has decided to do.Skilled diplomats, you are used to dealing with the world as it is, not as you would like to find it. And I’ve seen how you and your colleagues have turned your efforts to the challenge of finding a way through Brexit, to making sure that the UK maintains the strongest possible relations with its European neighbours, as they evolve on to a different level.For over four and a half decades, the UK has been a committed EU member, pressing for the completion of the single market and the extension of membership to countries of the former eastern bloc. Yet we always had a more detached relationship than many of our continental allies. We chose not to join the euro and the Schengen area. Frankly, we have always been more interested in a trading relationship than a political project. And liberal Euroscepticism has had a strong foothold here, on the political centre-left and centre-right, and in the press.Although the prime minister, Theresa May, made clear over a year ago that Britain intends to leave the EU’s single market and customs union, it has taken the government too long to come up with a more detailed plan on Brexit. Now, finally, it has.We need a path to a balanced relationship that would work for future decades. Most European leaders agree that this will have to be a bespoke relationship, designed to suit our size and proximity, as well as the historical, economic, personal and cultural ties between the UK and EU.So far, however, the European commission team, which negotiates on your behalf, has only offered the UK two unacceptable choices. On the one hand, Michel Barnier suggests a thin free trade agreement, which comes with the coda that the EU would indefinitely control regulations for the province of Northern Ireland alone – something that many in the UK see as an attempted “annexation”. On the other hand, there’s a relationship even closer than Norway’s, inside a customs union and single market, which would limit the UK’s ability to end free movement or control regulations across its wider economy. The latter would almost certainly prove politically unsustainable in the medium term, and – as we saw with Brexit itself – unsustainable political relationships tend to unwind in the UK.The Chequers plan tries to put forward an innovative, bespoke option for a new partnership with the EU. Essentially, it would entail the UK aligning with EU single market rules on goods, but able to erge on services and end free movement. The purpose would be to maintain essentially frictionless goods trade to support growth in all of our economies, and to avoid a hard border with Ireland.Some on the EU side claim that the free movement of goods, services, people and capital is “inisible”. But the EU has already entered relationships that ide these, and which allow partial participation in the single market – such as those with Switzerland or Ukraine.Others claim the UK wants to have its cake and eat it. Yet the Chequers plan would leave the UK with fewer obligations but also fewer rights. We would lose the ability to set rules on goods regulation, and would lose rights on free movement of services and capital.As a (soon to be) non-member, the UK cannot expect the EU to change its fundamental order to suit us. But equally, the EU should be able to accommodate a deep partnership with Europe’s second biggest economy and major security and military power. Although the UK is just one country, in size we are equivalent to the smallest 19 EU members. It behooves all of us to find a way to work out stable relations on our continent at a time when the transatlantic security alliance itself is at risk, and when all around Europe, and within it, we face unprecedented challenges.Your capitals will be looking closely at the detail of the Chequers plan today. As you will be reporting back – given recent ministerial resignations – this is very close to the maximum compromise the UK could sustain politically. The government has moved substantially to get here.I hope this proposal is taken seriously by European member states and the EU itself. I believe it should provide the basis for a future partnership. But if it’s judged insufficient, then I fear the British people will think that the UK has already made a fair and reasonable offer. They would be very wary of further compromise , and so regrettably our relations will probably end up being looser, with concomitant effects on both sides of the Channel for economic growth and security cooperation in the future.• Henry Newman is the director of Open Europe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74bada3adc0d2552bcea2fd6799575d350b6bfd1/0_65_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60dbe6bb3c46505fc5772491400d13f8","title":"st olaves schools marketisation perfomance table pupils","story":"I suppose we should feel outraged at the damning report into shameful practices at St Olave’s super-selective grammar school, where high-flying pupils, who couldn’t quite fly high enough, were systematically forced out the door halfway through their A-levels. An independent inquiry has now accused the school of treating its students as “collateral damage”, preferring to focus on its institutional reputation rather than the wellbeing of its young people, some of whom were reported to be suicidal at the prospect of rejection and public humiliation.However, my overwhelming response was one of dull resignation. Here we go again: yet another example of how the market approach to schooling has spiralled out of control, exposing the dark side of high-stakes competition within which all schools must jostle for position. It isn’t just the “top end” of the schools market in which pupils are “collateral damage”, though harnessing the outrage of the most powerfully motivated parents in a school like St Olave’s certainly helps to guarantee headlines.Having spent the last year researching a new book – The Best for My Child. Did the schools market deliver? – and looking at the 30 years of education policy since the 1988 Education Act introduced the idea of parent choice and competition, it is clear there are dodgy practices everywhere. Covert selection – schools finding increasingly ingenious ways of keeping out the pupils least likely to succeed – is rife. In the pre-Michael Gove years some pupils were disadvantaged by widespread gaming of the curriculum – the liberal use of qualifications that counted in the performance measure but were less rigorous than GCSEs and limited future opportunities for pupils.The rapid increase in ersity, with thousands of independent state schools contracted to central government rather than operating under the auspices of the local authority, has led to fragmented, weak systems of local oversight making it easier for some schools to cheat.There is no doubt that public accountability in terms of performance tables and Ofsted, introduced after the 1988 act, helped schools get better. Most are now solidly good, safe, well-functioning environments though changes to exams and performance metrics make it hard to carry out accurate like-for-like comparisons in standards. Many more young people are staying on in education and training than was the case 30 years ago, and gaps in attainment are starting to narrow, though some estimates suggest it would take another half century before the poorest children catch up with the better off.Nevertheless, market pressure has encouraged unethical behaviour with headteachers repeatedly obliged to choose between doing what is best for their schools, and what is best for their pupils. Some, like the former head at St Olave’s, come down on the side of the school rather than the pupil. Others may take a hit in their results for “doing the right thing” and the time has come to confront the market failure and consider a new approach.It is unlikely that parent choice and public accountability of school performance are going anywhere soon. We live in an unashamedly consumer society which has reached its tentacles firmly into the public realm. But the market could be tamed by introducing more rigorous local oversight of school admissions and exclusions than we have at present. Prof Becky Allen, who led the research into off-rolling, told me: “Human relationships and a strong regulatory middle tier work together to promote ethnical leadership.”More imaginative ways of holding schools to account need to be developed either by counting the results of the pupils who have left in the performance measures, or introducing area-wide accountability, in which the responsibility for every child in an area becomes the responsibility of all schools in that community. Finally, at a time when employers bemoan the lack of hard and soft skills in young employees, why do we rely so heavily on academic exam results to judge success? What about broader measures of achievement – maybe a real baccalaureate-style qualification – to include personal attributes, technical and vocational qualifications.The best for my childbest for my school approach has run its course. We know now there is “collateral damage” everywhere. Let’s hope the next 30 years can be different.• Fiona Millar is a writer and journalist specialising in education and parenting issues.

In its subtlety, richness and warmth it is entirely beguiling – complex and simple at the same time. It is also very moving. Summer 1993 is about childhood and a child’s fraught relationship to the adult world, and has some of the most miraculous child performances I can remember seeing recently, although the concept of “performances” and “acting” are meaningless with children this young: two little girls of six and three years old. There is something awe-inspiring in realising that, to all intents and purposes, what we are seeing is real. The moment-by-moment interplay of emotions and dramatic gestures between these children is effectively innocent of grownup play-acting and pretend.It is a classic premise for a film about a remembered childhood – although the act of remembering is only implicit, contained in the title. This happened more than 20 years ago. Frida, played by Laia Artigas, is a lonely six-year-old who has been sent away from her home in Barcelona to live with her aunt and uncle and their infant daughter in the countryside: a long, drowsy, lazy summer is in prospect before Frida must enrol at the local school for a new term. But there is nothing idyllic about it. Frida is going away because her mum has just died, and it appears her father had also died, a few years previously. Frida is in shock, or she is simply too young to process what is happening. A mean kid in the first scene jeers at her: “Why aren’t you crying?”Her mum’s brother Esteve (David Verdaguer) has agreed to take in little Frida, and effectively raise her as his own daughter, and he is supported by his partner Marga (Bruna Cusí). They are a relaxed and loving couple, but taking in Frida has clearly not been easy. They have a three-year-old, Anna (Paula Robles), and suddenly giving her this difficult elder sister has messed with the family dynamic and pre-empted the unspoken question of whether they might have another child. Then there are Frida’s grandparents, chiefly her formidable and Catholic grandmother Àvia (Isabel Rocatti) who makes Frida recite the Lord’s Prayer whenever she sees her and makes her carry her late mother’s holy communion certificate with her all the time.And how did Frida’s mother die? The rumours have been getting out among Esteve and Marga’s neighbours. Frida is given blood tests by a local doctor. When she falls and cuts her knee while playing at the local park, paranoid parents grab their own kids and tell them to go nowhere near Frida’s blood – to Marga’s silent rage. And Frida herself makes tiny uncomprehending Anna play dressing-up games in which she will play Frida, and Frida will play her own mum: in heavy makeup, a childish parody of borderline-slutty grownup clothes, while drawling, “Mummy is too tired to play with you, darling” – a poignantly bizarre performance inspired by the jazz sax that just happens to be playing on Esteve’s radio. And then Frida herself becomes increasingly dysfunctional: selfish, petulant, with odd coquettish mannerisms evidently learned from her mother. She is coldly jealous of Anna having a mum and dad, becoming an increasingly disruptive and even malign presence: there is even something of We Need to Talk About Kevin going on. Marga becomes afraid of her, which makes their reconciliation all the more powerful. Simón has a masterly way of controlling long, wordless scenes involving just Frida and Anna: the very essence of kids just aimlessly playing among themselves, and then wonderingly realising that something might be very wrong. The film often just gives us bedtime or bathtime scenes and lets them run to the end in what feels like real time. There is quiet wisdom in that. What a lovely film it is."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2f68320f5a65d5d18670f7db0a19758f8df3066/0_7_3352_2012/master/3352.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49ef79436a22e132b4a566ae4518e822","title":"croatia motivated lack of respect england luka modric","story":"• Real Madrid midfielder says media underestimated his side• ‘They should be more humble and respect their opponents’Luka Modric has accused English journalists and pundits of showing a lack of respect to Croatia’s players and admitted his teammates had used criticism to motivate them to victory against England in their World Cup semi-final.Modric impressed as Croatia came from behind to win after extra time in Moscow but the Real Madrid midfielder was scathing in his reaction towards sections of the English media, some of whom had predicted an easy win for Gareth Southgate’s side.“People were talking … English journalists, pundits from television,” he told ITV. “They underestimated Croatia tonight and that was a huge mistake. All these words from them we take, we were reading and we were saying: ‘OK, today we will see who will be tired.’ They should be more humble and respect their opponents more.“We showed again that we were not tired – we dominated the game mentally and physically.“We should have killed the game even before extra time. This is an amazing achievement for us – it’s a dream come true after such a long time. We are in the final and that is the biggest success in Croatia history. We have to be proud.”Ivan Perisic, who cancelled out Kieran Trippier’s early goal with a fine effort of his own, admitted it was a difficult game but praised his team-mates’ perseverance for coming through a successive third knockout game after extra-time.“We knew what was at stake and how important the semi-final is for a small country like Croatia,” he said. “We started slowly today but we showed our character and again came from a goal behind just like we did in the previous knockout rounds.“Twenty years ago I was back at home in my hometown and I rooted for Croatia wearing the Croatia jersey. I could only dream of playing for my country and scoring one of the most important goals to reach the final.”Defender Sime Vrsaljko was also critical of England’s attempts to find a way back into the game after they fell behind. “The all-round perception was that this is a new-look England who have changed their ways of punting long balls upfield but when we pressed them it turned out that they haven’t,” he said.Croatia’s coach, Zlatko Dalic, said their extra-time victory was deserved and his players were not yet finished despite playing a lot of football in the past three rounds.“We deserved to reach the final. What the lads played tonight was fantasy, they’ve made history,” Dalic said. “This tournament will be won by a team with character. We were 1-0 down in three games in a row. For Croatian football and the country this is history being written – I can’t think of a smaller country to reach the final.”Croatia become the 13th team to contest the final and the first new finalists since Spain in 2010. Since their dream run to the last four in 1998, their first tournament as an independent nation, Croatia have failed to get past the group stage, with every subsequent failing team being compared unfavourably with the heroes of France.“This has been the topic of discussion the past 20 years,” Dalic said. “Maybe that game has historical significance maybe, the dear Lord is giving us the chance to settle a score.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f38900f0d6a88f6e5889c3cf908ce65f5d6003ac/0_125_3332_1999/master/3332.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87f8277b230b2a4d82db1911ab4f9aa1","title":"dejan lovren croatia world cup best defender","story":"Dejan Lovren believes he has proved himself as one of the best defenders in the world after helping to steer Croatia into a first World Cup final, and suggested his team’s ability to see off England at the Luzhniki Stadium boiled down to strength of character.The Liverpool defender, who missed Euro 2016, grew into Wednesday’s semi-final and, seven weeks after enduring crushing disappointment in the Champions League final against Real Madrid, will now confront France on Sunday seeking to secure his country’s first World Cup. Croatia will be motivated further by the chance to avenge their semi-final loss to Les Bleus 20 years ago, though Lovren already feels he has restored his nation’s reputation, as well as his own, at the tournament in Russia.“But this criticism is what gets me more motivated to work harder and prove everyone wrong. Everyone. From today, everyone in Croatia and around the world saw we managed to make history. In 20 years’ time, people will remember us, and not just the team from 1998. That is why I am proud, and now we have one game to make people remember us forever.“It is special history when you look back and see we had to play 120 minutes three times and we still had fresher legs than that England team. The difference was mental because we knew we could write history and we did it.“We went through a lot of shit: war, all these things, and even now the situation is not the best. But it is unbelievable how many talents we have in sport. At basketball, at handball, at water polo, at tennis especially. We have good mothers and fathers, making good love.”Zlatko Dalic’s team, who eventually prevailed courtesy of Mario Mandzukic’s 109th minute winner, will now attempt to recover their energy levels after a third gruelling knockout game in succession that has gone to extra time, with memories of 1998 fuelling their intent. Croatia took the lead at the Stade de France against the World Cup hosts courtesy of Davor Suker, only for Lillian Thuram’s brace to see France through despite Laurent Blanc’s controversial dismissal.“I was nine and I remember my mum was screaming and crying after the French game,” said Lovren. “Maybe it’s our time for revenge. It’s going to be a tough game, it will be difficult, but we have a good chance to give them something back for 20 years ago.“For me, it is beautiful. If somebody had told me at the beginning of the season that I would play in two of the biggest finals in the world, I would have signed up straight away. I went through a lot of shit. Unfortunately I didn’t win the Champions League, but there is still this. I believed more that I could win the Champions League – I believe that from day one because we had the power and speed at Liverpool – than coming here to Russia. Here we have different players, but we have showed we can manage. France are definitely the favourites, there is no hiding from that, but we love to be the underdogs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1d5ab98f294ce86c021f9f74765d8ee2159e52/315_81_1460_876/master/1460.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa110925d968f9778d20eafa30b0eb44","title":"england dream over itv roy keane ian wright tv","story":"The absence of Slaven Bilic from the studio was an early blow but later Keane seemed to take a little bit too much pleasure in England’s defeat for Ian Wright’s likingBefore kick-off ITV tried to enhance the excitement by transmitting rallying cries from Joanna Lumley and Prince William, plus footage of Ricky Gervais interviewing a dog. That turned out to be more tolerable than Gabby Logan’s interview with Harry Maguire on the BBC the day before, when Logan was reduced to asking the centre-back whether he liked tea and where he got his head. Uncharacteristic for Logan but symptomatic of a tournament in which the BBC have mostly been outplayed by their rivals.It was a blow, however, that ITV’s four-man panel for this one did not include Slaven Bilic, the Croatian having asked to cover the match from the stadium. Bilic has created gripping dramatic tension in the studio throughout this tournament, using expansive arm movements to illustrate his points and almost literally to poke those around him, a habit that seemed certain to culminate in Roy Keane sticking the nut on him. Defusing that by allowing Bilic to go to the Luzhniki did the watching millions a disservice.At least Bilic appeared pitchside, expressing his confidence that England’s “very open football” would play to Croatia’s strengths. “It’s going to be the kind of game we’re good at,” he reckoned.In the studio Keane was to act as a counterweight to English giddiness - or “to restore some calm,” as Mark Pougatch put it rumly. But Gary Neville, Ian Wright and Lee Dixon were not getting carried away. Wright even opted for his tamest shirt of the campaign, a marine blue number with sharks or dolphins. Dolphins are playful and intelligent. Perhaps some cute subliminal messaging there from Wrighty.The English trio tentatively predicted a win for the Three Lions. Keane did not commit to tackling that view. “If they show enough courage, they’ll win the game but they’ve been in this position before and messed things up so let’s see,” he advised.Once the game got going so did Clive Tyldesley, acclaiming “a Bolshoi spin by Lingard” early doors. When England took the lead, the commentator felt no spin was required, just a statement of facts: “It’s in! Kieran Trippier’s first goal for England is in a World Cup semi-final inside five minutes. Dreams do come true.” To which Glenn Hoddle, with not quite the same sense of moment, added: “It was central, as I said.”Less than 10 minutes later Tyldesley captured the nation’s mood by swooning as Maguire got his head to a corner. “What a threat he carries!” simpered the commentator, who almost choked on his “oh!” when Harry Kane bungled a later chance.At half-time the lads in the studio were concerned England were not further in front. Keane said sloppiness had crept into their play. “If England don’t finish this off, they’ll never forgive themselves,” he warned. Bilic was nowhere to be seen. But he was probably wrapping his arms round someone in the 68th minute when Ivan Perisic scored. Tyldesley paused before reporting: “Croatia have equalised. Really good cross, good run, good finish. England have got to pull themselves together.” By the 84th minute Tyldesley was annoyed enough to quip: “I thought Croatia were supposed to get tired”, a rebuke to Neville, who had declared “if it goes to stamina, we win”.Full-time came with the game in the balance but Tyldesley seemed in need of a hug as he cut to ads.Soon Mario Mandzukic struck Croatia’s second. “Oh, it’s in!” yelped Tyldesley in horror. From then on it seemed he was just waiting for a chance to lie down and sob. Bilic popped up again after Croatia’s win was confirmed. “It’s good for all smaller countries, and also for Wales,” he ventured, mischievously shoving pressure on to Ryan Giggs, standing within arm’s reach to his right.So England were out. But, in a sense, Keane’s tournament was just beginning. This was his time to shine. Wright felt he had been waiting for it all along. “You weren’t happy for us being happy,” he blurted. “I didn’t mind you being happy but you were getting carried away,” retorted Keane.“You were planning the final, where the parades were, you need a reality check – you’re a grown man!” To which Wright replied by mocking his accent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/535759bdb997f0dbc88cde23fe878fa3c865c2eb/599_271_2495_1497/master/2495.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc=\u0026amp;s=1c26d2b99b3c43ab32dffcee7d2c35cb","title":"england unbelievably inferior croatia press world cup semi final","story":"A wave of euphoria hit Croatia after the national team defeated England 2-1 in the World Cup semi-final and, befitting the historic achievement, it was a wave of epic proportions.The Vecernji list newspaper went with the headline “We knocked the English down, Croatia are in the World Cup final!”, with Zeljko Jankovic writing how Croatia and France will now decide “who plays the best football on the planet at the moment”. It turned out to be rhetorical as he answered it himself by adding: “It’s Croatia, don’t even doubt that!” Vecernji’s website devoted an unusual amount of space to gloating over the fate of the losing team, with headlines such as “Football’s not coming home”, “The arrogance hit them back”, “The English are sore losers” and even published a photo gallery titled “Look how the English cry after losing to Croatia” with pictures of downbeat players and fans.The 24 sata daily published a video from the team’s hotel, where players can be seen standing on a dinner table and singing along with veteran entertainer Mladen Grdovic. “Pinch yourself and don’t worry, you aren’t dreaming, this is reality,” wrote Marko Snidaric. “Close your eyes without any fear, and when you open them you’ll see Croatia celebrating. You’ll see Croatia crying. Out of happiness.”Jutarnji list gave central space to quotes from players. “Croatia is burning, but we haven’t burned down yet”, Danijel Subasic said. Sportske novosti, the nation’s only daily sports newspaper, was full of praise for the manager, Zlatko Dalic, claiming he has outdone every other Croatia coach by leading the team to the final. “France, who are better than England, can hardly stop them”, wrote Drazen Antolic. “That will be a true final, a top clash between the two sides who have shown the most at the tournament.”Index.hr, a popular website, acknowledged that England were the better side in the first half, but when Ivan Perisic scored, Sasa Cobanov said, “it was the beginning of the end for the English”.Telesport’s Juraj Vrdoljak compared Croatia’s second-half comeback to an “adrenaline-driven man lifting a truck to save his child”. Croatia emerged victorious, he stated, after “clinching her teeth and biting on a knife in the manner of Cholo’s commandos before using it to rip the history apart at the finishing line”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9127d4dbac7e1152ff00440e17de1a4ba803fa5/0_43_2094_1256/master/2094.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70354f49e1f294c469c04da6e8c1f77f","title":"kyle walker england world cup prove people wrong gareth southgate","story":"• Defender contrasts reaction with what followed Iceland defeat• Walker says Gareth Southgate ‘needs to take the most credit’Kyle Walker believes England “brought the nation together” by reaching the World Cup semi-finals and proved their critics wrong in the process, with the Manchester City defender singling out Gareth Southgate as the man who deserves the credit for transforming the fortunes of a team that had been pilloried after losing against Iceland two years earlier.Although Walker described the players as “absolutely gutted” to miss out on a place in the World Cup final, he said they could take great encouragement from the emotional scenes at the end of Wednesday night’s defeat against Croatia, when England fans showed their respect for the team’s performances in Russia by staying behind to applaud the players and singing their names.“I was there in France, in the Iceland game, and it was completely different to that,” said Walker, recalling that chastening 2-1 defeat under Roy Hodgson. “For them to still be singing when we’re seeing friends and families, chanting our names and singing the manager’s name, is completely different. And I think we need to take full credit for that because we’ve changed that.“I think the football has brought the nation together, people are going to pubs and celebrating, and that’s what football should be about. It’s enjoyable, we all love to play the game and fans love to support it. So it’s hats off to us. It’s unlucky we couldn’t bring it home for them, but hopefully there’s time in the future.”Asked what the biggest thing he would take from this World Cup would be, Walker replied: “I think for me it’s proving people wrong. There’s nothing better, when people are writing you off and saying ‘you’re not fit to wear the shirt’, slagging people off, it’s kind of saying: ‘Well, there you go – have that back at you.’ But we do it for ourselves as well. I can’t tell you how proud I am to share the dressing room with these players. We’ve all grown up watching England and to represent your country at a semi-final of a World Cup, there’s no better feeling.”Walker talked about a huge shift in the way that the national side are viewed after years of apathy and frustration – “We’ve brought fans back in love with the English team” – and he could not speak highly enough of the part that Southgate has played in helping to turn things around by instilling the players with the belief to go out and express themselves.“The man’s a gentleman that’s the best way to describe him,” Walker said of the manager. “He’s been in our shoes. He relates to us massively. He knows what to say at the right time. And he makes you feel like you’re the best player in the world. He gives you that confidence, and I think that he needs to take the most credit out of everyone of us. We’re the guys who are running on the pitch but he’s the backbone of this team. He’s made sure that everyone has stuck together through good and bad moments, and made sure our feet stayed on the floor. I can’t put into words how much credit he deserves for this.”Although Walker said there was a feeling it was “written in the stars for you to go to the final and hopefully do something special” when Kieran Trippier scored a terrific free-kick after five minutes against Croatia, he acknowledged that their opponents were a totally different proposition in the second half and wished them well in the final.Walker insisted England would be motivated to beat Belgium on Saturday and finish third “because they got one over on us in the group stage”, and went onto speak about using this World Cup as a platform for future success. “I think we’ve built a house here now on good foundations,” he said. “I think before probably it was built on sand. But now it’s got a good foundation, so we just need to build on that and make sure we build an empire from it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/439700b5af2f6824940b2d315e91c8d967b03080/0_96_5507_3305/master/5507.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f0a216888de3812a46fe26ef5d0af9d","title":"transfer roundup fulham sign 25m jean michael seri nice kenedy chelsea","story":"Fulham have beaten off competition from several European clubs to sign the Nice and Ivory Coast midfielder Jean Michaël Seri for a club-record fee in the region of £25m, on an initial four-year contract.The deal represents a significant coup for Slavisa Jokanovic, the Fulham head coach, given Chelsea, West Ham United, Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund, among others, were also credited with an interest in the 26-year-old. But, Fulham moved quickly to make Seri their maiden summer signing following promotion to the Premier League. Fulham have also confirmed the signing of Seri’s former Nice team-mate, the 28-year-old defender Maxime Le Marchand, to take their summer business north of £30m. They remain intent on adding former loanee Aleksandar Mitrovic on a permanent deal, while Jokanovic is also keen on Dedryck Boyata, the Celtic and Belgium defender.“He’s been at the very top of our target list for a long time,” said Tony Khan, the Fulham sporting director. “This is a big day for Fulham.” Seri has signed a four-year deal at Craven Cottage until 2022, subject to international clearance and obtaining a work permit, while the club have the option to activate a 12-month extension clause in his contract. His first taste of English football could be as early as Saturday, in a pre-season friendly against Reading, before a swift return to France, as Fulham head off to their training camp in Évian-les-Bains, where they will play Lyon.Meanwhile, Newcastle United have re-signed the Chelsea winger Kenedy on a season-long loan.

Meanwhile, the midfielder Mikel Merino is close to joining Real Sociedad having determined to leave Newcastle after losing his first team place in the second half of last season.“I’m really pleased to have Kenedy back with us,” Benítez. “I’m sure every fan will be happy with this signing. “Hopefully he can keep playing at the same level that he reached with us last season.

We should have known, really, when our visions started to include footballers riding unicorns, or flinging bright blue rubber chickens at each other. None of this was real. Britons scavenging their wardrobes for pairs of shorts and flip-flops to wear day after pitiless, scorching day of unbroken sunshine, and hauling themselves to big screens where jubilant hordes flung beer in the air and over themselves and each other in carefree celebration. None of this was real, and it never could be. The sun did not shine, the net did not bulge, the rubber chicken was not tossed, the beer was never airborne.We awoke, shaken and confused, to the words of Luka Modric, crowing after yet another predictable English World Cup elimination, talking of a nation that “underestimated Croatia and that was a huge mistake”. He went on: “People were talking … English journalists, pundits from television. All these words from them we take, we were reading and we were saying: ‘OK, today we will see who will be tired.’ They should be more humble and respect their opponents more.”Yep, that sounds like miserable, familiar reality alright. Same old England, forever powered by hype and hostility. But in our dream the team was waved from these shores in hope rather than expectation, their limitations evident and acknowledged, their humility unexpected and enchanting. This was not a normal England team, full of swagger and stardust. Success was grafted for, not granted. The team in our dream had done away with celebrity. Goldenballs out, Slabheads in. Mind, people known as Slabhead don’t win the World Cup. They don’t even win the pub quiz. But they can stand tall and strong, they can push themselves to the limit, they can show the world that, with the right spirit, the right friends and the gift of an outsized cranium, anything, or very nearly anything, is possible.The morning after, Kyle Walker was still living the dream, or at least a version of it. He spoke of existing in “a time where sometimes it’s easier to be negative than positive, or to ide than to unite”, and urged the nation to “keep this unity alive”. Sure, football isn’t coming home quite yet, but maybe, in the words of a tune that has been stuck in The FiveЯ’s head of late as we have lain, feverish and clammy, living this bizarre footballing fantasy, it can make us whole again.

I know both fixtures are not totally meaningless (one determined order of qualification from the group, the other the Bronze Medal) but they are basically both games neither side waswill be gutted to lose.” Way to stoke the hype, Andrew! On that note, it’ll be interesting to see how many of his “first team” Southgate chooses to start with.“I personally just hope the final is good,” announces Ruth Purdue. “But I know Deschamps will be himself and I fear what that will mean for the game.” Your fears are well-founded, Ruth. And you can blame Australia for that. Deschamps attempted to show a bit of derring-do in his selection for the first game but Aussie resistance was so strong - or, to put it another way, Ousmane Dembele and Corentin Tolisso were so ineffective - that Deschamps reverted to experience and solidity, bringing back Giroud and Matuidi. They will aim to suppress Croatia. Entertainment’s got nothing to do with it. That’s what the third-place playoff is for.If you want to keep track of all the latest transfers, then here’s where you want to go: Now that the World Cup is nearly over, perhaps you want to start getting excited about the forthcoming Premier League season? Fulham fans probably are probably doing just that today and here’s their guv’nor confirming another new signing.“Did Croatia save the world cup?” wonders Robert Lowery. “While I have sympathy for both the ‘you can only beat what you are put up against’ and ‘teams grow in tournaments’ arguments, I look at the starting England 11 last night and say a pretty bang average upper mid-tier European side. The World Cup stands as one of very few competitions in field sports where outrageous fortune has , while deciding inidual games, not been able to swing whole tournaments beyond the reaches of the handful of better sides coming into a tournament ( exception 1954 perhaps).....If England had done a Greece and won the thing, or even had a run to the final in the manner of a relegation threatened Premier League side getting to Wembley, what then for La Copa Mundiale as a true measure of quality? So yes, Croatia basically saved the World Cup.”Speaking of ITV, have a gander at this. Observe, in particular, some of Keane’s subtle facial expressions: the hint of a grimace, the fleeting flash of a smirk, the unspoken threat of war till death. ITV have announced that 26.6m watched England’s defeat to Croatia on their channel last night. Yes, well done. The question is, how many would have watched it on ITV if it had also been available elsewhere? I would have, for one, because the BBC has had a mostly dull tournament.More from the Gareth Southgate is a Gentleman department: Following up our discussion of Harry Kane’s tournament, Michael writes: “Certainly Harry Kane should have done better with that one chance he had last night, but the fact that that’s probably the only gaping miss we can point to (other than the scuffed header) speaks to England’s big problem throughout the tournament – a lack of creativity. Last night our inexperience and lack of creativity in the midfield came home to roost as we met a side which had both in abundance. Yes ,some of Kane’s goals may have been slightly fortuitous in this tournament but he still scored 6 of them and will probably go home with the Golden boot. I dread to think where we’d be without Kane. Especially in that Colombia game, his ruthlessness from the penalty spot and composure on the ball set the tone for that eventual victory. A fully fit or sharper Kane may have made the difference last night but ultimately if we’re to be successful we need to solve the underlying problem and find our own Luka Modric. At club level he has Dele and Eriksen. With England he’s forced to drop back and be his own Eriksen. If we had a player to fill that role, we can see more of Kane in the penalty box. However, it’s also worth pointing out that Kane’s hold-up and link-up play is a big and underrated part of his game and at certain stages in this tournament we’ve been glad to have him there, winning free kicks and holding the ball up.” So what you’re saying, in short, is what I already said? Except I never suggested Kane was not fully fit, and nor did Southgate.All this talk of the Ballon d’Or, and nary a mention of a Fulham player. Time to right that wrong: All that Ballon d’Or talk - OK, one comment - and nary a mention of Cristiano Ronaldo. So let’s stick up a piece about what his time at Real Madrid meant. No one better than Sid Lowe to sum it all up:Lots of folks slagging off Lovren for his self-congratulation but, in fairness, the guy’s entitled to savour his moment after all the flak he received when playing badly. The best defender in the tournament so far has, of course, been Raphael Varane. Advised to accentuate the positive, Latha Ramanathan has found an upside to England’s elimination: “At least the tennis players at Wimbledon will be relieved not having to answer ‘coming home’ questions!” she says with a chortle. Dejan Lovren spoke to BeIN Sports after the match last night and said: “I took Liverpool to the final of the Champions League. Now with my national team we are in the final. I think people should recognise that I am also one of the best defenders in the world and not just talk nonsense.” If they beat France on Sunday, it’s been Lovren and Modric for the Ballon d’Or, right?“On the subject of Croatia’s equaliser, Robert Speed complains about a high foot from Perisic,” notes Gary Bryne. “More of a low head from Walker methinks.” Agreed, but Walker had to go for it with his head. “I wonder if Croatia should be counted as the 13th or 14th country in the final given that West Germany, like Czechoslovakia, no longer exists,” quibbles Darren Hall. That’s some pesky nitpicking! Is there such a thing as lucky 14th? Perhaps we’ll find out on Sunday.“You said you were going to share your thoughts on Keane but you haven’t,” complains Brad Wilby. “Did you bottle it?” No, I just forgot like a no-good human. The thing about Keane is he’s no longer a hard man. By that I mean he has assigned himself an easy role, the denouncer of clear idiosyncrasies and imperfections rather than a provider of true insight. Having said that, his jousting with Ian Wright last night made for entertaining television - it’s just a pity they weren’t allowed to see it through to the end, which, I assume, would have been both men finding common ground, albeit on which to stage a fight. More on that here:“I think England’s performance in this tournament will be judged on what happens in the future,” declares Adrian Foster. “If we go back to getting beat in the second round or the quarter finals, it will be seen as the tournament where we were good at corners and got lucky in the draw. But if Gareth Southgate can use the goodwill from this tournament and turn it into regular semi-final and final appearances then this might be seen as the start of a change of culture for English football. There’s a lot of similarities between England now and Germany in 2006 success at youth level followed by better than expected performance at senior level. And remember the Semi finals and final of Euro 2020 is at Wembley. Having said all that we really, really missed Adam Lallana last night.” Phew! Thought for a minute you were going to grumble about Southgate not taking Jack Wilshere.Here are some headlines from the Croatian press this morning, brought to you in association with an online translation gizmo: Jutarnji list: “The fiery miracle!”24sata.hr: “Croatia is in the final! Celebrate guys, you deserve it. Is this a dream? We’re in the final: weep, hug, celebrate.”Slobodna Dalmacija: “Wonderful, incredible Croatia! Brave, combative and fiery, Croatia is writing football history, the ‘lucky’ 13th World Cup finalist, as the second-smallest country.” Yes, only 13 countries have ever been to a World Cup final and one of them (Czechoslovakia) no longer exists. The smallest, of course, is Uruguay, world champions in 1930 and 1950. It’s nice, in a way, to have a someone new in there this time, isn’t it? Gives inspiration to so many others. Who wants to talk about Harry Kane? When England face Belgium in Saturday’s third-place playoff, he will be hoping to preserve his two-goal lead over Romelu Lukaku at the top of the scoring charts. But even if he were to return with the Golden Boot, did he have a good tournament? Better than two years ago, sure, but really good? His six goals so far include two fine predatory strikes in the first game, three penalties and an unwitting deflection. Which is not to say he fluffed lots of other chances - he patently didn’t, apart from a couple against Croatia. He spent most of the tournament with his back to goal and away from the danger zone, sometimes holding the ball up, winning freekicks or making inconsequential passes in his own half. But was that his fault or the blame of the midfielders?“As an Australian who’s been blasting It’s Coming Home and World in Motion (the superior English footballing anthem) non-stop for the past two weeks, I feel like the ICH phenomenon is a very British (and by extension Australian, Kiwi, etc) phenomenon of taking the mickey out of yourself before everyone else can,” explains Marco Jeffrey. “If any English supporter showed any earnest belief that England were any good to a non-English football fan, they’d be endlessly derided for any result bar a 3-0 final victory. However, the extremity and almost absurd surety of ICH disguises said earnest belief in enough self-deprecation you can get away with it - and could have all the way to the final.”Hello. Doyle here.

When the captain, Hugo Lloris, addressed the press after the Belgium game, the defeat in the final against Portugal two years ago was the first thing he brought up. Lloris and Pogba had started that match, and so did Samuel Umtiti, Matuidi, Antoine Griezmann and Olivier Giroud.Ah player ratings, the most thankless of tasks. Stuart James drew the short straw last night and his eye was caught by the work of Ivan Perisic and Harry Maguire.On a similar theme, I’m sure we’ll end up with an unlikely team of the tournament as well.Hopefully Luca Modric will win the Ballon D\u0027Or this year.

From spaghetti to cheese strings and strawberry laces, they offer a prolonged eating experience – stretching, slurping, sucking – which brings out my inner Augustus Gloop. Long foods offer a green light to eat with your hands, make a mess and, perhaps more than usual, turn eating into a multi-sensory theme park.So imagine my excitement at the promise of Chinese restaurant Murger Hanhan’s 12-foot noodles, a glee that most closely resembled the pink-cheeked emoji with the wiggly fingers. Gimme! And it is apt that I thought in emoji: 12-foot noodles sound like the very definition of a millennial fad, all appearance over substance, made for the Instagram generation. Inevitably, it is social media and a click-hungry press who have objectified the noodles thus: Murger Hanhan, just off Piccadilly in central London, specialises in the cuisine of Xi’an, a city in China’s Shaanxi province, and – as is authentic – its menu lists these starchy colossi with their true, onomatopoeic moniker “Biang Biang Mian”. In Xi’an, they are defined not by their length but by the noise they make – “bang, bang!” – when they are made.I went to Murger Hanhan to watch the process and eat the results. Chef Michael Lee took two sausage-shaped morsels of dough – made that morning simply with flour, water and salt, then brushed with oil – and began to rolled them out on a work surface. Sausages fast became elastic ribbons, which Lee undulated and whacked against the stainless steel before folding them to stretch still more, then ripping them in half from top to bottom to double their length in an instant. It was delightfully deft, although if you come expecting to see a chef make a noodle that is actually 12 feet long, you might be disappointed. Twelve feet is actually the cumulative length of two noodles stuck together after they have been boiled in a frothing wok of water even then I’m not sure they’re really twice the height of my dad.But still, they are very long noodles – and wide, too, a good two inches. Once boiled, they are thrown into a deep bowl with soy, vinegar and bang bang sauce (onion, garlic, chilli). Black ribbons of fungus, cubes of boiled potato, blanched pak choi and Chinese leaves, a tomato and scrambled-egg sauce (looks weird, tastes great), sour pork, ginger, spring onions and chilli oil are all added into the mix (typically for Xi’an, the flavours have bang, too). Xi’an is known for using more wheat than rice – it is located in the Guanzhong Plain, where there is lower rainfall than elsewhere in China – so the combination of wheat noodles and punchy condiments in biang biang mian is a representative bowlful of the cuisine.Even if your chopstick swag is significantly better than mine, this dish probably isn’t the best choice for a date. It’s a hunched, unwieldy, slappy affair – less Lady and the Tramp eating spaghetti by moonlight, more Jaws – but it’s as tactile as I’d hoped, the thick, doughy belts of noodle hugging my tongue alongside the pak choi’s crunch, the egg and tomato’s velvet sweetness, the sauce’s umami piquancy. It’s a generous portion of deliciousness for the reasonable sum of £10.80. More biang biang for your buck."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1141fb6edd6001ac938e33e8af75589ad35a10b6/0_1637_2912_1747/master/2912.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63692a83aca34e589522e5201261b384","title":"if you end a meal with a clean shirt you are not eating properly jay rayner","story":"The souvenirs of a tikka masala, tomato sauce or a Chinese meal down your shirt front are nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, it should be a badge of prideRecently, in a restaurant, I saw something astonishing. It’s not an uncommon something I see it regularly. It just always astonishes me. What I saw was a middle-aged man in a white shirt, rising from a table, having finished dinner. And there was not a single sauce stain on him. Not a drip or smear, not a dollop or splatter. It was just one crisp snowfield of pristine linen.How, in the name of all that is holy – and quite a few things that aren’t – does this work? Because I seem completely incapable of leaving a table without everyone being able to read, from the full Jackson Pollock across my chest, exactly what I’ve just had for my tea. Ah, so you went for the bouillabaisse followed by the cheesecake in a raspberry coulis, did you? Oh, so it was curry night, was it? Well, of course, that whole linguine vongole thing is tricky, isn’t it?You’re telling me. I have measured out my life in ruined shirts in turmeric stains the colour of that medicinal iodine we called “yellow magic” that was swabbed onto our scabbed knees at primary school. I have lived through the era of chicken tikka masala and the chilli-oil years. Most people view a dish of handmade pasta with a long-simmered sauce of heritage tomatoes as representative of the eternal verities of Italian peasant life I see it as one calamitous laundry bill.I am used to my beloved looking me up and down from the other side of the table and mouthing the words “well done” because I have somehow got through the main course unscathed, like I’m six and have dressed myself unaided. However, she always mouths too soon. Because, only minutes later, the chocolate sauce will doubtless cascade down me like a mudslide after the rains.In my more fragile moments I like to think of myself as a victim of heredity, because my late mother was also incapable of not wearing her lunch. “Oh look,” she would say, dabbing at her blouse with a moistened napkin, “I’ve schtunked”, swiftly turning the Yiddish for stinker into something much more onomatopoeically descriptive.Then again, she had the excuse of a sizable shelf which, even in my chunkier days, I cannot claim. She wore a lot of floral prints which covered a multitude of stains.Being more generous to myself, I reach for another explanation. I make a mess of my clothes at the table because I take the business of eating seriously. The ones who manage not to spill everything down their shirts are obviously not doing food properly. They must be half-filling every spoon’s bowl. They must lean in over their barely laden fork, top lip trembling with the effort. Me? I’m shovelling the food away, like a builder digging the foundations of a new home.There are even some occasions when I revel in my slovenliness. If I rise from a meal in a Chinese restaurant, and the paper tablecloth around where each dish stood doesn’t look like a blast zone of scattered food, then I regard myself as having in some way failed. And if I glance across at someone else’s table and it’s pristine, then I involuntarily mouth the word “amateur”. The interplay of bowl, chopstick and Chinese cooking demands mess. And yet the shirt stains still bother me. I like to think of myself as a man of the world. I like to think of myself as elegant and mature. In truth, I am just one massive splatter of lunch waiting to happen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa0c4bf993d601893e45278f3c322798fa928481/0_301_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5c58ec0ebc5712c078437afa1a1fcfa","title":"ready for your selfie why public spaces are being insta designed","story":"First it was our food. Now whole neighbourhoods are being styled to look good on social media. But by viewing the world through a screen, do we miss the bigger picture?If you are ever in Madrid and looking for a bite to eat, you could do worse than to head to Sobrino de Botín. At the world’s oldest restaurant – it opened in 1725 – you can experience a well-reviewed suckling pig supper, while soaking up the atmosphere. It was once frequented by Ernest Hemingway and is still hugely popular, but that has not stopped TripAdvisor reviewers describing it as “cramped” with “narrow stairs”. In the 18th century, lighting and ambience would have come secondary to the food and some good booze (as Hemingway himself said: “My only regret in life is that I did not drink more wine”), but in 2018 the customer demands much more. In this digital age, the places we choose to visit, eat and stay at increasingly need to be Instagrammable. Design has become, if not all, then at least the starter and the dessert.This new priority doesn’t just mean creating food that can be photographed for social media, although plenty of eateries already cater to that need with the likes of grey ice cream and multicoloured bagels. Instead, the challenge for businesses is to make their premises attractive to social media influencers, so they pose up a storm in front of your store or hotel, luring in followers hungry for the perfect photo opportunity.Evelyn’s Cafe Bar, in Manchester’s Northern Quarter, has capitalised on the modern customer’s desire for a photogenic backdrop. Angus Pride, the manager, says he was inspired by cafe culture in Los Angeles, “as that felt most aligned to the concept of Eastern and Middle Eastern small and large plates we deliver”. Social media imagery was never part of the bar’s original plan, but “when we realised we were so ‘Instafriendly’, we adapted our approach and it’s now key to everything we do.” The cafe uses a mixture of textures and materials and is full of the obligatory hanging plants, but, says Pride, it puts a premium on design that has “longevity over something more contrived for the purposes of social media”. It is not just interiors that are being reshaped. Renowned architect Richard Rogers considers the Tuscan town of Pienza, now a world heritage site, as the first great attempt at a humanist urban design. Under Pope Pius II, the town was remodelled in 1459 around a main square that feels like an outdoor room - encouraging visitors to linger and revel in its beauty. When I lived in Shoreditch in London, I often wondered what the Pius would make of the way it does the same, but in a very different way.Shoreditch, often prefixed with the word “trendy”, works hard to seduce anyone with a smartphone. Its cafes and restaurants are stuffed with hanging plants, rose gold and inspirational signs, details designed to be featured online. Because of the murals, pop-up shops and famous flower market, this often means a quick dash to the shop for milk is hampered by tourists’ impromptu photoshoots, thanks to the endless opportunities for stylised social media posts. A day spent in Shoreditch, a place where everyone’s gaze is filtered through a lens, can begin to feel almost unreal.The spectacular regeneration of King’s Cross in London in recent years has gone further. Glittering glass buildings have shot up alongside plant-covered walls, colour-changing fountains and kitsch billboards. Every part of the area now features something that looks like a prop - from steps covered in fake grass where people eat lunch to a giant neon swing that cries out to be photographed. Then, at King’s Cross station, there is the fictional platform 9¾ that featured in the Harry Potter books, where fans queue to “crash” through the barrier. There is even a professional photographer to mark your moment.Kate Beavis, an expert in vintage interiors, thinks this kind of pop-up urbanism is becoming the norm. “The things you see on Instagram, such as pastel-coloured houses and walls, seem to be becoming more visible in cities and suburbs. Instagram selfie-wall opportunities are cropping up everywhere, even at events. This is now the norm, so it makes sense for architects to plan them in. What will happen is that all our communal areas will take on a new look and feel to match the Insta need, but, in reality, this is what a trend is: something popular that works into our spaces and life. In 10 years, it will be something else.”London is not alone when it comes to installations that pander to our need for visual entertainment on our streets. In statistics released by Instagram for 2017, New York was the most photographed city, followed by Moscow and London. But, perhaps more than anywhere else, Los Angeles has realised and harnessed the power of social media when it comes to design. A city nestled below the famous Hollywood sign, it should not be much of a surprise that the demands of the lens are important to residents. Alexandra Lange, the architecture critic for the interiors site Curbed, points out that it it is home to one of the first cafes to catch on to social media. “Intelligentsia’s Silver Lake Coffeebar (designed by Bestor Architecure) is one of the first examples – everyone took a “shoe-fie” on its tile floor.” A search on social media shows the venue is a riot of colour, where the deep blue tiles command the most attention the cafe now has 20,000 tagged photos by customers on Instagram.Amelia Perrin, a writer and Instagrammer with more than 10,000 followers, is keen to visit places that will provide her with a good photo. Some restaurants, such as the Dirty Bones chain, offer a “kit” to help you get the best shot. “I’m definitely swayed to go somewhere by amazing looking food, but places that make amazing-looking food know it will be captured, and tend to make the interiors match the food in terms of ’gramability, which makes sense when social media is a sort of currency nowadays.” While Perrin says she wouldn’t go to places just for nice decor, she believes venues know that food and decor “definitely go hand in hand” in importance. “I’m more than happy to go to a crappy-looking cafe if I’m told the food is incredible, but who wouldn’t want to sit in beautiful surroundings instead?”Perrin admits that she is swayed by venues that look great in photos. “I wanted to go to a beautiful cafe for my birthday afternoon tea, so we went to Mad Dogs and Englishmen because I’d heard the interiors were stunning. They do rotating afternoon tea themes and I didn’t even bother to check the menu or what we would be eating because I was so excited about how the interiors looked, whereas usually I meticulously check menus. The food was amazing in the end, but I definitely chose to go there based on photos I’d seen of the decor.”Stefani Ellenbecker, the executive director at lifestyle blog Wit \u0026amp Delight, echoes the need to keep design functional and evergreen in the face of huge social media trends. “For us, it is more about what feels best or looks the most cohesive rather than always striving to stay ‘on trend’. Because we are increasingly viewing life through our phone lens, I think our lives, in a way, are becoming distorted. In our designs, we always try to encourage ‘functionality’ first and foremost.”It is not just venues and neighbourhoods that are adapting their spaces for the smartphone generation. Museums and public buildings now look to social media to raise visitor numbers. The Louvre is the most photographed museum on Instagram – unsurprising when critics have long bemoaned the daily scuffle to get a photo of the Mona Lisa. But the museum’s popularity has recently been boosted by Jay-Z and Beyonce’s decision to film the music video for Apeshit there. In response, organisers have introduced a 90-minute tour on which you can view the art featured in the video (and, naturally, take selfies to prove it).Other venues are hosting exhibitions that go bold on scale, colour and interactivity. Rain Room, an installation at the Barbican in 2012 that made you feel as if you were caught in a torrential downpour, has now travelled around the world and been documented by hordes of people. In Venice, sculptor Lorenzo Quinn’s giant pair of hands reaching out of the canal and stretching up a building became the photograph for tourists to get as they chugged by on a waterbus. It is unclear how many of them knew that the sculpture was intended to highlight climate change and the threat it poses to the island city.The art critic Waldemar Januszczak, in a review in the Times of the Frieze Sculpture exhibition (currently on show across Regent’s Park in London), praises the reinvention of public sculpture: “It used to be pious, repetitive, dull. Now it is inventive, varied, fun.” As you walk around the display, there are giant penguins, oversized Wendy houses and glass boxes alongside gleaming towers and even a gloomy un-inspirational quote: “Everything is lost.” But it is hard to ignore the number of people viewing the exhibits solely through their phones, using the art as a sidekick in a fun selfie, or perhaps just wanting others to know that they have imbibed some culture and not just spent time sunbathing.The best example of the power of the new breed of online photographer was perhaps the 2017 retrospective of the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama in Los Angeles. Tickets sold out within an hour. While Kusama’s paintings and objects were on show, the real draw were her “mirror rooms”. One visitor, in their quest to take a great image, damaged an installation and a 30-second time limit in each space was swiftly implemented. The popularity of these spaces, packed with kaleidoscopic lights and seemingly endless mirrors that enabled the perfect selfie, ignited a debate about whether the way we have consumed art has changed. Are we simply using it now to bolster our own image?According to Culture Track, a 2017 report by a marketing firm that tracked more than 4,000 cultural consumers in the US, respondents said they would rather have fun than be educated by cultural offerings, and preferred experiencing new things to learning something new at exhibitions. The study also found that the majority of responders wanted digital experiences in all cultural activities.Perhaps those surveyed should consider the US Museum of Ice Cream. Far removed from the educational school trips of your childhood, here you can jump into a pool of sprinkles, gambol in a field of gummy bears and, most importantly, document the whole experience. The venture has become a digital phenomenon, with more than 160,000 tagged posts on Instagram. Photos show giant sweets, unicorns, happy people on pink swings and others posing in the mocked-up supermarket.Alexandra Lange points out that new attractions, such as this or the Colour Factory, another travelling exhibition, seem to have been designed almost entirely for the crowd with cameras. “What looks good in a photo is a very shallow, static backdrop with a bright colour or scintillating pattern. But that has very little to do with comfort or flow or dwell time, which require depth and choreography and, usually, places where the eye is more attracted to the people you are with than to the decor.”Attractions such as Dreamland in Margate have even created a whole day out designed for you to snap away – signs that used to say “no photographs” increasingly now plead with you to “please take photos!” and add their hashtag for good measure.What does this all mean for innovation in design? The more we rely on our smartphones, the more our ability to concentrate seems to dwindle, so the shops and spaces we visit are forced to work harder to offer us new ways to experience life through our gadgets. We shouldn’t be surprised if the places we frequent begin to blur into each other. As Lange says: “Designing from Instagram for Instagram seems like a snake eating its own tail. Everywhere looks like everywhere else and the eye grows tired of bananas or concrete tiles or mirror rooms.”So many of us seem to view our surroundings only as a backdrop to our personal portfolio. But this comes at a cost. In the myth, when Narcissus looked down into that wonderful pond, it wasn’t the beauty of nature he admired: all he saw was his own reflection. Now it seems we are all content to dismiss the beauty around us in favour of fiddling with filters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/977af6d63d0acfb7aca97cee753703f74e973937/0_0_5907_3545/master/5907.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7a6b174b7184a6f8babc4e7505caa19","title":"quiz what kind of a sharer are you","story":"From crisps to feelings, sharing feels good.

Sky’s independent committee recommended that shareholders accept Comcast’s offer – having earlier in the day told them to accept Murdoch’s bid.The speed of Comcast’s reaction was a deliberate move designed to show Murdoch that the company is determined to pursue Sky and has the stomach for a bidding war. “The speed with which Comcast has responded to Fox’s bid speaks volumes about the determination of Comcast, led by Brian Roberts, to win the day,” Ian Forrest, an investment research analyst at the Share Centre, said. “It is perhaps no surprise that the market seems confident that the battle has further to go as the share price is now at 1520p, well above the latest Comcast offer.”Analysts at Jefferies believe it will take a bid of £16 a share or greater – more than £28bn – to succeed in a takeover of Sky.Last month, Disney upped its offer for Fox to $71.3bn ($38 a share). Earlier in the month, Comcast had trumped Disney’s first offer for Fox ($55.4bn $28 a share) with a $65bn, or $35 a share, bid.Fox shareholders are due to vote on Disney’s offer on 27 July, unless Comcast ups its bid again as rumoured.Under the terms of the proposed deal, Murdoch needs consent from Disney to increase his offer for Sky. Analysts believe that Disney, which has called Sky the “crown jewel” of the Fox assets, is up for the fight.“While it is certainly possible that Fox (and in turn, Disney) is going to walk away from Sky and not matchexceed Comcast’s offer, it does feel hard to believe,” Richard Greenfield, of the US research firm BTIG, said. “It is just hard to imagine Disney not going for the knockout one-two punch and taking everything. We continue to believe that if Comcast really wants to own Sky, their best way to do it is by acquiring the Fox assets – winner takes all was always the scenario that appeared most likely to us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d87a449d4b2537bcc243dd917f8606bbf0f3d4fc/42_16_3145_1888/master/3145.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=721c27be1c1a566d27b5bf89ceef1d31","title":"russia 2018 world cup england guardian support","story":"Our senior sports writer Barney Ronay explains how you can help keep the ’s football coverage in playHere we are then.

This is the best bit of covering sport. I’ve been going to tournaments for the  since 2008, and looking back I’m still amazed at the sheer amount of hard work and the sheer volume of content produced around these occasions. From minute-by-minute commentary sent directly to you from the vast pulsing brain of some insomniac footballing obsessive powered only by nicotine, chocolate and a haystack of empty energy drink cans. To on-the-scene reports and news from a band of reporters who write and travel and file and follow stories every day, returning to their families five weeks later hunched, unrecognisable figures unable to communicate on any subject beyond wifi quality, mixed zone ticket allocations and how to get to Salvador protea at 3am with a fair-to-decent chance of not being abducted. At the end of which comes the daily web presence and the pristine design and set of the paper itself. All of this arrives with you updated to the second, cobbled together from the corners of some sock-stinking press room, polished by endlessly patient whip-smart subs and made to look lovely by some sleep-deprived awkward genius of a layout designer. It’s no secret our industry is looking to find ways of continuing to do all this. The old way of selling bits of paper doesn’t seem to work. Advertising is a capricious business. Asking our readers to become subscribers, or to contribute to pay for something they value is, in our opinion, the best way forward.

If the Brooklyn-formed group were juice, it would be cold-pressed if they were an apartment, it would be a converted warehouse full of rare cacti and if their rather torrid saga became a movie, it would be directed by Noah Baumbach. They have the – potentially annoying – hyper-literacy of the economically comfortable middle-class hipster, both lyrically and in their erse influences (African pop, classical minimalism, R\u0026ampB, punk). They also have a propensity for moments of bow-legged wackiness a restive Dr Seuss energy makes them scurry about from one thing to the next, often within the same song, which you might need to acquire a taste for.You might have also been rubbed up the wrong way by their previous, self-titled record, one of the most extraordinary breakup albums ever released, which bandleader Dave Longstreth used to rake over his relationship with former bandmate Amber Coffman in forensic detail. Moments of exquisite poignancy (“we had our own little bubble” – a sad, perfect pause – “for a while”) were offset with hugely unlikable snootiness (“what I want from art is truth  what you want is fame”) and the sense that Coffman, once so much a part of the band, couldn’t put forward her side of the story.But even if you’re Coffman’s hipster-hating older brother, you might find a grin creeping across your face on hearing this irrepressible, sunny, even rather silly follow-up. If its predecessor was Longstreth’s Here, My Dear, this is his I Want You, the one where he es into the shallow waters of new love with his eyes closed. “You pulled me up when you took my hand,” he sings on the beautiful opener Right Now, aided by R\u0026ampB singer Syd on backing vocals. “There was silence in my heart and now I’m striking up the band.” They reply in bawdy honks of brass.On the next track, the single Break-Thru, Longstreth is like the friend you see on Saturday morning who has visibly got laid on Friday night: seemingly hoisted on air by cherubs and chirruping birds. This being Longstreth, though, his girl isn’t “fit” or “banging” – instead “she’s got features on Fellini  Deadpan, unimpressed, Archimedes’ palimpsest  Just hanging out all Julian Casablancas.” And off he bowls down the street, twanging a guitar line as happy and saucy as a wolf whistle. Later songs are called I Feel Energy, I Found It in U, You’re the One … “OK, we get it!” his brunch buddies must be crying out.This lovedrunk headspace prompts some funny, psychedelic images – “I’m in love for the first time ever  The universe becomes my mom and my dad,” he sings on I Found It in U. “And when we met there were alien hosannas  Thrown from the heavens like Prince and Nirvana.” While his musical speciality is knotty cleverness, the sheer certainty of his adoration also results in some of his simplest melodies, not least the chorus of Blue Bird, which feels like a nursery rhyme that you’ve always known. That’s not to say anything is smoothed out: Longstreth eggs his arrangements until they’re rich but still fluffy. Haim, Amber Mark, Empress of, Dear Nora, Rostam Batmanglij and Fleet Foxes’ Robin Pecknold also turn up for vocals, while there’s modular synth from Tyondai Braxton and dinky funk percussion high, plinking piano drives the waltz of What is the Time. Most idiosyncratic of all is the brilliant closing ballad (I Wanna) Feel It All, with Sinatra-style strings, reversed cymbals, and a two-note motif played on recorder – the latter instrument is a cool balm after the sweaty energy of the previous songs.It’s all very strongly written, though Longstreth is now reaching for familiar motifs – the lovely, downward-plodding chords of That’s a Lifestyle are reminiscent of those on the previous album’s equally lovely Up in Hudson, and there’s only so many more tightly circular riffs and sudden heavy guitar chords he can write. That’s a Lifestyle is nevertheless the richest track here, as Longstreth rolls his tongue back in long enough to muse on marketing and capital – though, given he rarely looks beyond himself, it could be an extended metaphor for his own band. How long Longstreth’s swoon will last is debatable, and you can imagine an awkward moment when his new partner dips into the previous album: “What’s this bit about ‘love’s gonna rot, and love’s gonna dissipate’?” But it’s thrilling to be caught in his heart’s upswing – a reminder that, like childbirth, we’ve evolved to forget the pain of heartbreak so we can keep moving forward."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f22f3a21ef78f95900c49b0d8166dac440dea2b6/352_114_3080_1849/master/3080.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b32584d1c77c322d2f59954a19386155","title":"justin bieber manager scooter braun ariana grande kanye west","story":"He helped Bieber find God and Ariana Grande respond to the Manchester Arena attack, while having to keep tabs on Kanye West. Scooter Braun explains why managing pop stars is perfect training for politicsPerfectly on time, Scooter Braun strides into a small, windowless room at Cannes’ Midem convention, the annual gathering of the world’s music business. For someone who has just flown in from the US, he looks remarkably good: suit and shirt perfect, no hint of jet lag. But these are good times, even by Braun’s standards. The man who once sold fake IDs at university could now reasonably claim to be the biggest manager in pop, with a personal fortune estimated at $23m (£17m), thanks to his involvement with the likes of Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber and Carly Rae Jepsen, as well as canny investments in Spotify, Uber and Dropbox. He has just announced the first film to come out of his studio, Mythos – an animated movie called Cupid, with Justin Bieber voicing the title character – and the founding of a reality TV company, GoodStory Entertainment.His relationship with his most wayward artist, Kanye West, is back on, after a “rough” couple of weeks in which West fired him, apparently enraged at Braun’s refusal to get rid of all his other clients and work solely with him. West announced that he couldn’t be managed (Braun favourited the tweet) in a media rampage that also included doubling down on his support for Donald Trump and appearing on TMZ to suggest that slavery was “a choice”. A “manic moment”, suggests Braun, brought on by the rapper’s bipolar disorder.Then there was the saga of Bieber’s 2013-14 fall from grace, a classic teen-idol-gone-wild scenario involving rumours of problems with alcohol and prescription drugs and a string of arrests for vandalism, driving offences and assault. It should have been the stuff of career-ending disaster. Instead, here Bieber is, clean, sober and a bigger star than ever, thanks not just to the exceptionally well-made 2015 album, Purpose, but also to a public rehabilitation that Braun says he began planning the moment Bieber “looked me in the eye and said: ‘I’m making a change.’”Braun won’t be drawn on what went wrong in the first place, other than to say that he thought Bieber might die. “I was not going to give up on him, I was not going to let him die, I was not going to put him in that position of: ‘Oh, let’s just keep him working.’”He says he isn’t worried that Bieber’s recent born-again Christianity may affect his popularity. Bieber was baptised – in the bathtub of a New York Knicks player, no less – by Carl Lentz, a pastor from Hillsong, a Pentecostal “megachurch” that has attracted criticism for its views on homosexuality. “At the end of the day, I would choose this result over what I was dealing with, a thousand times over,” says Braun. He thinks for a moment. “The best thing that happened to Justin Bieber is that he found God. He was able to remove himself from being worshipped, and realise he’s in service to others. Because I don’t think human beings are built to be worshipped.”Throughout it all, Braun has maintained a remarkably high profile for a pop manager. If he is scrupulously deferential to his clients in interviews – insisting it is Bieber who deserves credit for turning his own fortunes around, and that Braun only gave a speech from the stage at One Love Manchester because Grande didn’t want to do it herself – he is nevertheless very visible. He has more than 4 million Twitter followers tuning into a stream of plugs for his artists, photos of his family and self-help homilies. Rather than denying that he seeks the limelight, he says it was part of the plan from the start, devised when he was still a student.A well-raised Jewish boy from a nice part of Connecticut, he faced down antisemitism at school – someone carved a swastika into his car when he was elected class president – and went to study in Atlanta, promoting hip-hop parties as a sideline. One year, he says, Puff Daddy co-hosted a party with the manager of Outkast, then the world’s biggest hip-hop act. The next year, Outkast had split, their manager was no longer their manager, and Puffy was hosting a party without him. It was a cautionary tale never to make Braun’s success dependent on someone else, although he knew that building his own brand would be isive. He never aspired to be a manager, he says, and, at 37, admits that he will be annoyed if he’s still at it in his 50s. “I love working with the people I work with,” he says. “I’m blessed to be a part of these people’s stories. But their story is not just going to define mine.”There are frequent suggestions that he might enter politics. Last year, it was reported that the Democrats had approached him about running for governor of California. He was, he says, “getting pressured to do so at certain points”, but thinks he would be better off “doing good work in the private sector”. As well as One Love Manchester, he worked behind the scenes helping to organise the post-Parkland shooting March for Our Lives. “I think I still have unfinished business on the business side of my life,” he says. “If I were to go into a public-office position, I would want to remove myself completely from the business world.”He would be very convincing on television. When you ask him a question, he thinks for a moment, then the answer emerges, perfectly articulated, without an “um” or an “er” to be heard. He doesn’t appear to be much plagued by self-doubt, although he does keep bringing up the fact that he is nearly 38 as though looming middle age might blunt his self-proclaimed ability to identify a gap in the market and find an artist to fill it. “Am I going to tell you what I think the gaps in the market are today?” he asks, incredulous, when I mention it. “No, because I don’t want competition.”He has, it is true, repeatedly turned out to be absolutely right when everyone else suggested he was wrong. He graduated from promoting parties to working for Jermaine Dupri’s So So Def label, but left after a few years because, in part, he says, no one would listen to him telling them that social media was the future. “People thought I was crazy,” he nods. “I had ideas of using YouTube to break an artist by making video content, and everyone said: ‘You can’t take an artist off YouTube and make them into a star – this lo-fi content is not how you break an artist.’ When I first started saying artists should tweet at fans and follow fans on Twitter, people were like: ‘Why would you do that?’”He claims that the moment he clapped eyes on Bieber – on YouTube – he knew exactly how to make him the biggest star in the world. “I don’t even think it came from me. I’m a person who believes in God,” says Braun. But no one else believed him. “I took Justin from 60,000 views to 66m. An independent artist who was No 2 on YouTube in the world: no one would sign him. No one.”He says that “doubt and disrespect” drive him. Certainly, he seems to have a photographic memory for everyone who has ever slighted him, from a kid at school who disrespected his father to a basketball coach who is now in jail from Piers Morgan (who accused Grande of “running away” when she returned to Florida after the Manchester bombing) to rock manager Peter Mensch, who announced that Bieber’s drink-and drug travails didn’t matter because “no one’s going to remember his name in three years anyway”. “And that was four years ago,” he says, in dish-best-served-cold style. “Or five, I believe, at this point.”He has to go to another interview, this time on stage: he is Midem’s big star booking, the first recipient of its hall of fame award. The audience greets him like a conquering hero. He tells them that “anyone who says they make their own luck is an asshole” and that Kanye West “doesn’t have a malicious bone in his body”. He had told me exactly the same thing earlier: what a great guy he is in person, how much he cares about people, how those who make fun of him are mocking someone dealing with mental health issues. “There are things he has said that I vehemently disagree with. Do I let him off the hook? No, I have conversations and I try to push the points of where I am, and I wish the world could get to hear what he’s saying in those private conversations because I think it would explain a lot and also clarify what he really meant. But, y’know,” he shrugs, “he’s Kanye.”Wouldn’t your best advice be for him to just keep off social media? There’s a pause and, for once, an “um”. “Yeah. I mean, look, if you’re in a good place, yeah, go on social media.” And then, like the politician he may become, Braun neatly changes the subject. “But I’d also say I’m more concerned with the president of the United States being on social media than I am with Kanye West.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71a47073c92cef198f93768fa28f82c2e35cbe77/365_271_1328_797/master/1328.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8162f3487e2cf226048f3cc8a52810e9","title":"leonard bernstein composer conductor inspiration genius proms","story":"Composer, conductor, inspiration, FBI suspect … Leonard Bernstein was born 100 years ago this August, and this summer’s Proms will celebrate his work. Musicians, critics and his own family remember an astounding talentBernstein was impossibly brilliant in so many different areas: a genius conductor, composer, author, pianist, thinker, activist, educator and entertainer. But for me, his genius was in connecting the dots between all of these. Everything he read and experienced influenced everything he thought and did. I think he once said that he didn’t know whether he loved music or people more.He had passion, enthusiasm and intense and boundless curiosity about our world. Bernstein did not think about education and music as being separate entities for him, they were part of a systemic, organic, whole-person educational approach. He was at the forefront of interdisciplinary learning - both a radical new concept and a harkening back to the Greeks. Education as a whole was important to him: information as food, nutrition, a source of power and, most importantly, possibility.When I was growing up in New York, Bernstein was an integral part of the city’s life. I remember seeing him on TV on Sunday afternoons and going to hear New York Philharmonic Young People’s concerts. After one of these, when I was about nine, I said to my parents: “I want to be a conductor.” Bernstein was the consummate amalgam of high-brow, low-brow and every other brow. He ascribed to Duke Ellington’s view: there are two kinds of music, good and bad. West Side Story is one of the most skilfully written musical pieces of all time. He remains the benchmark for outreach and engagement.Marin Alsop conducts the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra in Bernstein’s Slava! (A political overture) and his second symphony at the Proms on 27 August.I first met Bernstein in 1971. I became his assistant, then editor, and I conducted many of his works. The first thing he told me, as we sat down for a sandwich, was that he believed that every masterpiece was built on a single tempo, and all the speeds of the music through the entire work are related to that central spine. He was a very physical conductor. He would leave the ground on the upbeat - his style was not to everyone’s taste. “I’ve yet to have anyone demonstrate,” said Pierre Monteux, “that an orchestra plays louder because you jump higher.” His was certainly a unique way of expressing music, historically closer to how Beethoven or Berlioz were described as conducting. He told me he hated the way he looked when he conducted, adding “but when I do it I get the sound I want.”For him, Beethoven was the greatest composer of all time - his very first TV show was on Beethoven’s 5th symphony. Beethoven never lets you down, he said, because everything he wrote sounds inevitable. He was uncomfortable conducting Wagner: as a Jewish man, he found it difficult to separate his music from his anti-semitic writings and way it was used by the Nazis. He loved the wit and balance of Haydn, though, and was particularly celebrated for his interpretations of Mahler, a composer very close to his heart. If Lenny’s performances were a collaboration between his live audience and his live musicians, when he recorded he became Lenny the rabbi - the docent who wanted to illuminate the ancient texts. All conductors are storytellers and Lenny was one of the best. He’d come out onto the stage, bow, shake hands with the orchestra’s leader, and wait, wait for the audience to be paying attention. One of the things I miss most about him is his ability to tell a joke, because of his timing. Timing is everything in classical music.John Maucieri is the author of Maestros and their Music: the Art and Alchemy of Conducting.From his early childhood until his death Bernstein was unwavering in his support for liberal causes. He was politically active all his life. As a studentin the 1930s, he directed a production of The Cradle Will Rock, Marc Blitzstein’s opera about corruption and corporate greed. The local police reported him to the FBI, whose file on the young musician grew over the subsequent 15 years as the McCarthy era approached. Not only was Bernstein subject to FBI spying for his support for wartime Russian relief, and postwar support for refugees from fascism, but also from support for civil rights for African Americans.In 1949, Bernstein was labelled a communist and blacklisted, his music banned by the CBS network and from the movies. Only in 1953, when he signed an 11-page affidavit saying he was not a communist, was he allowed his passport back. and removed from the blacklist, hired by Warner Bros to compose the music for the film On the Waterfront, and appeared on CBS. By 1957, as music director of the New York Philharmonic, he was fully rehabilitated. Under President Kennedy, a personal friend,Bernstein was emboldened to speak publicly on behalf of the civil rights movement. He was part of the Stars for Freedom rally, a concert organised by Harry Belafonte to inspire the 25,000 marching from Selma to Montgomery to demand voting rights. He marched against the Vietnam war, but when, in 1970, he hosted a party to raise funds for Black Panther associates charged with criminal activity, and, moreover, supported the anti-war activist Daniel Berrigan, he found himself on the wrong side of not just the FBI but most of the liberal media. Luckily for Bernstein, Watergate destroyed Nixon, and Hoover died, before they could destroy the conductor’s career.Barry Seldes is the author of Leonard Bernstein: The Political Life of an American Musician (University of California Press, 2009)For a decade from 1954 he delivered televised essays intended for grown-ups. Beethoven’s sketchbooks, the development of American musical comedy, what makes opera grand? Such subjects were grist to his mill: he was a born communicator and he had stimulating, jargon-free things to say about a broad range of musical subjects. When music director of the New York Philharmonic (in 1958, the first American in that post) he insisted on a clause ensuring four televised Young People’s Concerts each season. With only three TV channels on the air, those YPCs could pull in a prime-time audience of 30 million. He certainly changed my life – I hope for the better – and I count the writing of his biography, along with the creation of Young Musician of the Year, as the most useful things I have done with my four score years and seven.Humphrey Burton’s biography of Leonard Bernstein (1994) was recently republished by Faber with a new introduction.He was an incredibly attentive and affectionate father. Of course there were many prolonged absences when he was travelling, and sometimes I found it frustrating to share him with the rest of the world, but when he was at home he was always really present. We’d have big dinners and play word games and have proper family time, my parents, my younger brother and sister and I. He loved to share anything he was excited about, and that was everything from Lewis Carroll to Gilbert and Sullivan to vaudeville routines he remembered from his childhood. It was like he was two different people trapped in one body. There was the gregarious side who was always the last one standing at the party – that was the conductor and teacher in him but then there was the composer side – and to compose you need solitude. Composing was always a tortuous process. He hated being alone, but he had to do it. He thought of himself primarily as a composer and I think he’d have been particularly thrilled to find how his music is being performed and celebrated around the world in this centenary year. And it sounds better than ever - as fresh as a daisy. During his lifetime a “serious” composer was supposed to write 12-tone music - but because he kept writing those pesky melodies he was never embraced by academia and recognised as the great composer that he was. He’d have liked to have been celebrated more for his music during his lifetime but it wasn’t to be - it used to sometimes make him mad, but never for long. He accepted how things were, and he spent his life trying to make the world a better place. He wanted to use his music to say what was true, to raise consciousness and be an advocate for peace. Today’s young musicians are so different from their predecessors – there is no longer the premium on their being in the ivory tower, and they’re so much more involved in the world about them. They’re called citizen artists – an expression I love, and I think my father was Citizen Artist No 1.Jamie Bernstein is the author of Famous Father Girl: A Memoir of Growing Up Bernstein.When I was young we would play cassettes of musical theatre in the car. I had two favourite songs I would play again and again: New York, New York (from On the Town) and West Side Story’s Dance at the Gym. It was only years later that I came to realise that they were both in fact written by the same person! Like so many people, the first Bernstein work I got to know well was West Side Story. I was thrilled by its combination of emotional expression through the music and the choreographic genius of Jerome Robbins. There can have been no better example of pure collaboration, of both art forms truly inhabiting the other. Bernstein’s music theatre always tells you a story. He doesn’t ever give you a toe-tapping tune just because the audience expect one at that point. He created fully formed emotional intelligent worlds in which his characters can truly live. It’s still today rare that the danced elements of shows take on any meaningful narrative responsibility. Bernstein and Robbins created huge moving dance sequences that, along with the almost operatic vocal requirements, put total confidence in each of the respective disciplines and say: “Go on ... you can do it ... we believe in you.” His work certainly requires a level of discipline of its performers that is off the chart. I directed and choreographed On the Town for Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre last summer. It was terrifying to approach technically, but so thrilling to dance even if he’s cruel to choreographers’ brains! Before we started rehearsals I worried it was going to be challenging to get an entire company to hear and feel the music in the same way, but the music is so startlingly instinctual it was not a problem. Bernstein has that thing – in bucketloads – that makes a dancer’s spine tingle. The key to directing his work is simply to listen the inspiration that the music gives you. He believed that music theatre can be art of the very highest form. If we all led with our hearts rather than our minds and our concerns about what others might think, we might all get a little closer to his brilliance.Drew McOnie is currently directing and choreographing Baz Luhrmann’s Strictly Ballroom in the West End, and King Kong on Broadway.I wanted to celebrate Bernstein’s centenary differently and decided on the symphonies as a cycle, works I hugely admire. I’ve recorded all three with the Orchestra of the Academy of Santa Cecilia, and bring one to the proms. Bernstein loved the colour and warmth of the orchestra. His compositions were maligned by many of his contemporaries – he didn’t fit into the music of Darmstadt, of Boulez, of the avant garde – but Lenny did more for American new music than all the rest put together. Bernstein describes his symphonies as a crisis of faith, but always looking for redemption, for renewing that faith. Look what God throws down at us - it’s tough to be Jewish, tough to be Christian, tough to be religious - is the overriding theme of the cycle. His first symphony, Jeremiah, was written in 1942 - a time when the world was in a very dark place. His third and final symphony, Kaddish (1963, rev 1977) is a response to the assassination of JF Kennedy, the text of its narration written by Bernstein himself and conceived for his wife.I watched him conduct Copland’s Third Symphony with the youth orchestra in Tanglewood. His relationship with the older composer was close, and it was a very important piece for him, the work was somehow so inside him that he copied shamelessly from it. Many gestures, in Bernstein’s first symphony and also at the end of his second ‘the Age of Anxiety’, come from that Copland symphony. The falling fourths, certainly, but you can hear them in Mahler’s Symphony No 1 too, another composer who influenced Bernstein profoundly.Bernstein’s reputation as a conductor has, for some, overwhelmed his identity as a composer. He probably remained bitter about that, but he’s one of those composers where you can take every bar of his music and reference it back to something else and yet, like other great composers, you play three notes and you know it’s Bernstein.Antonio Pappano conducts the Orchestra of the Academy of Santa Cecilia in Bernstein’s first symphony at the Proms on 10 August. Pappano’s Bernstein: The 3 Symphonies is out on 10 August on Warner Classics.I don’t think I fully appreciated the true genius of Bernstein until I came to learn the Candide score. Cunegonde is easily the favourite character I’ve ever played. She starts out as a tragic victim and then there’s this delicious flip, and things get simply hysterical. Her most famous aria, Glitter and Be Gay, her embrace of all things sparkly and glittery, is the very height of her madness, reflected in the music – which goes up a high E-flat. It’s incredibly difficult to sing, you need to be completely accurate, but also make it sound effortless.But it’s all there in the music - all a singer needs is to get out of the way and deliver what Bernstein wrote in the score and the character comes to life. It’s all done for you in the writing. For me, Bernstein’s genius is like Shakespeare or Sondheim’s – every single note or word is intentional for the character. He understood singers completely, and asks all his musicians to push themselves to ridiculous limits, but it always feels so natural. It’s almost like it happens without you even knowing it. I think of it as using your voice to dance with the music. I love to watch footage of Bernstein conducting. He’s dancing about and having such fun.Scarlett Strallen performs with John Wilson and the Oslo Philharmonic in the Best of Bernstein gala concert on 22 and 23 November 2018 at Oslo Konserthus.Bernstein’s musical reputation seems more elevated today than it was in the years immediately following his death. As the works emerge from the huge shadow of his personality, they show their quirky virtues: the command of multiple musical languages, the daring juxtapositions of genre and style, the political outspokenness, and, of course, the sheer fluency of invention. Mass, in particular, is in the ascendant: whatever one might think of it, the conceit is extraordinarily original, even avant-garde. A Quiet Place is also slowly making its way. I wasn’t entirely convinced when I saw the New York City Opera stage the work in 2010, but the new DG recording of a reduced chamber version, with Kent Nagano conducting, makes a strong case for the piece as a raw, honest, almost seismographic record of the fractures at the heart of the American dream. Bernstein’s candour, his inability to say anything other than what he really meant, is what we miss most today. One can only imagine what yawps of rage the spectacle of Donald Trump would have elicited from him. The outward-looking, all-embracing America that Bernstein knew, loved and embodied seems very far away.Alex Ross is the New Yorker’s music critic and the author of The Rest is Noise and Listen to This."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4af2226b28f06859b21ed031309c85a96bca2905/0_0_2048_1228/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d47dc34e8e7a4e75c17d5a08cd7bae08","title":"simon le bon duran duran shereen hariri","story":"Duran Duran singer says the claim that he groped Shereen Hariri during a public appearance in Los Angeles is ‘simply untrue’Simon Le Bon has denied sexually assaulting a fan in 1995. Shereen Hariri alleged that the Duran Duran singer groped her while signing autographs at the Los Angeles record store where she worked. She accused Le Bon of grabbing and “massaging” her “right butt cheek” and “making his way down my butt to my genitals”.Le Bon has denied Hariri’s claims in a post on Duran Duran’s official Facebook page. “The behaviour that Ms Hariri has accused me of would have been just as inappropriate and unacceptable to me then as it is today. But the allegation is simply untrue. When Ms Hariri first contacted me about her claim months ago, I proposed meeting with her in person so I could set the record straight. Instead, she has decided to pursue this publicly. I have always been one who can admit to my mistakes and apologise for my failings. But I cannot apologise for something I did not do.”Hariri’s lawyer told the Detroit Free Press that Le Bon had pulled out of a proposed meeting with Hariri, which prompted her going public. “We were within a hair’s breadth to do a sit-down with him,” said Sarah Prescott. “At first he was kind of, ‘Yes, well, maybe later.’ It was just not gonna happen. Her view was, ‘Let’s just let the sunlight in.’”Hariri, 47, said that the incident left her “shocked and completely frozen”. She was “afraid of the consequences” of confronting the singer. “If I made a scene, I’d be in the press: The ‘Girl Who Accused Simon Le Bon’. I’d probably be fired, rejected, ignored, even hated.”The release of the Access Hollywood tape in which Donald Trump bragged about using his fame to assault women spurred Hariri to change her mind. “I decided that time’s up. I’m not holding this secret any more. I want everyone to know what this man did to me. I hope he comes clean publicly. I hope he make amends to his wife and daughters.” She clarified that she was not seeking compensation – the US statute of limitations for assault is two years – but an apology. Le Bon’s assistant, Katy Krassner, said she was at the record store event and supported Le Bon’s denial in a comment posted beneath his statement. “I can tell you that what he is being accused of DID NOT happen. Simon was never out of my sight that entire day, as each of the people on the Duran Duran team were ‘assigned’ to a band member to help with the record signing. Apart from anything else, as any fan knows, these kinds of events are a whirlwind of quick handshakes and photo calls which literally last a matter of seconds. The idea that he sat there, right next to his band mates, in front of a bunch of cameras, reaching behind him to sexually assault someone that day is simply ludicrous.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a5132f699a17a1bcddcd51984b6e631e4f0c6bd/36_487_4776_2865/master/4776.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8b6a9b87c04353def64f2e96cdfa9e3","title":"nevis how the worlds most secretive offshore haven refuses to clean up","story":"The years since 2008 have seen a global crackdown on offshore finance. Yet a few places have doubled down on offering secrecy to the super-rich. Among these, one tiny Caribbean island might be the worst offender. By  Oliver BulloughTax havens hate attention. Places such\u0026nbspas Jersey, Switzerland and the\u0026nbspBritish Virgin Islands made a handsome living from helping their clients break other countries’ laws for\u0026nbspdecades, without anyone really noticing. And\u0026nbspthey liked it that way. Then came the 2007-8 financial crisis, and the good times ended. Rich nations, angry over the loss to their budgets caused by tax dodging, put diplomatic pressure on the havens. Activists, furious over the theft of hundreds of billions of pounds from poor countries, exposed them in the press. The release of\u0026nbspvast troves of confidential information – SwissLeaks, the HSBC files, the Panama Papers, the Paradise Papers – cemented a public perception that offshore financial centres exist to help the powerful dodge their obligations to the rest of us, and governments have queued up to punish them. In May, when Britain’s parliament voted to\u0026nbspforce transparency on its Caribbean islands, it was just\u0026nbspthe latest blow to the offshore havens.Although cooperating with outsiders in this way has\u0026nbspproven expensive, the havens clearly concluded there was little choice. If\u0026nbspdenied access to the global financial system, or sanctioned by Brussels or Washington, an offshore centre could be put out of business altogether.This is good. Tax havens have helped the world’s wealthiest and most powerful keep a disproportionate share of the benefits of globalisation, by preventing the rest of us from seeing how much they own. This, in turn, has eroded trust in democracy and capitalism all over the world. Restricting the operations of tax havens, and\u0026nbspenforcing true transparency on the ownership of property, is crucial if citizens are truly to take back control of their countries’ destinies.Yet, at the heart of this increasingly encouraging picture, there remain a few holdouts – places that have stuck to the old habit of keeping the secrets of the powerful. Foremost among them is Nevis, a solitary volcano in the Caribbean with a\u0026nbsppopulation of just 11,000, which has been implicated in some of the most sordid financial scams of modern times, from Britain’s biggest-ever tax fraud to the fleecing of 620,000 vulnerable Americans in a $220m payday loan scam. The story of Nevis reveals the difficulties the world faces in trying to put an end to\u0026nbsptax\u0026nbspevasion, fraud and kleptocracy.While Nevis’s rivals have lost business by opening up,\u0026nbspNevis has doubled down on secrecy. Not long ago, I\u0026nbspspoke to a\u0026nbsplawyer with extensive experience of the island, who asked not to be identified because he still needs to work\u0026nbspwith Nevisian officials. “The only good thing that Donald Trump could do, if he was ever so inclined,” he said, “is take a battleship and roll it up to Nevis, and literally train the guns and say: ‘Get rid of these bullshit laws or I’ll blow you to kingdom come.’”In short, he said, “A bright light needs to be shone on\u0026nbspthis cockroach.”Tax havens are often lumped together as if they all do the same job. In reality, they are distinctive and highly specialised predators in the financial shark tank. At the top of the food chain – as far as the western world goes, anyway – are places such as London, Switzerland and New York. These apex predators are surrounded by clouds of\u0026nbsppilot fish that snap up the scraps: places such as Monaco, Jersey and the Cayman Islands.These smaller centres all play different aspects of the offshore game: Jersey specialises in trusts, the BVI in incorporation, Liechtenstein in foundations. They also differ in their tolerance for criminality. Among the British territories: Gibraltar is dodgier than Guernsey, but cleaner than Anguilla. And they serve different geographical regions: Mauritius for Africa and India Cyprus for the former Soviet Union the Bahamas for the US.In the world of offshore, Nevis is a bottom-feeder. It specialises in letting its clients create corporations with greater anonymity than almost anywhere else on earth. Last year, information on 70,000 Nevisian companies was leaked as part of the Paradise Papers investigation, but that didn’t help us find out who owns them: ownership information is so secret there that even the\u0026nbspisland’s own corporate registry doesn’t know. In other words, there was nothing substantial to leak.“We feel very strongly that people are entitled to some semblance of financial privacy,” the Nevis premier, Mark Brantley, himself an offshore lawyer, told me when we met in his office in January. “Why shouldn’t you be entitled to a secret?”The secrets don’t belong to residents of Nevis, of course: it would be hard to keep anything quiet for long on an island this size. The secrets belong to foreigners and are being kept from other foreigners, with Nevis getting paid to protect them.We can see that these secrets exist thanks to the UK’s Land Registry, which releases spreadsheets listing all offshore-owned property in the country, along with the registered address of the company that owns it. Some of\u0026nbspthe secrets are mundane and could be entirely innocent. For instance, who is behind Shi Li Gao Trustees Ltd, the Nevis-incorporated company that owns 13 Brunswick Gardens, a handsome terrace a short walk from Kensington Palace? Some of them are intriguing: for what reason would a Catholic primary school in Liverpool be held\u0026nbspvia\u0026nbspthis little Caribbean volcano? And some are decidedly weird: who on earth decided to structure their ownership of a room in a hotel on Llandudno’s North Parade through Caribbean Establishment LLC?But all of these questions are impossible to answer since the secrets are sealed away in Nevis. If these properties were owned via a British company, the true owner of that company would have to be declared to Companies House, and would be visible to anyone with access to the internet. If they were owned via a BVI company, that information would be available to the British police. But a Nevisian company is a closed book, and some people really like it that way.While the BVI has seen the number of companies created there each year collapse, the number created in Nevis has stayed stable. Since 2012, the island’s financial services sector has grown by more than a quarter, as people with secrets have moved to a place that still keeps them. That is a pretty good argument for Brantley’s government not to follow the BVI in opening up its corporate registries to foreigners. Secrecy pays.“The numbers are relatively small, compared to other financial services industries around, but bear in mind the size of Nevis,” Brantley said. “We get direct revenues of $5m-$5.5m, simply from renewal fees.” Renewal fees are what you pay to maintain your company’s registration the more companies there are, the more fees you get. “When that is extrapolated outwards – in terms of rental of office space, employment – we recognise that it does have a multiplier effect on the economy.”It is this provision of secrecy that makes Nevis such an\u0026nbspobstacle to law-enforcement investigators. If police can’t prove who owns something, they can’t prove it was criminally acquired, say, or that tax was avoided on the profits from it. This is what crooks are looking for when they send their business offshore. Around 300 British properties are owned in Nevis, and Brantley was unrepentant in defending the secrecy his island provides\u0026nbspto those properties’ owners.“Why should a bureaucrat in London, or wherever, curious about his neighbour’s financial situation, pick up\u0026nbspthe phone and say, ‘You know what, I need to know if\u0026nbspMr John Smith, who’s my neighbour down the road, has an account or a company in Nevis.’ Why’s that his business?” Brantley asked. “Why are Mr John Smith’s financial affairs any business of a bureaucrat in London, unless there’s an allegation against Mr John Smith that he’s somehow contravening some law somewhere?”It is an interesting philosophical question, but it is also a major problem. Countries recognise and respect each other’s laws and sovereignty, so Nevis corporations have as much international validity as anyone’s. So, as long as Nevis persists in denying foreigners access to the ownership information of its companies – no matter how hard other places work to open up – scoundrels can keep routing their business via Nevis, breaking the chain of traceable ownership, and hiding themselves and their crimes from discovery. That means crooked politicians, tax dodgers and fraudsters in Ukraine, Nigeria, Malaysia, the US or anywhere else get to mismanage their country’s finances for their own benefit.And, thanks to Nevis’s curious constitutional situation\u0026nbsp– it is neither an independent country nor can it\u0026nbspbe controlled by any other country – there doesn’t appear to be anything we can do about it.From the sea, Nevis (pronounced “knee-vis”) resembles a\u0026nbspgreen nipple. It is elegantly symmetrical, a tropical volcano ringed with golden beaches. By surface area, it is roughly the same size as Bristol, yet its peak is taller than any mountain in England, so the whole island slopes upwards, starting gently where the beach bars shelter among the palm trees, then steadily steepening, while the tree cover gets denser. If you hike up the peak,\u0026nbspyou are in true rainforest, and will find yourself scrutinised by monkeys in the overhanging greenery.It is a gorgeous place, much frequented by famous people. Earlier this week, John Cleese told Newsnight he\u0026nbspwas so fed up with how Britain is run that he is moving to Nevis for good. “It’s one of the nicest islands\u0026nbspI’ve ever been to,” he said. “The children and\u0026nbspadults are extraordinarily well-educated, the weather’s good the whole time, I’m very lucky.”The island was once a major centre for Britain’s sugar growers and slave traders, but it slipped into obscurity in\u0026nbspthe 18th century, when it was out-competed by larger and more fertile rivals. In the 19th century, Britain added it to neighbouring St Kitts for administrative purposes, and it was as the junior half of the Federation of St Kitts and Nevis that it became independent in 1983.The 80s were a bonanza period for Caribbean islands, as the global economy opened up and law enforcement was caught flat-footed. Tax evaders and drug dealers from North and South America flew planeloads of dollar bills into places such as Cayman and Anguilla, stashed them in bank accounts owned by untraceable shell companies, then invested them in property in Florida, the south of France or New York.In 1984, Bill Barnard, an American lawyer who had taken to vacationing on Nevis, asked the island’s premier if he would be interested in getting into the offshore game. Thanks to the almost complete autonomy Nevis enjoys under the federal constitution of St Kitts and Nevis, its first premier, Simeon Daniel, was free to do what he liked. He approved Barnard’s suggestion, passed the incorporation and secrecy laws the American lawyer drafted and awarded Barnard’s company, Morning Star Holdings, the right to act as exclusive agent for creating the companies. It was a\u0026nbspwin for both of them. (Neither Morning Star Holdings nor Barnard wished to comment for this piece.)At first, Nevis struggled to compete with already-established rivals, partly because it had no particular advantage of its own. Barnard and his team of American lawyers had borrowed their legislation from Delaware, which acts as a sort of tax haven within the US by offering laxer regulations and lower taxes than the other states, so there wasn’t much reason to look to a remote island for products you could already buy elsewhere. “It was certainly successful,” says David Neufeld, a New Jersey lawyer and an expert on company structuring and international tax. “But it was never at the level of BVI or Cayman.”When Barnard’s monopoly expired in 1994, Nevis took\u0026nbspthe opportunity to reboot. Neufeld already worked with Barnard, and was asked to help Nevis ersify its offering. Tax havens are always borrowing ideas from each other, seeking to improve on laws that are proving popular – and this process has led to progressively greater secrecy, fewer taxes and lighter regulations. Neufeld looked to the USnited States for inspiration, and specifically to Wyoming, which had invented the limited liability company (LLC), a useful hybrid structure that allowed people to avoid identification and taxes at the same time, as well as offering other benefits.LLCs make it hard for your creditors to find your assets, which also helps rich people avoid paying damages if they lose a lawsuit. Your creditors may have a court judgment against you, but if they can’t find your stuff, they will settle for perhaps 50 cents on the dollar to get the legal wrangling over with. Lawyers call this asset protection.But in the US, it is hard to hide property, since courts can order disclosure of information. Handily, those courts have no jurisdiction in Nevis, which made the idea of a Caribbean version of the LLC very attractive. “In my mind, I was trying to create an LLC for the 51st state,” Neufeld told me. “If you see yourself as someone who could be exposed to some kind of predatory lawsuit where people feel you have assets that are exposed, this\u0026nbspgives you an opportunity to protect that.”In simple terms, Nevis’s laws allow rich people to put ramparts around their property, to protect it from someone who might want to use the courts to take it away, whether that be a business partner, a spouse, an estranged child, or indeed anyone. All tax havens do this, but Nevis turned the ratchet many clicks further than its rivals, in\u0026nbspits efforts to tempt business away from its rivals.To bring legal proceedings on Nevis, you have to file a bond of $100,000 with the court as proof that your case isn’t frivolous. If you win, that is only the beginning of your quest for the assets. Nevis’s regulator holds no information on either the ownership of the company or\u0026nbspits assets. Nevis’s LLCs – Neufeld’s innovation – can’t be wound up, meaning you won’t be able to confiscate any assets they own, and\u0026nbspyou would have to seek redress elsewhere. If you seek to challenge the legality of a property being put in\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspNevis-registered trust – for example, if you thought the property actually belonged to you – you have to prove\u0026nbspbeyond reasonable doubt that the trust’s creation was fraudulent, and you would have to begin that legal challenge within a year of its creation. This is tricky, since\u0026nbspNevis law requires all information on the trust to\u0026nbspbe\u0026nbspconfidential, so you would be unlikely to know it\u0026nbspeven existed.These ludicrously formidable defences are not really intended to\u0026nbspbe used, but instead – like the bright colouring of a poisonous tree frog – they exist to warn you off attacking in the first place. If they can persuade a plaintiff to settle out of court for less than is owed, then, for a rich person with vulnerable assets, they are well worth paying for.“I don’t like the word ‘hidden’,” says Laurie Lawrence, who retired a couple of years ago after two decades as permanent secretary to the Nevis government. “It’s protected, not hidden. There’s nothing to hide. Look at it from the other way: a lot of females are gold-diggers. You are married to a man you don’t really love him, but he has money. People find ways and means to protect their assets.”This is perhaps why a wealthy person might want to own a Kensington house (or, indeed, a Llandudno hotel room) via a Nevisian company or other structure: it prevents a orced spouse, or any other creditor, from accessing that property, without a tortuous legal process. “Nevis structures started coming up about 12 years ago, and they’re coming around with increasing prevalence,” Jeffrey Fisher, one of America’s leading orce lawyers, told me by telephone from West Palm Beach in Florida.“I’m a former prosecutor, and I know about the ways people hide money, and what they’ll do,” said Fisher. “My approach to getting assets that are in asset protection entities like a Nevis LLC, is that you don’t go to Nevis and try to get the money out – that is a foolhardy enterprise. They passed laws and they set up structures to stop us and to make it expensive and to make it take years and years and years. What we do here is we use some more creative approaches to, for lack of a better term, make them cough up the dough.”Fisher’s approach is to target property and bank accounts in the US, to make his opponents’ lives so onerous that they eventually beg to settle – and he’s extremely good at it. The trouble is that anyone who cannot afford to employ highly expensive specialists such as Fisher has no prospect of even finding where their spouse has put their property, let alone wrestling a fair share away from them. They have to accept what they’re given – there’s no court that can help them.“You’ve got to realise that the asset protection industry is trillions of dollars, not billions of dollars, it’s trillions of dollars,” said Fisher. “Essentially, it’s: we’re going to find a way to screw legitimate creditors out of collecting a legitimate debt. That’s the business these people are in.”Brantley, the Nevis premier, is fluent and passionate in his defence of the ramparts that Nevis builds for rich people looking to protect their assets from creditors. “All it does is say that you’re creating a locked box, so to speak, if you want to protect assets,” Brantley said, when we met in his office up the hill from Charlestown, Nevis’s capital village. “And people protect assets for a variety of reasons. It’s not always to get away from a pending orce.”The trouble is that when you cast your eye beyond the orce cases, Nevis’s business model begins to looks even worse. The Nevis financial system is rudimentary compared to the large tax havens – places such as Jersey, or the Cayman Islands, which have major accountancy firms, fund managers, large banks and other global behemoths. In Nevis, there’s precious little money for anyone to avoid tax on. But then, it isn’t really a haven from taxes at all, so much as a haven from scrutiny of any kind. The same laws that appeal to the kind of nervous and wealthy men who want to hide their assets from their wives, have been regularly exploited by crooks from all over the world.Britain’s biggest-ever tax fraud – for which five men were jailed in November, after attempting to scam the Treasury out of £107m in tax – involved Nevis-registered companies, which were helping to hide the identity of\u0026nbspthe fraudsters. The family of a former president of Taiwan used a Nevis trust to help to hide its ownership of\u0026nbspcorruptly acquired US property. Ukraine’s deposed president, Viktor Yanukovych, used Nevis structures to\u0026nbsphide his stolen assets, as did corrupt Russian officials who stole $230m from the budget in 2007. (When the accountant Sergei Magnitsky uncovered the scam, they\u0026nbsparrested him and left him to die in jail.) British trader Navinder Sarao, who pleaded guilty to fraud for\u0026nbsphelping cause 2010’s flash crash, erted some of his\u0026nbspprofits to a Nevis structure called the NAV Sarao Milking Markets Fund.According to the independent advocacy group Tax Justice Network, Nevis out-obscures all the traditional offshore centres: BVI, Switzerland, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, Luxembourg, and even fellow bottom-feeders such as Belize and the Cook Islands. And its enthusiasm for secrets impedes other countries’ efforts to enforce transparency.But a search of the Companies House website reveals how Nevis is able to defang Britain’s attack on secrecy. For instance, I recently came across three LLPs, all of which are owned by the same two Nevis companies: Tallberg and Uniwell. According to data gathered by the\u0026nbspOrganised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, one of these LLPs controlled a Latvian bank account used\u0026nbspin a\u0026nbspmoney-laundering scheme the other two have\u0026nbspnot been implicated in any wrongdoing (and neither have Tallberg and Uniwell). According to Companies House, the three LLPs have the same ownership structure, which means that their person or persons with significant control should be the same. Mysteriously, however, each of the LLPs is listed as having a different PSC. Logically, this cannot be true. But we have no way of knowing who the real PSC is, since Nevis does not cooperate with the UK in allowing law enforcement officers to see who really owns Nevisian companies such\u0026nbspas Tallberg and Uniwell. These three LLPs are not isolated examples – Tallberg and Uniwell alone have owned dozens of British companies, and there are many\u0026nbspmore Nevisian corporations like them.The new UK law requiring disclosure of true owners is\u0026nbspuseless if that ownership can just be hidden in Nevis. And this is why Nevis-controlled but British-registered companies, whose ownership is unclear, have been involved in many of the massive eastern European money-laundering scams collectively known as the “laundromats”, which have moved tens of billions of dollars out of the former Soviet Union. Nevis ownership can transform a supposedly transparent British company into a secrecy vehicle as iniquitous as anything on earth.Charlestown is a handsome place, consisting of a long street of two-storey buildings parallel to the shore, many with first-floor balconies for catching the sea breeze. Its most striking feature, however, is the truly remarkable number of signs advertising lawyers, accountants and administrators. The Devon town of Ilfracombe, with its 11,000 inhabitants, has two lawyers’ offices, an insurance company and two sets of accountants, as well as a branch of Lloyds and a Nationwide. The 11,000 Nevisians, by contrast, host six domestic banks, one international bank, 18 insurance managers, seven international insurance entities, four money service businesses and 58 registered agents, many of them law firms. Nevis may\u0026nbspbe the most over-lawyered place on earth.When you get off the ferry, almost the first house you\u0026nbspsee is the Henville building, nominal home to the Azerbaijan first family’s business empire. If you then turn right at the T-junction, you see the Edith Solomon building (although it has lost two of the letters from its name), which hosted an Idaho payday loan company that was shut down by the state government in 2012, for operating without a license. Barely 100 metres in the opposite direction on Main Street, meanwhile, is the office of Morning Star Holdings, pioneers of the Nevis offshore industry.I was keen to find the registered address of Tallberg and Uniwell, the two Nevisian companies that had so successfully outmanoeuvred UK company law, in the – admittedly, rather forlorn – hope that I could find someone who would give me information about them. Their registered address was\u0026nbspthe same as that of the Nevis International Trust Company (NITC), which, according to its website, will supply you not only with a\u0026nbspshell company, but also with nominee directors and\u0026nbspshareholders, which will further obscure your involvement in it, as well as a bank account, a credit card and a stock trading account. “Nevis is an excellent location for: privacy, estate planning, asset protection, tax reduction planning, holding investments, royalty and licensing ownership,” the website states.I had an address for the NITC’s office, but no one on the island was able to tell me where it was. I spent a frustrating, hot and thirsty morning searching for it and, when I finally got through on the phone, was brushed off. “I’m not a robber,” I told the woman who answered the phone, after she had refused to help me. “I don’t know that, do I?” she replied.In fairness, she had a good reason not to talk. According to a 1985 law, anyone on Nevis disclosing financial information without a court order is liable to a prison term of up to a year, as well as a fine of $10,000. (This is another area where Nevis is resisting the trend towards openness. Cayman previously had a similar law against breaching confidentiality, but decriminalised the offence in 2016.) When I tried phoning the registered office of Tallberg and Uniwell, the receptionist refused to even tell me where the office was, so I couldn’t visit. When I emailed the NITC, there was no reply. Eventually I had to accept that it was not going to be possible to make contact with them, which meant the true ownership information for the three LLPs was undiscoverable.And it is not just journalists who are unable to check the reliability of Nevis’ financial information for themselves foreign police can’t either. That means we are all reliant on the Nevis financial services regulatory commission to do it for us. The commission is based in an office in the centre of Charlestown, and is run by Heidi-Lynn Sutton, its chief regulator, who works in an office on the first floor.Sutton started off unfriendly, and became less friendly as our 45-minute chat progressed, her manner becoming increasingly exasperated. She flatly dismissed the US state department’s description of Nevis as “a desirable location for criminals to conceal proceeds”. It was simply untrue, she said, that Nevis had anonymous bank accounts, bank secrecy and an opaque corporate register.This was odd, since her regulator’s own website states that bank account holders on the island have no obligation to provide any “statement, return or information (to) … the regulator or the minister”. However, Sutton defended Nevis against all allegations, no matter how serious. The heavy cost of bringing proceedings in Nevis court, for example, was simply to protect the justice system from being “bombarded with frivolous lawsuits”, rather than to protect the wealthy. “That is our weeding-out mechanism,” she said. “Some countries are very litigious. If you get a little burn on your hand because you spill a McDonald’s coffee, somebody will sue you.”When I explained the difficulty I had faced in even finding NITC, Sutton laughed, asking why I was looking for it. I explained that I had hoped to discover who actually owned the limited partnerships on the British registry. When I asked about whether the regulator she\u0026nbspruns might have failed to notice a number of serious money-laundering schemes, she simply said: “I can’t speak to that, I really cannot speak to that.”What about the fact that the former ruling families of Taiwan and Ukraine, as well as lower-profile crooks from all over the world, had used Nevis vehicles to obscure the ownership of their stolen assets? Sutton laughed again. “I can’t accept that there has been multiple usage of our structures to facilitate whatever. I can’t accept hearing it from you. I won’t be able to speak to that.”If the island is so clean, why did online trolls looking to smear Emmanuel Macron before the 2017 French presidential election create fake documents supposedly showing he had a shell company in Nevis? Isn’t that a\u0026nbspsign that the industry Sutton oversees has an image problem? “People make things up all the time,” she replied. “Once you are an international financial centre,\u0026nbspand provide certain services, you will always be\u0026nbspa target, it doesn’t mean that it’s true.”I have spent most of the last four years researching financial crimes, and have spoken to dozens of regulators and investigators in multiple jurisdictions, but never before\u0026nbsphad I met one who responded in such a way to allegations of grand corruption, money laundering and fraud that I was making against their jurisdiction.Like any financial centre, Nevis must choose between turning away dirty money, or attracting as much business as it can. I did not find my visit to Nevis reassuring.Since Nevisian officials appear happy with the current situation, it is up to outsiders to force change on the island, and sadly – thanks to the constitutional peculiarities of the federation – this is all but impossible. We\u0026nbspknow this because it has been tried.In 1995, in federation-wide elections, the St Kitts and Nevis Labour party swept to power with seven of the 11 federal seats, and its leader, Denzil Douglas, became prime minister. He had no seats on Nevis, but did not need any to pass laws for the whole federation. Among his priorities was restricting Nevis’ sordid financial sector. “We were aware that the international community had begun to frown upon Nevis, and on the international financial services that were poorly regulated, not supervised, etc,” said Douglas when we met in his office in Basseterre, the federal capital, which is on St Kitts. “And we sought to bring in new legislation. So they had their referendum.”In 2000, the Financial Action Task Force – a Paris-based group created by the G7 to develop policies against money-laundering – blacklisted the whole of St Kitts and Nevis, as one of 15 countries deemed to be non-cooperative. That forced Nevis to agree to federal legislation, but did not change the basic dynamic that it has significantly more autonomy than Scotland has within the UK, and in some ways more than inidual US states. One financial professional in Basseterre described the relationship between Nevis and St Kitts as like that of a\u0026nbspteenager with access to his big brother’s credit card.None of the tools that large countries have used against tax havens such as Switzerland or Jersey – diplomatic pressure, legal proceedings against banks, and so on – are applicable to Nevis. It is part of a fully independent country (unlike the BVI or Gibraltar) and the companies providing its services (unlike the Swiss banks targeted by the US Department of Justice) are not large enough to\u0026nbspfear losing their offices in the US.Major western countries will have to make their criticism of Nevis via diplomatic channels, if they want it to change its ways. Brantley got his retaliation in first, however, accusing the British government of hypocrisy.“It is no secret that the UK, and London in particular, has a disproportionate number of wealthy Russians, for\u0026nbspexample, and wealthy oligarchs from all around the\u0026nbspworld, and the question is: why? It can’t be for the weather. So, why are people flocking to London? So, if the United Kingdom can do that, then what is the issue with other countries, not as endowed as the UK, trying to stand on their own two feet?”The issue is that if every jurisdiction thinks only of how to stand on its own two feet – whether that’s post-Brexit Britain, Nevis or Wyoming – we will all be pushed over separately by the world’s crooks and thieves. Brantley is right that we all need to do more to fight kleptocrats and fraudsters, but by keeping their secrets and making money from it, Nevis is stopping the rest of\u0026nbspus from moving forward.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e172b1bddb8c55ced280b6d2eba1517a3e06c7e/208_300_2563_1538/master/2563.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf3f5508dac58e72f95ae840354fb2ec","title":"world cup finals the open at carnoustie and athletics aggro","story":"This week’s roundup also includes Wimbledon classics, competitive tags and the luckiest golf shots ever1) It’s France v Croatia in Sunday’s World Cup final, so let’s take a look back at previous editions – starting with the most disappointing final of all. Brazil v Italy, at the Pasadena Rose Bowl in 1994. Maybe fast forward to the end. Italia 90’s showcase wasn’t much better. Much, much better came four years earlier in the Azteca Stadium Diego Maradona’s pass for Jorge Burruchaga’s Argentina winner is sublime. Perhaps the greatest team performance in a final came in that same stadium in 1970 – Brazil, Pelé, Rivellino, Jairzinho, Gerson, Clodoaldo and, for the coup de grace, Carlos Alberto. The biggest shock came when West Germany beat Hungary in 1954, the “Miracle of Bern”. The most ultra-violent? Try 2006 and Zinedine Zidane’s headbutt.2) The weekend will also see the men’s and women’s finals at Wimbledon. Difficult not to start our look back anywhere else but Borg v McEnroe in 1980. From the same era, Navratilova v Evert was the great rivalry in the women’s singles. A forgotten men’s final? How about Richard Krajicek vs MaliVai Washington from 1996? And if you have a spare six hours, you can watch the Federer v Nadal epic from 2008 in full. Goran Ivanisevic’s win over Pat Rafter in 2001 was pretty decent, too. One year later, Serena Williams beat Venus for her first singles title at SW19. One from the deep archive here: Maria Bueno, who died last month, wins the 1959 title. 3) The Open starts next week at Carnoustie, and that can only bring back memories of one thing: Jean van de Velde and his nightmare on the 18th hole, trousers pulled up, the Barry Burn, Peter Alliss and all that. Here’s a guide to one of the toughest courses in links golf and some highlights from 2007, when Padraig Harrington won his first Open. In 1975, Tom Watson also won his first Open of five and back in 1968, Gary Player won his second Open of three. 4) The London Stadium will host the new Athletics World Cup this weekend. It sounds a lot like the old Athletics World Cup, which ran from 1977 to 2007. Here’s some footage from 1989, when European champions Team GB reached a sodden Barcelona, with Seb Coe losing out in the 1500m, but Linford Christie winning the 100m. Here’s an overview of the event from 1989. Staying with athletics, Yomif Kejelcha grabs hold of Ethiopian compatriot Selemon Barega’s shorts in the Diamond League, leading to unseemly scuffling. Not quite as brutal as the punch Haile Gebrselassie once took in the 10,000m at the World Junior Championships.5) The death of Alan Gilzean, the “King of White Hart Lane”, conjured thoughts of Tottenham in the late 60s and early 70s, including being a foil for goalscorer Martin Chivers in the 1972 Uefa Cup final. Here, in 1964, Gilzean scores the goal in a 1-0 win for Scotland over England at Hampden Park. Before joining Spurs, he was star of Dundee’s 1961-62 Scottish title win, including these four goals against Rangers at Ibrox. 6) And finally, if you thought England’s finishing at the World Cup needed some work, check this out.1) How about a game of competitive tag? 3) Horse racing doyen Brough Scott looks back on his career in sport, broadcasting and journalism with Nick ‘The Tache’ Collins.

So why aren’t more people talking about it?Anyone with even a passing interest in baseball knows that Mike Trout is, and has been since not long after breaking through as a teenager in 2012, the best player in the sport in a way that defies easy categorization.And it’s all tempered by a single-minded hunger to shore up what few holes exist in his game. Early-career nitpicks which included his average defense in center field and susceptibility to high fastballs, have been ironed out through shoe-leather dedication to his craft. Trout, who turns 27 next month, has finished either first or second in Most Valuable Player voting in every full season he’s played, coming in fourth last year despite missing nearly a quarter of the season due to injury. But the scary part, at least for pitchers, is the south Jersey native is only getting better. Behold his staggering 2018 campaign to date, which may come to represent his pièce de résistance. He doesn’t lead the league in any of the traditional Triple Crown categories (though, notably, he’s the pacesetter in walks), but a quick e into the alphabet soup of advanced statistics make a compelling case that Trout is on pace for the most prolific inidual season in baseball history, challenging Babe Ruth’s epochal 1923 campaign.The acronyms can be dizzying so let’s stick with wins above replacement player (WAR) – a rough composite figure that measures a player’s total contributions to his team. Once again Trout is so far ahead of the pack it’s laughable. His career WAR of 61.1 – 60 is considered the baseline for a Hall of Fame career – suggests he’d be a cinch for Cooperstown if he retired tomorrow. By the end of the year he will likely have the most career WAR ever for a player of his age. His only competition is himself.So how is a player who’s demonstrably operating in the rarified air of a LeBron James or Serena Williams or Lionel Messi, brokering in the sort of transcendent ability that normally commands the general public’s imagination, somehow doing it under the radar? Sure, there’s not an avid baseball fan alive who’s not in awe of Trout’s craft. But a crossover star he is not. The gnawing reality is the average person on the street, even if his name rings a bell, might struggle to pick him out of a lineup. There have been no shortage of theories proffered. The notion of east coast bias in sports media surely carries less weight than decades ago when print set the agenda and games played out west ended too late to make it into the paper, but there’s no question Trout’s exposure is undercut by playing in Los Angeles (Anaheim, really) – and not for the more fashionable Dodgers – which means a lion’s share of his games don’t start until after 10pm ET. It certainly doesn’t help that Trout’s Angels have made the playoffs but once during his career, denying him a crucial platform: the only games many casual fans watch all season. Some have put it down to his quiet, workmanlike demeanor and tendency to eschew self-promotion. Others have argued, as the sport’s TV ratings languish despite stratospheric profits, that people just don’t care as much about baseball anymore.But more than anything we’ve become anesthetized to a greatness that’s broadly unexplainable and borne from mind-numbing consistency, something that demands to be seen on a nightly basis to be fully appreciated. Yes, it’s strange that baseball’s best player, who in a decade’s time barring injury may be in the conversation for the greatest to ever play the game, is not more famous. It also couldn’t be more immaterial. So put on the coffee for those late-night first pitches and do your best to enjoy the show, because there won’t be another quite like him any time soon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8780d6ed0c6630db6298f295ac2ff924464d2751/0_165_3348_2009/master/3348.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a57cd34b4d0efe993963fae964393922","title":"england v india first cricket odi live","story":"Bairstow is bamboozled by the wrong’un, a little faster and fuller than before. It is given not out, but Kohli appeals. The review shows Bairstow was hit on the back leg and there’s no escape. Root is completely deceived by a ball from Kuldeep that spins back in. He plays down the wrong line and is hit on the knee roll. Out, out out.12th over: England 81-1 (Root 3, Bairstow 38) Root and Bairstow tweak at Chahal, running four singles. Root is twitchy, bat and legs in a tangle to Chahal’s penultimate ball.11th over: England 77-1 (Root 1, Bairstow 36) An important breakthrough for India, now Root must come in and bat against the spinners on a dry pitch. He’s the only England batsman rated in the ODI top ten, but he’s considered under pressure. Crikey, life can be unfair sometimes. Roy tries to reverse sweep, slips, slightly loses his balance, and chips Kuldeep to cover where Yadav takes an easy catch10th over: England 71-0 (Roy 36, Bairstow 33) Hardik replaces Siddarth, Roy flicks him to the short boundary, wristily, behind square for four. A very clever shot. And that’s the power play over - England on top, if they haven’t been allowed to totally let loose. This from Smylers: “As cricketing stats go ‘Root dismissals, if yorkers included’ doesn’t really make sense, but as a crossword clue (for a word unrelated to cricket) it was enough to get me runner-up in a competition on this site’s Crossword Blog (https:www.thecrosswordscrossword-blog2018jul09crossword-roundup-whats-so-corny-about-corn). Anybody else managed to crowbar cricketing references into places that, frankly, weren’t asking for them?”9th over: England 63-0 (Roy 29, Bairstow 32) Aha, we have spin. This is where it gets interesting. Chahal, a slip of a man, shirt half in, half out, pink arm sleeves under his shirt, steps in and rolls his wrist. England are wary, nervous, scuttling a few singles. A reverse-sweep for four by Roy off the last ball isn’t totally convincing. 8th over: England 56-0 (Roy 24, Bairstow 30) A flick, a veritable flick for six from Bairstow brings up the fifty for England. How does he do that? It seems all in the wrist, with minimal use of those pumped up arms. Trent Bridge roars in delight.7th over: England 47-0 (Roy 23, Bairstow 22) It is Roy’s turn to dominate, meatier than Bairstow, less fluent, just as devastating. First a thick outside-edge down to the boundary, then a clever shot through the vacant third man. Ten from the over. 6th over: England 37-0 (Roy 14, Bairstow 21) Siddarth has an expensive over from the Ratcliffe Road end. Bairstow is looking devastating, hits Siddarth on the up through the off side for four, repeats it slightly straighter next ball but just gets the single - his first run that isn’t a boundary. Then Roy joins in with a huge bat-whafting, tip-toeing four though the off side.Some statty stuff: since the last world cup England have won 46 ODIs, lost 19, India won 39, lost 19 - the only two teams to have won more than 2 x the games they’ve lost. Hope that scans.5th over: England 26-0 (Roy 8, Bairstow 16) Roy keeps driving, keeps failing to get past India’s first line of defence. He punches one past Yadav on his follow-through, oooosh, it catches him hard on the side of his left hand. A potential caught and bowled if you were feeling particularly vindictive. Bairstow is seeing the ball better, tickles the last ball of the over round his legs down to the boundary.4th over: England 21-0 (Roy 7, Bairstow 12) Skiddy Siddarth keeps things tight, one ball keeps a little low, another bounces unevenly, and England struggle to pierce the inner ring. Kohli fiddling with his slip cordon -wider, closer, one slip, two. 3rd over: England 20-0 (Roy 6, Bairstow 12) Forget what I said about a slow start, Bairstow has other ideas. He off-drives Yadav for a glorious four, and the next ball betters it with a superlative back-foot punch to the cover-boundary. A satorial suggestion from Nuggehalli Nigam “How do we get the English public interested in this game after the football mania? Perhaps Shastri should wear a waistcoat and look pensive?”2nd over: England 11-0 (Roy 5, Bairstow 4) Siddarth Kaul, pink headband, left ear-stud, fancy, is on the money until the fifth ball, which Bairstow pulls with a angled bat to the boundary. A slow start by England standards. 1st over: England 6-0 (Roy 4, Bairstow 0)  A mixed bag from the ponytailed Yadav. The first ball is full, Roy edges and the ball flies past first slip down to the boundary for four. Then an away-swinger beats a static Bairstow. A wide. Then a huge appeal, high and straight against Bairstow - but India decide not to appeal. Hawkeye though, says out. And we’re off, through the tunnel of flags, out onto dry, dry Trent Bridge. I’ve just seen a man walking across the outfield in a waterproof jacket, which suggests that the weather has toned down its attitude for the occasion. But expect runs aplenty: last time England batted here they knocked up a mammoth 481 for 6. In fact Trent Bridge is one of their very favourite grounds, the last time they lost an ODI here was in 2014 when India beat them by six wickets.Virat Kohli wins the toss and will bowl first. He oozes confidence out in the middle. “It looks like a pretty hard pitch, we’ve chased well so far... we back ourselves to bowl first.”Eoin Morgan confirms that he would have done the same.Hello sore heads and none, and welcome to the first of the three-match ODI series between England and India. Today we’re at Trent bridge - where local boy Alex Hales is out with a side injury (though he would have been left out anyway) and Dawid Malan has been called up as cover. Joe Root - one half-century in six ODI innings this summer - is back after his turn carrying the drinks in last IT20 game. Ben Stokes is back too, batting at No.5, despite being very light on bowling. Mark Wood returns.India are without the injured Jasprit Bumrah, but with the wrist-spin wizards Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav. England have been practising against Merlyn - we wait to see how that has gone. For those nursing disappointment from last night, be consoled that this time next year England and India could be battling it out for a place in the final of the Cricket World Cup..This series will give us a taster of what we can look forward to - the top two white-ball sides in the world. If India win 3-0, they leapfrog over England back to the top of the rankingsFirst blood this summer to India. Two intriguing months to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ec00ddd64d7e5a7ead4e6ba39d8c511727f6248/167_357_3960_2376/master/3960.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d917edf200399221765c546e64a3edcb","title":"tour de france stage six live","story":"137km to go: Smith reaches the summit first, and pockets a couple of points.

They are now nearly six minutes ahead of the peloton.“I have noticed some bikes in the peloton with disc brakes and others traditional rim brakes,” writes Ian Macaskill. “What is the feeling in the peloton about the mix, especially when big downhill stages with braking into corners are encountered?” Disc brakes were only introduced to the Tour last year and are still very much lesser spotted, though André Greipel and his Lotto Soudal team-mates have all used them this year, for the first time. Peter Sagan spoke about using them last week, and said he expected to use them in most stages of the Tour:The next significant town on the route is Plounéventer, AKA Gwineventer in Breton. The history of the town on its website has a chapter on “mayors, lawyers and tax collecters”, which doesn’t sound enormously exciting.160km to go: The breakaway group has extended their lead to very nearly five minutes.Groupama’s Olivier du Gac comes from Plouvien, so this will be a special day for him.

More than 500 times? How about the sheer number of notifications you get? It might number in the thousands.With all the talk of smartphone addiction, I was curious to find out just how often I actually use my phone and why, so I took Apple’s new Screen Time phone-tracking tools for a spin, installing the latest iOS 12 beta. What I discovered is that I pick up my phone every seven minutes during the day – far more than I imagined, and not just at the prompt of a notification.I’ll admit to suffering from phantom notifications, the feeling that your phone has just buzzed even through it hasn’t. Now I have the data to prove it.While I picked up the phone more than 1,000 times in the week, close to 150 times a day, I actually only received around 700 notifications in a week. That means I pick up and actually interact with my phone, not just look at the time, around 50 times a day without prompting.Obviously some of that is looking things up or proactively sending messages and emails. But the rest I put down to that nervous twitch to check my phone.Screen Time revealed something surprising in the apps I use too. During the week Safari was my go-to app more than anything else, spending almost three hours browsing the web. That was a full hour longer than I spent in Netflix, and twice as long as I spent in Mail, even thought it feels like all I do these days is answer emails with close to 300 notifications a week.Having dumped Twitter in April 2017, and turned everything off on Facebook, social media doesn’t figure much in my usage. The messaging app Signal comes in with only an hour’s worth of usage, despite getting close to 200 notifications from it – the second most demanding of my attention this week.The number of apps I spent 45 minutes or less with are numerous, and include Reeder, the Google app, Facebook and Pocket, which explains why my “read it later” list just keeps on growing – 45 minutes just isn’t enough to get through all those long reads.Curiously I use my phone more frequently on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Why that is, I haven’t been able to work out, but the rest of my usage – even at weekends – is consistent with a minimum of three hours spent staring at the little screen a day.It turns out my weekdays are also fairly consistent too, with a burst of 45 minutes spent jabbing at the screen between 8-9am, and another 35 minutes between 5-6pm. I can also see that Facebook is almost exclusively used only on a Saturday, the Amazon app primarily only on a Sunday, and Mail peaks on a Wednesday.All these patterns and more are plain to see when you have the data on hand, which is precisely what Apple’s Screen Time and Google’s upcoming Dashboard aim to do. While I wouldn’t say I’m addicted to my phone (although maybe I’m just in denial), I certainly pick it up more than I thought I would. Perhaps it’s time to put the phone down and ignore the vibrations, real or not."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/385ae940160c6b1f6bb7c9744e7cf379dd054699/0_97_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4b35fb614d535c3fd8ae21637a6c36d","title":"can i add an iphone and chromebook to my all microsoft system","story":"If Paul adds an iPhone and Chromebook to his Microsoft devices, will it lead to a mess of email addresses and accounts?Over the past few years I have been using all Microsoft-oriented products: a Windows 10 laptop and desktop, a Windows phone (Lumia 950) and a Surface 2 (Windows RT) tablet. One advantage is that they all log on to a single Windows account with an Outlook email address. I use Outlook (from Office 365) to manage my email, contacts and calendar.Because of the poor app support for the phone and Surface 2, I’m wondering about getting an iPhone and a Chromebook to replace the tablet and laptop. My laptop needs are likely to diminish once I have finished my PhD, and will be mainly email, word processing and presentations.I’m concerned that this is going to leave me with a mess of email addresses and accounts – an iCloud address for the phone, a Gmail address for the Chromebook, and the ongoing Windows account. PaulWhen this column started, in a previous century, most users only had one PC. Home users did not have broadband, so email was collected via a dial-up modem. Some people had handheld “organisers” from Palm, Psion and other suppliers, but they synced with PCs. Life was simple. Since then things have changed dramatically, with the arrival of smartphones, mass-market tablets, ultraportable laptops, always-on home broadband and widely available internet connections via wireless hotspots and 3G4G cellular services. Most homes now have a plethora of connected devices, from media servers to light bulbs. Instead of syncing with a local PC, things sync via cloud-based services that make your data accessible from almost any smart device almost anywhere.But whose cloud will you use? For many purposes, there are three major ecosystems, run by Apple, Google and Microsoft. Each company offers its own devices, browsers, operating systems, email service, online applications and cloud storage. Devices often push people to adopt one ecosystem rather than another, which is the heart of your problem. However, you can use all your devices with your current Outlook account.The three major ecosystems are very similar, but some differences reflect the way each company makes money.Apple makes most of its money by selling devices, mainly iPhones, iPads and Macs. Its cloud services are intended to make its devices more appealing, partly by helping them to work well together. It mostly avoids doing software for non-Apple devices, with iTunes for Windows and the Apple Music app for Android being notable exceptions.Google makes most of its money from selling targeted advertising, which is based on analysing your data and behaviour. It doesn’t much care which devices you use, but it wants you to use its Chrome browser to access its online properties such as Gmail and YouTube. Basically, it wants everything done online.As a result, Microsoft offers the most complete ecosystem for supporting different devices and both online and offline use. Indeed, as a Windows Phone user, you may already know that Microsoft provides better support for iPhone and Android phone users than it does for you.If you buy an Android phone, tablet or Chromebook, you will inevitably end up with a Google account, but you don’t have to use the associated Gmail address. If you don’t email people from Gmail, they won’t even know your address.You can set Gmail to forward all incoming email to your Outlook account, and set up a rule to file it in a Gmail folder. However, accessing Gmail in a browser provides easy access to Google Drive, which provides 15GB of free online storage. Go to Drive and you can create documents in Google’s online applications, which include Docs, Sheets and Slides.You already have Office 365 with 1TB of storage space, so these won’t be of much interest, but they can sometimes come in handy.In passing, the potentially problematic Google Drive app for Windows PCs and Macs was killed off in March. It has been replaced by Backup and Sync for Google Photos and Google Drive.My advice: use Google Takeout to do backups.You will need an Apple ID to use an iPhone, and the setup procedure will prompt you to set up an Apple email address. However, millions of people have Apple IDs with non-Apple email addresses, thanks to the widespread use of Apple iTunes on Windows PCs. In fact, you can sign up for an Apple ID on the web, using any email address you like. Apple will send an email to the address you provide, and you must enter the code to verify your account.If you buy an iPhone, you can also access your Apple ID account from your PC’s web browser. This lets you use online applications such as Pages, Numbers and Keynote, and provides 5GB of free iCloud storage. You can also download an iCloud app to your Windows PC.Alternatively, the Files app in iOS lets you use different online storage services such as Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, Amazon Drive and Dropbox. Just tap Locations in the top left and turn on the ones you need.Microsoft provides dozens of apps for iPhones, iPads and Android devices. At the moment there are 86 for the iPhone and 93 for Android. The most useful include Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, OneDrive, Office Lens, Cortana and Microsoft Remote Desktop.Install the Outlook app on your iPhone (or your Android phone or tablet) and you should have no problems using your current Outlook email address.Microsoft Office apps also run on newer Chromebooks that host a full copy of the Android operating system, and they are free if the Chromebook has a 10.1in or smaller screen. Alternatively you can use the free online Office apps in the Chrome browser. These include Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Photos, OneNote and OneDrive. If you buy a Chromebook with a larger screen, you can only use the apps if you have an Office 365 account, but you still won’t get access to the full programs. They only run on Windows PCs and Macs.I recommend trying a recent touchscreen Chromebook before buying one. You will need a 360-degree hinge for it to work as a tablet, or a detachable keyboard like the new (coming soon!) HP Chromebook X2.I think Chromebooks are still too limited to provide a real substitute for a Windows 10 convertible or a tablet. They are fine for email and browsing, but many models don’t handle touch well, if at all. Also, most Android apps have been designed for smartphones. Relatively few have been adapted for larger screens, or for Chromebooks.The Android tablet market is struggling, and Google may be planning to replace Android with Chrome OS. The Acer Chromebook Tab 10 tablet is an example. One benefit is that you won’t have to rely on a tablet manufacturer to update the Android operating system.Have you got a question?

So she’s brought that creative buzz into a multi-faceted retail space.Joining up with another clothing designer, The Grunge Monkey, Hyndman launched The 2nd Floor in Chester in April. The idea was to make it a place where people could come in to get a feel for her brand, but also where creative minds could relax and be inspired. Within it, she has set up a coffee shop, a space for artists to showcase their work and an area for local musicians to play and sell records. “We feel really passionately about what we do, but also about the creative community around us. We wanted to offer that support to other people in our position,” she says.Hyndman knows many sides of the creative industry, putting her in a good place to make the space work. Not only does she sell her own clothes, but she splits her time with her band, Campfire Social, and is a keen wakeboarder and surfer. Each summer, she travels from festival to festival, sets up shop, meets new people and sells her clothes to like-minded folk.“Part of the whole idea of the brand is going out travelling and being outdoors. I don’t want to lose that,” she says. “It’s great to have a place that reflects that.”Hyndman started Junkbox Apparel as an online clothing shop in 2013, drawing on a background in retail and her jewellery design hobby. “It came from my own interests and what I wanted in my wardrobe – leisurewear for people who enjoy the outdoors.” The name she picked out with her mum, inspired by where people tend to store their accessories, in particular their costume jewellery. “You used to call that junk jewellery, hence where Junkbox came from,” she says. “It applies to what the brand is now: you chuck your stuff in a bag and you’re off.”The idea of travelling light evolved from her days of going on holiday with a different outfit packed for each day. “I hate doing that now, but I still like to look good and I like to be comfortable.” Which is why she came up with the capsule set: a few items of clothes that centre around a similar colour palette and activity that mix and match, so they are all that is needed for a weekend away. “You chuck them in a bag and you’re done,” she says.It’s a simple concept, but growing the business has been anything but smooth sailing. Hyndman believes there is “no original idea any more” – instead, building a business means carving out a niche, getting the brand name noticed, and collaborating rather than competing. “I think that encourages you to look at what you’re doing,” she says. “Looking at the competition and making it not competition, making them your peers.”“The nice thing is, I take a little bit less along to festivals now,” she says. “I used to take a clipboard, notebook, stock sheets, and loads of things like that. The stock management side of it became a little bit of hard work. Now I just take a little box with my carrier bags, my Square Reader and then my van with as much stock as I can fit into it.”Having launched The 2nd Floor in April, Hyndman has bigger plans for Junkbox Apparel. “I want to say take over the world, but we won’t be doing that any time soon – I’ve got to be realistic,” she laughs.Learn more about Square"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97b0b0c16bd7eb4366318d8c56a6ecc4abe5fdd0/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f9c38b7783c19d74eae516449ee7c57","title":"catalan president cites scottish model in call for independence poll","story":"Exclusive: Quim Torra insists there is consensus for fresh referendum during SNP visitThe new president of Catalonia, Quim Torra, has insisted he has a strong mandate to push for another independence referendum, as he visited Scotland for a meeting with the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon.“Spain never has an answer to our question: why don’t we do something like the Scottish people did? We even tell them: remember that the pro-independence side lost in Scotland. Holding a referendum doesn’t mean we are going to win.”Torra, a hardline Catalan nationalist handpicked by the region’s deposed president, Carles Puigdemont, was sworn in in May. Until then, Catalonia had been under direct rule from Madrid since the end of October in 2017, when the then prime minister Mariano Rajoy responded to Puigdemont’s unilateral independence referendum and declaration of independence by firing the Catalan president and his cabinet and calling new elections.The choreography of the meeting on Wednesday evening with the SNP leader will be closely observed by independence supporters in Scotland and Catalonia alike.The Scottish government was criticised by some pro-independence activists for its circumspect official response to events in Catalonia, while other party insiders pointed to Sturgeon’s reluctance to set a precedent for other governments to interfere with Scottish independence.Describing Catalonia’s admiration for “the Scottish model”, he described its September 2014 independence refereudum as “an example for the world”.Speaking before his meeting with Sturgeon, Torra said Catalan independence supporters had “great expectations” of the meeting, but added it was for the first minster to decide whether to publicly support a referendum for Catalonia on the lines of the Scottish model. Given the SNP’s historic reluctance to promote or endorse other independence movements, this is notably the first time that Sturgeon has met a Catalan president. Torra was also visiting Scotland to lend his support to Clara Ponsatí, the St Andrews academic who returned to her native Catalonia last summer to take up a post as education minister under Puigdemont and now faces extradition proceedings early next month on charges of rebellion.Torra said he was certain that the pending extraditions of the former Catalan government minister in Germany, Belgium and Switzerland, as well as Scotland, would fail, stating that he had “confidence in European justice and the separation of powers”. But he added he still could not understand why the EU had not condemned Spain’s violent response to last October’s referendum. Torra, who has been dogged by accusations that he is little more than a puppet for Puigdemont, said that is was “natural” for him to describe his predecessor as the “legitimate president” following his deposition, and confirmed he talks to him “practically every day”.Torra had his first meeting with the new Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, who replaced Rajoy at the beginning of July, on Monday. It was reported to be a cordial exchange, although how much progress is possible when the Spanish and Catalan positions remain essentially entrenched is questionable.Torra warned: “We’ll see in the following weeks if the Spanish government really wants to solve this matter politically, we should see proposals and alternatives on the table.”He denied that anti-Spanish statements he has made in the past made him a controversial negotiating partner for Spain, and also insisted there was no “fracture” in Catalan society over the issue, despite reports suggesting that opinions are as split as they are in Scotland.

Protests took place outside the parliament building and one conservative opposition party, Top 09, staged a symbolic walkout. In the end, 105 MPs in the 200-member chamber voted for the new government. One leading Social Democrat, Milan Chovanec, a former interior minister, declined to give his backing, citing his conscience. The show of support came after the communists signed a deal with ANO agreeing to “tolerate” the new government – overriding ideological misgivings about Babiš’ wealthy status in exchange for having some policy pledges adopted and being given influential roles in public utilities.Although the party will formally remain outside the coalition, the agreement marks a return to influence and responsibility for the first time since the 1989 Velvet Revolution that ended the communists’ 41-year rule of the former Czechoslovakia.MPs from a conservative opposition party, Top 09, walked out in protest before Wednesday’s vote, while members of the right-wing Christian Democrat party unfurled a banner featuring Soviet red star in a vivid sign of enduring anti-communist feeling in the country.Demonstrations have been staged in Prague and other cities against the rehabilitation of a party still remembered bitterly for its totalitarian methods and ruthless clampdown on dissent during the cold war.“For many people who support right-of-centre parties, this is a big moral and psychological problem, because they see it in symbolic terms and feel it’s not right,” said Jiří Pehe, director of New York University’s campus in Prague and a Czech political analyst.Babiš, who was sworn in as prime minister for a second time last month, disregarded such qualms after more moderate parties declined to serve under him because he faces criminal fraud charges over allegations that he falsely obtained nearly €2m of EU funds for his giant agrochemical business a decade ago. He denies the charges, which he has called politically motivated.Babiš, the Czech Republic’s second-richest man, has also been tarred with a communist past after being named as a former secret police agent when he worked for a Czechoslovak trading company, a charge he disputes.He won communist support for his coalition by agreeing to tax church property that had been restored to it after being seized while the party was in power. However, he has resisted their demands to dilute the Czech Republic’s commitments to Nato, knocking back its demand to cut troop deployments to the Baltic republics and Afghanistan.Babiš’ previous caretaker administration also angered the communists – considered close to the government of Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin – by expelling three of Moscow’s diplomats in solidarity with Britain over the poisoning of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury.“Babiš has done all this because he feels he doesn’t have democratic legitimacy and is suspected of not being a true liberal democrat,” said Pehe. “He wants to look pro-western, pro-Nato and pro-EU – and he’s made it clear to the communists that he’s not going to compromise on that.”But his government is certain to maintain a hardline anti-migrant stance after Miloš Zeman, the populist Czech president, refused to accept the Social Democrats’ nominee for foreign minister, the MEP Miroslav Poche, on the grounds that he was too liberal on immigration."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fee33f744c927379c146594dc8ade182203e26d/0_219_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91efcf2f060d739113a49884c8885f5c","title":"north korea children malnourished un visit","story":"UN official touring country said there were also issues with access to clean water and lack of medical suppliesAbout a fifth of all North Korean children are affected by malnutrition, the most senior United Nations humanitarian aid official has said during a tour of the country, the first such visit since 2011.Mark Lowcock, the under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs, made the comments at the end of the first day of his tour of North Korea, which he has said is aimed at raising awareness of the dire conditions faced by ordinary people.“One of the things we’ve seen is very clear evidence of humanitarian need here,” he said in a video posted to the UN website and his official Twitter account. “More than half the children in rural areas, including the places we’ve been, have no clean water, contaminated water sources.”Lowcock met with Kim Yong-chol, North Korea’s official head of state, and health minister Jang Jun-sang, according the North’s official Korean Central News Agency.Humanitarian aid is exempt from UN sanctions placed on North Korea as punishment for developing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, but officials have warned aid shipments are still delayed due to the trade restrictions.Lowcock also visited a hospital which does not receive support from the UN where there were 140 patients afflicted with tuberculosis but only enough medicine for 40 people. Hospitals across the country lack medical supplies and equipment, meaning most cannot provide care “in a way that would pass basic humanitarian thresholds”.He said access for aid workers in the country was improving, but did not provide specifics. His trip is partially focused on spurring donations, with the UN saying it needs to raise $111m (£84m) to provide aid for six million people in the areas of health, water, sanitation and food security. The UN has had to suspend some programs, such as nutrition support for kindergartens, because of a lack of funds. Despite North Korea’s inability to provide basic necessities for its people, the government has rebuffed offers to relinquish its nuclear weapons program for aid and investment aimed at sparking economic growth. North Korean officials have been far more focused on security guarantees.While US and South Korean officials have made some concessions, like suspending military exercises, and are reportedly exploring investment projects in the event of sanctions relief, permanent military reductions have so far been refused. South Korean president Moon Jae-in reiterated in an interview with Singapore’s Straits Times that US troops would remain in the country despite a deal with the North.“South Korea and the US maintain a firm stance about the role and importance of US Forces Korea for peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia,” Moon said. “It is a matter of the South Korea-US alliance, not something that can be discussed in denuclearisation talks between North Korea and the US.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05b284d1fabe3f68eb080b344bae5e4d1865524d/0_13_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbb83801df6db07abe27277d22729d78","title":"nato summit world leaders gather in pictures","story":"Donald Trump and Theresa May pose with other world leaders for traditional ‘family’ photographs at Nato’s Brussels headquarters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3562641.1531392688!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"exterminating rats could save coral reefs scientists say","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tExterminating black rats on tropical islands is the best way to help coral reefs, a team of scientists has concluded. Photograph: iStockExterminating black rats on tropical islands is the best way to help coral reefs, including their fish, an international team of scientists has established.Exterminating the rats should therefore be an urgent conservation priority, they recommend.The scientists studied tropical ecosystems in remote islands in the Indian Ocean to find out how rats impact on surrounding reefs. They compared islands with and without rats.Their results – published as lead paper in the latest issue of journal Nature – confirmed rats decimate seabirds, but also damage the ecology of the coral reefs that encircle and protect the islands.“Rats on islands decrease fish life and coral reef health,” paper author Dr Nicholas Graham told the EuroScience Open Forum in Toulouse. The study was carried out at the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean.The islands were a perfect “laboratory” setting as some are rat-free, while others are infested with black rats - thought to have been introduced in the late 1700s and early 1800s.When you step onto a rat-free island, the skies are full of birds, it is noisy and it smells, since their guano is so pungent, said Dr Graham. Islands with rats are far quieter, with almost no seabirds: the rodents eat seabird eggs, chicks and sometimes adult birds.The birds fed far out at sea, roosted on the islands and fertilised them with rich fishy droppings, with a good balance of nitrogen and phosphorous. These nutrients flow out to sea and benefit the coral reef fish.Most coral systems around the world are under immense pressure due to global warming.The size of this fertilising effect surprised the scientists, he said. Fish around islands with no rats grew faster and were more plentiful. The coral reefs around “birdy islands” had around 50 per cent more fish biomass than those around “ratty islands”.The scientists calculated that seabirds, such as terns and noddies, drop 251 times more nitrogen per hectare on rat-free islands than on rat-infested islands. Killing rats is remarkably effective for helping coral reefs, study scientist Dr Aaron MacNeil of Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada, told the meeting.“There is no example as clear cut and effective in enhancing coral reefs in the face of climate change. This is the low hanging fruit,” he said.“We knew seabirds had a big influence on islands, but didn’t know if they influenced coral reefs. Just how much a boost in productivity is going on was quite surprising,” said Dr Graham. He stressed that “the birdy islands” is how islands should look.Unfortunately, 90 per cent of the world’s islands have been decimated by invasive species like rats, mice and cats. It is possible to turn this around.Rat eradication has been completed on 580 islands worldwide. This is usually done by dropping poison from the air.Dr Graham estimated that clearing the Chagos islands of bird-killing black rats would cost 2 or 3 million dollars.Many islands around Ireland and the UK have rats. These might benefit from “de-ratting,” Dr Graham said, but afterwards the docking of boats on the island would have to be carefully controlled so the rats do not return."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Fire service sees increase in call-outs overnight after UVF planned \u0026lsquoserious disorder\u0026rsquoSandra Higgins (37) denied causing serious harm to baby\u0026lsquoWomen in the home\u0026rsquo proposal sent for further scrutiny before voteIllegal shipment of 7.9 million cigarettes discovered aboard vessel from RotterdamDeadline of one hour set for Bill to resolve cases linked to collapse of Setanta InsuranceDonegal local authority reported 10 \u0026lsquoinsidious\u0026rsquo incidents over last three yearsRodents on islands in Indian Ocean decimate seabird populations, new research showsBody of Ana Kriegel was found at a disused farmhouse in MayNumber of people who received swine flu vaccine take legal action alleging narcolepsyFocus Ireland report finds landlords evicting tenants to sell properties is primary cause of family homelessness\u0026lsquoI never have to wait in a queue\u0026rsquo: Record-breaking nails measured nearly 30 feetThe Irish scientist on women\u0026rsquos voices in climate change and tackling Stem\u0026rsquos gender biasA thrilling mix of science, art, technology and design awaits young and old at this year\u0026rsquos eventScheme expanded to include those in receipt of carer\u0026rsquos benefit, says Finian McGrathFavoured option would involve a facility built in sections and transported to the Dublin siteBallot to ban Israeli goods from occupied Palestinian territories passes in SeanadAbout 400 attend ceremony to mark day control of ports given to State in 1938Joan Freeman, Padraig \u0026Oacute\u0026rsquoC\u0026eacuteidigh, Gerard Craughwell or Kevin Sharkey may stand against Michael DEPA says the impact of microplastics on people\u0026rsquos health has not been fully assessedAlmost 3,000 new student beds built in the past year, claims Government report"},{"url":null,"title":"referendum on women s place in the home may be delayed until next year","story":"The referendum on the woman’s place in the home may be delayed until next year, The  understands.The Dáil’s business committee met on Thursday morning and agreed the Bill to allow for a referendum must go through pre-legislative scrutiny.The proposal is to delete Article 41.2 of the Constitution but there has been significant concerns raised as to whether this is the right course of action.It is understood the meeting agreed the Bill must go before the Oireachtas committee on justice in September. The Cabinet decided earlier this month to propose deleting article 41.2 in a referendum likely to be held on October 25th. The Cabinet also formally approved the legislation to allow for a separate referendum, likely to be held on the same day, which would delete the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution. The referendums were to be held in conjunction with the presidential election, if one takes place. It is understood that the blasphemy vote would proceed if the presidential election goes ahead.The women in the home referendum is now likely to be held on the same date as the local and European elections on May 24th, 2019. It is understood Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan has informed Cabinet of the decision.Article 41.2 of the Constitution refers to a woman’s place in the home. It says the State “recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved”.“The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home,” it continues.The Constitutional Convention examined this issue and reported to the Government in 2013. Some 88 per cent of members voted against its inclusion in the Constitution. Ninety eight per cent voted in favour of amending the wording to render it gender-neutral. It was also proposed to include other carers both “in the home” and “beyond the home”.However, the Government has favoured the straightforward deletion, which has proved to be controversial."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"digitalservices@telegraphHead of Digital Publishingdigitalservices@telegraphMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

The Government has already separately cleared Comcast\u0027s bid for Sky.Mr Wright\u0027s predecessor Matt Hancock said last month that Fox\u0027s proposal to sell Sky News to Walt Disney co, or to an alternative buyer, was likely to be the best remedy to assuage concerns about the extent of Mr Murdoch\u0027s influence over the media in Britain.Expressing anger at the decision Clive Lewis, a Labour frontbencher, said: “Understand this for what it is: elites retrenching and digging in for the fight ahead.“This is a government unashamedly fighting for corporate power and oligarchs aka the one per cent.”Under its plans to appease Government concerns, Fox has pledged to offload Sky News to Walt Disney, which is separately bidding to buy a major chunk of Fox assets - including the Sky stake.Fox has also vowed to provide a Disney-owned Sky News channel with funding of at least £100 million a year for 15 years.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The state\u0027s\u0026nbspDepartment of Environmental Quality has said that the water is clean enough to drink – but the problem will not be fixed until the city\u0027s pipes are replaced, and residents have been advised to keep using filters or drink bottled water.Since then, many critics of Mr Musk have taken to reminding him of the problem and the possibility he could fix it on Twitter. One of those reminders appears to have finally worked, after a post that goaded Mr Musk into helping.Hey Elon Musk I heard a bunch of people saying there\u0027s NO WAY you could help get clean water to Flint, Michigan, wrote one Twitter user.\u0026nbspSaid you wouldn\u0027t be capable idk.Mr Musk almost immediately replied to the taunt.Please consider this a commitment that I will fund fixing the water in any house in Flint that has water contamination above FDA levels, he posted.\u0026nbspNo kidding.Mr Musk\u0027s reference to the\u0026nbspFood and Drug Administration is not strictly correct: though bottled water is regulated by the FDA, public tap water is supervised by the Environmental Protection Agency.He then went on to explain in other tweets that he would pay for water filters for all houses that were able to show their water was unclean.

The Government has already separately cleared Comcast\u0027s bid for Sky.Mr Wright\u0027s predecessor Matt Hancock said last month that Fox\u0027s proposal to sell Sky News to Walt Disney co, or to an alternative buyer, was likely to be the best remedy to assuage concerns about the extent of Mr Murdoch\u0027s influence over the media in Britain.Expressing anger at the decision Clive Lewis, a Labour frontbencher, said: “Understand this for what it is: elites retrenching and digging in for the fight ahead.“This is a government unashamedly fighting for corporate power and oligarchs aka the one per cent.”Under its plans to appease Government concerns, Fox has pledged to offload Sky News to Walt Disney, which is separately bidding to buy a major chunk of Fox assets - including the Sky stake.Fox has also vowed to provide a Disney-owned Sky News channel with funding of at least £100 million a year for 15 years.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

A new study suggests not only that the public in the UK and America does have a strong sense of trust in scientific experts, but also that people trust experts more than politicians, even when the experts themselves are espousing “silly ideas”.The large-scale study, conducted by academics at Queen Mary University in London, examined the responses of groups of people to “behavioural nudges”, suggested either by scientists, or by “a government working group consisting of special interest groups and policy makers”.Gove ‘physically ripped up’ official report on customs optionsMichael Gove tells water firms they are getting it \u0027wrong\u0027Ecologically disastrous palm oil \u0027better than alternatives\u0027These nudges were behavioural interventions designed to improve day-to-day decision-making. Some were real and had been implemented, such as using catchy pictures in stairwells to encourage people to take the stairs instead of the lift, while others were fictitious and implausible like the suggestion stirring coffee anti-clockwise for two minutes could help avoid cancerous effects.The study, published in the journal Basic and Applied Social Psychology, found trust was higher for scientists than the government working group, even when the scientists were proposing fictitious nudges.But the work also revealed there is a slight tendency for the US sample to find the nudges more plausible and more ethical overall compared to the UK sample.Lead author Dr Magda Osman, from Queen Mary’s School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, said: “In the context of debates regarding the loss of trust in experts, what we show is that in actual fact, when compared to a government working group, the public in the US and UK judge scientists very favourably, so much so that they show greater levels of trust even when the interventions that are being proposed are implausible and most likely ineffective. “This means that the public still have a high degree of trust in experts, in particular, in this case, social scientists.”She added: “The evidence suggests that trust in scientists is high, but that the public are sceptical about nudges in which they might be manipulated without them knowing. They consider these as less ethical and trust the experts proposing them less with nudges in which they do have an idea of what is going on.”Nudges are an increasingly popular means of influencing decision making, and are used by governments across a wide range of areas including health, personal finance, and general wellbeing.UK news in picturesUS President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May stand together as they gather for a family picture during a Nato summit in Brussels.Serena Williams celebrates after winning against Camila Giorgi during their women\u0027s singles quarter-final match on the eighth day of Wimbledon.

In other words, ask the questions in the right way, and people will show a level of scrutiny that is often not attributed to them. “So, before there are strong claims made about public opinion about experts, and knee-jerk policy responses to this, it might be worth being a bit more careful about how the public are surveyed in the first place.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

outlines\u0026nbspof previously hidden remains before the rain makes them disappear againClick to followThe Independent OnlineHow the current heatwave is providing unprecedented opportunities for archaeologistsThe current heatwave is providing a near-unprecedented bonanza for archaeologists,\u0026nbspas scorched conditions all over Britain expose the previously undiscovered or long-hidden outlines of everything from ancient fortifications to remnants of the\u0026nbspSecond World War.\u0026nbspIn what was described as “a frantic race against time and weather”, archaeologists are scrambling into aeroplanes or flying drones to search for the outlines\u0026nbspwhich are visible from the air as “crop marks”, before they are once more erased by rain.In Wales\u0026nbspalone the new discoveries have included an early medieval cemetery in south Gwynedd, a Roman villa in the Vale of Glamorgan, a prehistoric or Roman farm near Newport and a Roman fortlet near Magor, south Wales.Members of the public are spotting the signs of everything from Bronze Age burial grounds in their local park\u0026nbspto long-forgotten Second World War air raid shelters in back gardens and schools.And for the professionals, something akin to archaeological gold-rush fever has set in.“It’s hugely exciting,” said Louise Barker, a senior archaeological investigator at the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales (RCAHMW).\u0026nbsp“There have been whole new discoveries, covering all periods of time. \u0026nbsp“Our senior aerial investigator Dr Toby Driver is flying all over Wales, going over landscapes and saying, ‘Oh my goodness, there is something I never expected down there.’\u0026nbspHe says so much new archaeology is showing it is incredible.“There probably hasn’t been anything like this for more than 40 years.\u0026nbspIt is pretty spectacular.” \u0026nbspHistoric sites across UK exposed by heatwaveCrop marks show of the old garden at Gawthorpe

and the hottest June on record, a remarkable number of crop marks have appeared, sometimes showing the presence of buried remains that have lain unnoticed for decades or, in the case of the new discoveries, for centuries.Langstone, Newport, south Wales (RCAHMWSWNS)In hot weather, crop marks expose the presence of things like historic buildings or burial mounds\u0026nbspbecause the grass or crops above them grow differently compared to plants in the surrounding soil.A buried ditch that once ringed a\u0026nbsphill fort\u0026nbspwill collect more underground water and nutrients, so the plants above it will grow taller and greener while the hot weather parches all the neighbouring vegetation.\u0026nbspThe underground remains of a wall, meanwhile, will have drier and poorer soil above it, producing shorter and browner plants.Ms Barker explained that the differences are more noticeable in the kind of prolonged hot weather that can affect even normally hardy greenery like grass.\u0026nbspWhich means that when the rain comes, the crop marks vanish again. \u0026nbsp“It’s a frantic race against time and the weather,” said Ms Barker.\u0026nbsp“There is just this window of opportunity, and then, according to the forecast, in the next couple of days the rain will come and it will all be lost again – the outlines will start disappearing before your eyes.”But even though

been investigated at ground level.fortlet whose remains have lain hidden beneath a field near Magor, south Wales, for centuries (RCAHMWSWNS)She said: “We have found a Roman fortlet which will allow us to learn more about where the garrisons were and how the Roman conquest progressed.\u0026nbspWe have found an early medieval cemetery from maybe the eighth or ninth century, with the potential to tell us more about the period that used to be called the Dark Ages. \u0026nbsp“At the known sites, we have seen more and more things come out as it has got drier and drier.”Elsewhere in the UK, emerging

Sir Charles Barry in the 1850s, the garden was covered up after the Second World War.\u0026nbspNow the exceptionally hot weather has allowed National Trust staff to see previously unnoticed features

have achieved, unless you had an unlimited budget and were willing to go slightly mad prospecting in hundreds of farmers’ fields on a hunch or nothing.“I think it will add a huge amount to our knowledge.”The heatwave has also allowed the public to discover their own crop marks revealing everything from wartime Anderson shelters to Bronze Age cremation sites.The result has been a widespread

That is the extent to which our lives are intermeshed with the lives of our European partners,\u0027\u0026nbspformer attorney general saysClick to followIndy PoliticsBrexit debate: Britain facing \u0027state of emergency\u0027 if no deal reached, Dominic Grieve warnsBritain will face a “state of emergency” if no Brexit deal is reached by February, Dominic Grieve has warned\u0026nbspat an exclusive event for Independent subscribers.Appearing on a stage with other key Brexit figures, including Jacob Rees-Mogg and Gina Miller, the leading Tory rebel said “ordinary life will grind to a halt” if the talks are still deadlocked as D-Day nears.The warning came as Mr Rees-Mogg launched his most outspoken attack yet on big businesses opposing a hard Brexit, claiming they have “got everything wrong in the whole of their history”.Andrea Leadsom, the Commons leader, suggested she would not accept any further “compromises”\u0026nbspbeyond the deal struck at Chequers by Theresa May – preferring a no-deal outcome.And, at the event in central London, Labour’s Chuka Umunna urged his party not to “lie to our voters” by claiming that leaving the EU could ease concerns in immigration, when a “different model of capitalism” was needed.The one-time leadership candidate also appeared to have ruled himself out of a future race, with Labour in Jeremy Corbyn’s iron grip, saying: “I’m not sure the Labour party would have me to be quite frank!”Last month, Mr Grieve, a former attorney general, led an aborted revolt to guarantee MPs a “meaningful vote” to prevent Britain crashing out of the EU without an agreement.In his most dramatic language yet, to underline the high stakes, Mr Grieve told the audience: “If by the end of February or early March\u0026nbspit is clear that there is no deal on anything, there will be a declaration of a state of emergency in this country.“Actually, ordinary life will grind to a halt. That is the extent to which our lives are intermeshed with the lives of our European partners, and that is what will happen if there is no deal on anything.”Mr Grieve said hardline anti-Brexit MPs had “abdicated” their responsibilities to the public\u0026nbspby boasting that they will do “absolutely nothing while we skated off the edge of the cliff into this major national crisis”.“That is the madness that has crept into some of the discourse in parliament,” he added.Meanwhile, Ms Leadsom refused to be drawn on whether she had contemplating resigning over the Chequers plan – as Boris Johnson and David Davis later did.“I won’t comment on what happened at Chequers – that was a cabinet meeting,” the Commons leader said.But\u0026nbsphinting any further concessions would be unacceptable, she said: “I will be looking at whether our red lines have been breached.”Insisting what was important was that the EU knew the no-deal threat was real, Ms Leadsom said: “We will be prepared to consider leaving without a deal.”Meanwhile, Mr Rees-Mogg attacked “vested interests” that were colouring the views of big businesses that wanted to protect themselves from tariffs on their goods.Brexit: 10 of the most ridiculous headlinesThis wholly false headline merited the first ruling by IPSO (the press regulator) under clause 1 of the revised Editor\u0027s Code of Practice.

Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspMr Afwerki then travelled across the capital in a large motorcade as people wearing T-shirts with photos of the two leaders cheered. The leaders later met one-on-one, with a smiling Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspleaning towards\u0026nbspMr Afwerki under a wall hung with their portraits.The visit comes a month after Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspsurprised people by fully accepting a peace deal that ended a two-year border war between the two countries. Ethiopia and Eritrea have not had diplomatic ties since the war began in 1998, with Mr Ahmed\u0026nbsphimself fighting in a town that remains contested today, and the countries have skirmished since then in one of Africa’s longest-running conflicts.Mr Ahmed’s chief of staff, Fitsum Arega, said on Twitter that the visit aims to “further deepen efforts to bring about lasting peace.” He shared photos of the leaders’ meeting and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas “very warmly received” by Mr Afwerki.“Our two nations share a history and bond like no other,” he said. “We can now overcome two decades of mistrust and move in a new direction.”Ethiopia’s foreign ministry called the visit “part of efforts to normalise relations with Eritrea” and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas expected to talk with Eritrea’s leadership about “how to mend fences”.One Eritrean diplomat, its ambassador to Japan Estifanos Afeworki, said on Twitter that “no leader has received such a warm welcome like today in Asmara in the history of Eritrea”.Ethiopians expressed welcome shock at the meeting, which was shown live by Ethiopia’s state TV.“Historic ... the beginning of the end. The glass ceiling has been broken,” one resident, Shewit Wudassie, wrote on Facebook. Another Facebook user, Djphat Su, wrote: “Am I dreaming or what?”The decision to fully accept the peace deal was the biggest and most surprising reform yet announced by Ethiopia’s 42-year-old prime minister, who took office in April and quickly set off a wave of reforms, freeing journalists and opposition figures from prison, opening up the state-run economy and unblocking hundreds of websites after years of anti-government protests demanding more freedoms.World news in picturesUS President Donald Trump and Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg attend a bilateral breakfast ahead of the NATO Summit in BrusselsThe last four Thai Navy SEALs come out safely after completing the rescue mission inside a cave where 12 boys and their soccer coach have been trapped since June 23, in Mae Sai, Chiang Rai province, northern Thailand.

Frontex runs an operation off the coast of Italy that works closely with the local coast guard.The EU missions have helped rescue thousands of refugees\u0026nbspat sea, all of whom were disembarked in Italy. Spokespeople at Frontex and Sophia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Italy has so far refused to take back any migrants stopped at the German border.“Before receiving even one asylum seeker from another European country, we want to see a precise commitment – giving the timetable, costs, means, men and resources –\u0026nbspon how the EU plans to help us defend our external borders,” Mr Salvini said last week.Aid groups and United Nations’ agencies on Friday asked Italy open its ports to rescue ships because the policy could have a high human cost. More migrants could die at sea, or they could be trapped indefinitely in inhumane detention centres, they said.On Sunday, Mr Salvini said the previous government had agreed to welcome migrants rescued by ships participating in the EU sea missions.Mr Salvini said: “With our government, the music has changed and will change”.This comes after a rescue boat carrying 60 refugees arrived in Barcelona last week after being turned away by Italy and Malta.The mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, came to the ship’s rescue when she, with permission from the Spanish government, told the crew of the vessel that it could dock.\u0026nbspThe boat, which was said to have had five women, a nine-year-old and four teenagers on board, was turned away by Mr Salvini.He said the rescue boat “can forget about arriving in an Italian port” and then suggested the boat should dock in Malta which he claimed was the nearest port.Additional reporting by ReutersEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

All French parties are entitled to money in proportion to the number of votes it receives.The party, which recently changed its name from National Front to National Rally in an attempt to distance itself from racist and antisemitic associations, has long suffered from financial problems.In 2014 it took a loan from a Russian bank, saying it had been refused credit in France.

Of course, our security interests don’t begin and end at our borders, or even at the edge of Europe.Whether it’s Russia, Syria, Afghanistan or beyond, threats continue to emerge and develop around the world.After we leave the EU we will be free to pursue a truly independent foreign policy but that does not mean we will isolate ourselves from our neighbours.Under our proposals, we will continue to consult and co-operate with our EU partners on global issues.We will work with the EU on sanctions like those recently imposed on Russia, including co-ordinating them where it’s in our interests to do so.Our joint work on defence capability and space will continue. And we will decide where our armed forces and foreign aid could be used alongside the EU.Brexit has never been about turning our backs on Europe, pulling down the shutters and keeping ourselves to ourselves.Since well before the EU existed we have traded with and fought alongside allies around the world, and that won’t end when we leave next March.There’s still a lot of negotiating to be done. But our ambitious, effective proposal for a smooth customs arrangement and continued security co-operation is a huge step forward.It’s a good deal for Europe, and a good deal for Britain.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The shore is lined with hostile Remainers. As for the voters — the 17.4million “thick and ignorant racists” who backed Brexit in 2016 — who cares about them?Britain is now offering a peace deal to Brussels which, however we gloss it over, stinks of surrender.To quote Boris Johnson, who backed it: “You can’t polish a turd.”This is not a White Paper. It is a White Flag.We will have a “Common Rule Book” — written by the EU and imposed by the European Court of Justice.These rules will torpedo any trade deal outside the EU. Immigration continues under a scheme which by any other name means free movement.This is not even Brexit In Name Only. It is zombie EU membership — and the UK is the zombie with no say in rule-making and paying through the nose for rule-taking.Of course, we need to be realistic. Compromises are inevitable since we made no plans for No Deal.Thanks to Mrs May’s election horror, the sums do not add up for Brexit. Remainers rule in the Tory Party, the House of Commons and the Lords.Without a heavyweight leader, Brexit Tories know they cannot raise the numbers to oust Mrs May. A failed challenge would only boost her new-found confidence and authority.Michael Gove and others argue a future Brexit Prime Minister — Mr Gove, for instance — could finish the job once we are legally Out.In fact, Britain tends to keep its treaty ­promises.We can’t even count on EU bully Michel Barnier to stir up a revolt. He and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will probably accept Mrs May’s deal, with a few tweaks, because they are effectively its co-authors.The Rule Book will keep us in line — no ­separate trade deals, no sovereign control over our borders, no escaping the ECJ.Brexit Cabinet ministers must accept some of the blame. They failed to force Mrs May when they had a chance to prepare for a No Deal Brexit. That failure instantly handed victory to the Remainers and to Brussels.Should we one day choose to make a clean break, we will face harsh “consequences” — what Boris vividly calls “punishment beatings”.But the biggest punishment beating will come from voters.If the Tories don’t care about the 17.4million who want Brexit, they will be made to care.Constitutional lawyer Martin Howe, a Tory QC, warns we are entering “a worst-of-all-worlds black hole Brexit where Britain is stuck ­permanently as a vassal state.”The fragile Tory lead over Labour has just evaporated. Almost 40 per cent of voters think the PM has betrayed the 2016 referendum result.Tories might not switch directly to Labour, but they won’t forget. If only a small percentage sit out the next Election, Jezza will be our first Marxist PM.Michael Gove and Home Secretary Sajid Javid tried to put a shine on a deal they claim is the “best available”.And they didn’t even have the decency to hold their noses.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are highly doubtful but we hope he’s right.To us, a proper Brexit, which would have made us a freer, richer country and was backed by a 17.4 million majority, has been given up without a fight.Remainer Tories MUST study the polls showing their party could now face an election wipeout as their core voters desert them. Their sliding ratings will go into freefall if they vote alongside Labour this month to keep us in an EU customs union ­— a total negation of Brexit.If Brexit is further watered down to meaninglessness, the Tories are finished.MICHAEL Fallon is right to try to stop ­taxpayers’ cash being used to reopen cases from the Troubles.Our ageing veterans live in fear of arrest for difficult decisions taken decades ago in a war zone.This witch-hunt MUST end.OUR boys’ World Cup success is set to cause a baby boom as randy fans celebrate by romping.If the Three Lions deliver us the World Cup there will be a BOOM in certain names, too.Expect some Harrys and Gareths.

Hunt refused to be shunted aside and ultimately secured the promise of another £20billion a year in NHS cash. He has earned a promotion.His replacement Matt Hancock has an enormous brief to learn rapidly — but he too is highly capable.And Leave-backing Dominic Raab could make a terrific, energetic Brexit Secretary if Mrs May lets him.

But in practice, how does that work given that most sexual encounters are one-on-one with no witnesses?She can still say yes at the time then later pretend she didn’t and falsely accuse him of rape.And equally, he could pretend she had consented when, in fact, she had screamed no.Perhaps we are moving to an era when all young people will feel compelled to temporarily stall a moment of passion so they can film the consenting “yes” on their mobile phones? Or failing that, perhaps have a solicitor present.ACTRESS Paula Williamson wed “Britain’s most violent prisoner” Charles Bronson last November and said she looked forward to him getting out so they could enjoy a normal marriage.Yet just two months later he allegedly attacked the deputy governor of HMP Wakefield and now, just before appearing via video link at Leeds magistrates court, he tried to take his guards hostage in his cell.Hmmmm. Something tells me that – after spending 42 years inside – 65-year-old Charlie boy has become institutionalised and doesn’t actually want to come out, hence the litany of violent episodes that keep him in trouble and constantly embarrass his trusting wife.It gives a whole new meaning to the term blushing bride.NEW research shows that the ability to ward off fear and unhappiness is a skill that improves markedly with age.An American neuroscientist says the reaction of the old and the young to, say, the imminent results of an election were significantly different.That’s because, when you’ve seen a few governments come and go, we of a certain age eventually realise they’re all as useless as each other and whatever we say or do to try to change that has no effect at all.But if it turns out to be a France v England final, I may be heading home sooner than expected.FORMER Radio 1 DJ “Diddy” David Hamilton has weighed in to the #MeToo debate with his recollection of his Seventies heyday, saying: “We didn’t go around forcing ourselves on women.“It sounds conceited to say it but we didn’t have to because a lot of women were forcing themselves on us.”Meanwhile, Kinks frontman Sir Ray Davies reveals: “A world-famous groupie once threw me out because I was too kind.”A reminder, if needed, that not all men are b******s and not all women are innocent victims.And if further proof is required, look no further than some of the predatory females stalking their male prey on Love Island each night.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We used it as a second home but decided to make it our main home when we retired and thought we would modernise and extend it.We had worked with an architect called Stan Bolt on a house we had in Salcombe and that was a very good experience so we went to him again.But hes a modern architect and this was a cottage. We wanted to keep the cottage as it has a lot of local history and its emotionally important to us.It would have been much easier to knock it down and build something new, but we didnt want to do that and Stan didnt either.It gave us more space for the kids and grandchildren to stay and it works well as a home, the old flows very well into the new.The area has a great atmosphere, its a lovely place to live. There are no near neighbours but its only a ten minute walk into Great Bedwyn and you can get from there to Paddington station in 71 minutes.Well be sad to see it go but life moves on.Mirldown House now has 2,908 sq ft of accommodation with an entrance hall, kitchen/breakfast room, sitting room, drawing room, dining room, study, five bedrooms and three bathrooms.There is also a garage with a workshop and store room and the gardens extend to 2.68 acres with lawns, mature trees and hedging.It has a tennis court tucked away at the side and a Grade II listed kiln in the grounds.The house is on the edge of the popular village of Great Bedwyn, which has a thriving local community and is easily commutable to London.The village is surrounded on all sides by beautiful rolling countryside and lies on the edge of Savernake Forest. The Kennet \u0026amp Avon Canal runs through the middle and the area is very popular for walking and riding."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict0003560299321.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"559\" width=\"960","title":"ministers plan to float thousands of generators in the irish sea in case of no deal brexit to make sure northern ireland doesnt lose power","story":"Thousands of electricity generators could have to be dragged back from places as far away as Afghanistan if talks break down, because of an old agreement with the Republic of Ireland.Private Government documents revealed that leaving the EU with no deal would put into doubt energy on the island of Ireland, the Financial Times revealed.At the moment, the North shares an energy market with the Republic, thanks to the Good Friday Agreement signed in 1998.And ministers hope that can continue after we leave.But if there were no deal, the Republic could cut off power to the north because it would not be part of the European market.In that case, Britain would have to scramble together thousands of generators to prevent blackouts - many of which are being used around the world.A Government spokesperson confirmed the reports, and told the paper: We are working hard on a solution.As a responsible government, we will continue to prepare for all scenarios, including the highly unlikely outcome that we leave the EU without any deal next March, the spokesman added.Ministers have said Britain must step up its preparations for no-deal Brexit as negotiations with the EU continue to run into roadblocks.The Sun revealed today that secret plans have been drawn up to stockpile foods in the event of EU divorce talks collapsing - to show Brussels that no deal is not a bluff.That includes emergency measures to keep Britain’s massive food and drinks industry afloat - including stockpiling ahead of exit day on 29 March next year.More than £22 billion worth of processed food and drinks are imported in to the UK - 97 per cent from the EU - in an industry that keeps 400,000 workers employed in the UK.Similar stockpiles are also being prepared for medical supplies amid fears of chaos at British ports next year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Will we be able to sign our own trade deals? And will the UK be outside the jurisdiction of the European Court?I’m very pleased to say the answers are very simple: yes, yes and yes.First, it will mean a genuine end to freedom of movement.No longer will people be allowed to arrive here from across Europe on the off-chance that they might find a job.We will always welcome the skilled professionals who help our country thrive, from doctors and nurses to engineers and entrepreneurs but for the first time in decades, we will have full control of our borders.And it will be the UK, not Brussels, that decides who should be allowed to live and work here.Second, we will have our own completely independent trade policy, our own seat at the World Trade Organisation and the ability to set tariffs and strike trade deals with whoever we please.British goods and services are in huge demand internationally, so it’s no surprise that countries are queuing up to make trade deals with us after we leave the EU.We are having good discussions with countries we would aim to sign trade deals with, including the US, as I will discuss with President Trump when he arrives in the UK on Thursday.Third, our plan will take back control of our laws.We will no longer be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union, instead, British judges in British courts will rule on our laws.And while we will commit to have common rules with the EU on things like exhaust emissions and food safety, Parliament will have to agree these rules.Put simply, such EU rules will no longer automatically and directly apply in the UK — Parliament will have a say.It’s clear to me that this is the right Brexit deal for Britain, although there are, of course, some alternatives.The EU’s preferred option — a standard, off-the-shelf trade deal for Great Britain with Northern Ireland in the customs union and parts of the single market — would break up our country.The other option the EU suggests, a combination of EEA membership with continued membership of the customs union, would not be Brexit at all.We would have no control over immigration, no ability to strike our own trade deals, and would still be liable for vast annual payments to Brussels.And while we must prepare for the possibility of leaving without a deal, I’m clear that the best outcome — for both the UK and the EU — is a deal based on the ideas we are setting out on Thursday.As for Labour, they are opening the door to a second referendum — ignoring the decision taken by the country and making it harder to get a good deal.Only our Brexit deal for Britain truly respects the will of the British people.And, as Prime Minister, it is the Brexit I am determined to deliver.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sometimes that’s the only way to sort stuff out.That’s what the US President Donald Trump is doing right now with his Nato allies. And it’s a mighty big sledgehammer.In the firing line is Angela Merkel, of Germany. And the other countries that are backsliding on their commitment to the civilised world’s safety and security.Trump thinks — and he’s right — that for far too long Europe and Canada have not been paying their share for our military defence. The Germans pay nowhere near enough. But even worse are the Belgians.Incredibly, Canada, led by that simpering idiot Justin Trudeau, spends scarcely more than one per cent of its GDP on defence. One of the richest countries on the world. The Spanish, as you might expect, pay four fifths of sod all. LESS than one per cent.Trump is telling them all they cannot depend on America any more. The US spends 3.5 per cent of its enormous GDP on the military. Much more than any other country in Nato.And as a consequence, Western Europe (and Canada) has been safe for decades. It was US military spending which led to the end of the Cold War and ultimately the break up of the “evil empire”, the Soviet Union.So where do we stand in all this? We spend more per head than our European partners, Estonia and Greece excepted. But still just the bare minimum of two per cent of GDP.And for years now we’ve been reducing our defence budgets. Cutting our armed services to the bone. Take the Royal Navy. In the 36 years since the Falklands War the number of warships we possess has reduced by a staggering 74 per cent.We now have a Navy which is 25 per cent smaller than it was in 1650 — when we had only a tenth of our current population. We were once a great maritime power. Today we’d do well to win a naval battle against Luxembourg — and that’s landlocked.Military spending does not create wars. It does the opposite. It makes them much, much less likely.The Falklands War against Argentina occurred because we had cut our spending on the Navy to the point where we no longer defended the far-flung islands. The Argies saw their chance and invaded.Luckily we still had a big enough Navy to respond and win back the freedom for the Falklanders. We couldn’t even dream of doing the same thing now.Meanwhile, the RAF has seen its number of combat aircraft cut by more than one third in less than ten years. We now have just 149. You probably saw them during the flypast on Tuesday, if you live in London. That was the lot. That’s it.The first duty of any government is to protect its citizens. The US does that and we should do so, too — never mind the backsliding Europeans.The world is no less of a dangerous place than it was 30 or 60 years ago. Trump has got this absolutely right.NAZ SHAH is a Labour MP. Not so long ago she was suspended from the party.She had agreed with the foul and offensive idea that Israel should be “relocated” to the USA.Shah also compared the Israeli government to Adolf Hitler. Now she’s back in the party – and guess what? She’s been given a front bench role. As shadow equalities minister!They certainly take anti-Semitism seriously in Corbyn’s Labour Party. Surely there cannot be any Jewish people left in the country who would vote for this racist rabble.I’VE seen many remarkable things in my life. I’ve watched my team, Millwall, play in an FA Cup Final.I’ve seen the sun set at lunchtime in the Arctic Circle. I’ve talked to Arab terrorists, American presidents and famous pop singers. But there’s one thing I’ve never done.I have never, ever, in my entire life, met anyone who liked Danny Dyer. I was at party last week with people from all walks of life, and Danny’s name came up.The reaction was immediate. “Oh Christ, not that d**k . . .I think one woman even went behind a bush to be sick. Anyway, just thought I’d mention that.Maybe one day I will meet someone who likes Danny Dyer. And my life will be complete.IMPORTANT news story. Emily Ratajkowski is on holiday.We know this because she has very kindly sent the world some photographs of her break.But I will make sure to send back to The Sun some snaps of me lying on a sunbed with my a*se in the air, or posing in something alluring by a pool with a big pout on my chops. Enjoy.The EUS chief negotiator, Michel barnier wit Jeane-Claude Juncker - and the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel.And that, frankly, is all you need to knowBEST news of the week, maybe of the year, was the heroic rescue of those young Thai kids from a flooded cave complex.It was an enormous, dangerous and brilliantly executed plan to get them out.And now, guess what? Hollywood is going to make a film about it all.YOU know the score, I don’t.All of my Wednesday is spent in a state of mental torture.What if we don’t crock Modric early on? When’s Harry going to start scoring again?I know the World Cup has been great fun. But does anybody actually ENJOY watching England – unless they’re 3-0 up? It’s too terrifying.Anyway, apparently there is a sharp rise in the birth rate when England win important football matches.Blokes take to their beds filled with passion.Me too, as it happens. And I like to relive the match by providing a loud commentary, in the manner of Jonathan Pearce, while I’m on the job.“Oh, just look at Liddle! He’s found a way through – AND IT’S IN!”ITALY has just turned away another ship full of migrants. It had been chartered by one of the many leftie charities bobbing about in the Med.Isn’t it time these mor- ons were prosecuted for people trafficking? Migrants now set off expecting to be picked up.

So he had gagged me with a condom.I was too young, thank God, to know what a condom tasted like. It was so inappropriate. And what the heck was a casting director doing with a condom in his pocket?Sorvino was one of the first actresses to go public with allegations against Weinstein.In the New Yorker magazine in October last year, she said that Weinstein had chased her around a room after he started massaging her shoulders in a Toronto hotel in 1995.Following the flood of allegations against Weinstein, Lord Of The Rings director Sir Peter Jackson revealed the producer had waged a smear campaign against the actress after she rejected his advances.Weinstein told the filmmaker Sorvino was a nightmare to work with, leading to her name being taken off his casting list.In December, Sorvino, who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Woody Allen’s 1995 comedy Mighty Aphrodite, said she burst out crying after reading Sir Peters revelations.She said: There it is, confirmation that Harvey Weinstein derailed my career, something I suspected but was unsure. Thank you Peter Jackson for being honest.

No one should be subjected to flogging.That a child was prosecuted for consuming alcohol and sentenced to 80 lashes beggars belief.Amnesty found out the man, identified only as M R, consumed alcohol during a wedding in around March 2007.The Public Prosecutor of Kashmar said an argument at the same event resulted in a 17-year-old being killed.He conceded that MR was not involved in the death and his punishment was for drinking only.His flogging sentence was also issued 10 years ago in 1386, somewhere between March 2007 and 2008.Iranian officials have carried out various forms of cruel punishments in 2018, including amputating a mans hand for stealing.Mr Luther said: The use of cruel punishments such as flogging, amputation and blinding are an appalling assault on human dignity.Its unacceptable Iranian authorities allow such punishments and to justify them in the name of protecting religious morals.In November 2016, an Iranian woman revealed the horrible injuries she suffered at the hands of authorities for drinking.The 28-year-old woman also received 80 lashes after she was caught attending a party with boys and drinking alcohol.An Iranian court found her guilty of the offences more than two years after she attended the party in the second biggest city of Mashhad."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000419687958.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mysteries of the worlds ancient abandoned civilisations revealed in stunning pics","story":"They show citadels overgrown by jungle, statues lying half-hidden in the sand and gigantic bizarre sculptures carved into rock faces.All of these ruins were left behind after the inhabiting civilisations were abandoned following natural disasters, religious conflict and even shifting patterns of trade.Their fascinating stories have been revealed in a new book called Abandoned Civilisations, detailing how vast societies can rise and fall.Among them is Masada, an ancient mountaintop in Israel used in an ancient battle between Jews and Romans.Another shows the lost ruins of Petra - discovered deep within the Jordanian desert by an explorer in the early 1800s."},{"url":null,"title":"the big singalong flop","story":"Instead, it’s left to the commercial broadcaster and poor old Tony Hadley, reaching something close to climax, to sing a hymn of praise to this much-neglected national treasure.At which point, I think it’s probably time to drop the laboured sarcasm, because this next event may have been the point the cult of the NHS met its Waterloo.The Big Singalong Live, from Abbey Road Studios, where the disclaimers were heavier than Wednesday night’s rain as host Sara Cox quickly established: “This was not our idea, was it, Ashley (Banjo)?”“No, no it wasn’t.”The buck was being passed very much in the direction of the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS choir, who had come up with the perfectly ­reasonable idea of breaking television’s singalong record of 6,904 people, with a live version of The Beatles’ song With A Little Help From My Friends.Tireless and talented NHS heroes they may be, but for this thing to fly someone also clearly felt the process required some famous names to get on board.Normally, of course, this is the point when the public realises, “Ah, so it isn’t about us or the NHS at all. It’s about celebrities improving their image.”Oh, but what record-breaking names they’d assembled.Robbie, Adele, Elton, Ed Sheeran, Coldplay and Stormzy, were just a few of those who didn’t attend.Blue, Coleen Nolan, Amber Davies, from last year’s Love Island, UB40, Kimberley Walsh and Tony Hadley, on the other hand, were all involved, as was JLS’s Aston Merrygold, right, who said, on behalf of the NHS, he was: “Happy to clear my diary.”So we thank him and whoever covered the shift at Domino’s.Job demarcation, though, among the celebs, was a bit vague. A few just seemed to have backing track duties, like Kimberley Walsh who was given the line “What would you do if I sang out of tune?” (IF?)Some were enrolled for the full, record-breaking, Abbey Road finale, while others went on recruitment drives at UK hospitals, where Tony unearthed “the singing ambulanceman”, and Sara set her sights on Debbie “who’s pouring custard on a spotted Dick” — in the staff canteen, rather than the Infectious Diseases Unit.Eulogies to the great NHS god, though, were compulsory and delivered with a glassy-eyed, lip-quivering intensity that has become a very familiar sight these past few months.Good intentions, as we know, though, pave the road to hell. And so it proved with Wednesday’s Big Singalong Live, which kicked off with a parp of a klaxon, from Ashley, and Sara screaming: “Can we now please break that record.”Perhaps we can put what followed down to the swirling p***storm, in North London, or the lack of practice time — they only had six weeks — but, dear Lord in heaven — Russell Crowe didn’t unleash this much hell in Gladiator.Missed cues, frozen screens, flat voices, Tony Hadley giving it the big ’un, on the Abbey Road zebra crossing, with his “woh-oh ohhhs”.Seven thousand drunk Millwall fans chanting: “You’re going home in a London ambulance” could not have been much less unco-ordinated, but would undoubtedly have delivered an equally powerful message about the NHS.Salvation, though, was on hand in the form of Sara Cox.“The results are in and . . . (drum roll).“We almost made it, but it looks like the weather may have rained on our parade. We didn’t break the record.” A MASTERCLASS in scheduling, editing and continuity, from Channel 5, on Thursday night, that began with the very chirpy announcement: “We’ll find out What Happened to Josef Fritzl after brand new Nando’s, A PERi PERi Big Success . . . ”Which isn’t the first thing I associate Josef with, to be perfectly honest with you.

The US President has been ripping up the diplomatic rulebook across the globe as he pulls America out of the rules-based international order. But there have been lighter moments in Brussels too. Here are the five biggest things we\u0027ve learned from the NATO summit so far: 1. Donald Trump carries out campaign pledges  Arriving in Brussels, the President held talks with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the US Ambassador\u0027s residence.  TV cameras and a handful of journalists are routinely invited into these meetings to record “the top” - the opening remarks. Usually these are polite – boring - pleasantries as protagonists explain how pleased they are to see each other and how they are going to have a good, constructive conversation. Not Trump. Tossing convention aside, he tore into NATO, and Germany in particular, over defence spending. During his election campaign he frequently moaned about the fact the US pumps so much more into defence than its allies, and pledged to tackle NATO counterparts about the “unfairness”. As soon as he got to the Belgian capital, he did just that.  2. Angela Merkel is the Queen of the cold, hard slap down The German Chancellor, who unlike Donald Trump is not on Twitter, had three hours to think about her comeback to the President\u0027s rant about her country\u0027s defence spending. She would have been especially shocked at his claim that her country is a Russian “captive” because of its reliance on Russian gas.  Often mocked for being too serious, Frau Merkel delivered the perfect response. Recalling her childhood in East Germany, she said: I have experienced myself how a part of Germany was controlled by the Soviet Union. I am very happy that today we are united in freedom, the Federal Republic of Germany.  “Because of that we can say that we can make our independent policies and make independent decisions. “That is very good, especially for people in eastern Germany. \u0027Nuff said. 3. Theresa May can throw shade Whether she meant it or not – and let\u0027s face it, she probably didn\u0027t – the clip of her apparently inviting then snubbing a Donald Trump handshake is gold. Seemingly offering her hand to the President, as soon as he extended his she moved her arm away and guided Mr Trump towards Jeremy Hunt, the new Foreign Secretary. At a time when the President is losing friends fast around the world, the Prime Minister – possibly inspired by French leader Emmanuel Macron performing the same trick last year - did her global street cred no harm with the encounter, accidental or not. 4. Britain does better fly pasts than NATO  Honestly, the full might of the most successful military alliance in history and the best they can offer is 25 helicopters?  This poor show came exactly 24 hours after the biggest ever fly past in the UK, when 100 – yes A HUNDRED – aircraft flew up The Mall to mark the RAF\u0027s centenary. We sent Spitfires, a Lancaster bomber, Typhoons, Tornados and even F35 Lightning jets roaring across central London to the delights of thousands. NATO put on two dozen and one choppers – and despite the Mirror asking for a full breakdown of the various helicopters taking part, answer came there none. Embarrassing. 5. Even Theresa May struggles in heels occasionally  The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland regularly speaks of her love for shoes and her register of interests has previously shown discount cards for two leading footwear brands. So what follows next definitely isn\u0027t sexist.

Ceri Poulton, 31, ballooned to a size 20 by gorging on chocolate for breakfast and scoffing kebabs, crisps, chips and pizza, sending her weight rocketing to over 15st after leaving secondary school. She said: “I have always been a big girl. Throughout school I was so overweight that when the boys found out I was playing Juliet in the school play none of them wanted to play Romeo and we had to get a girl to play the role. “I was 11-years-old, in Year Six and I heard all the boys say ‘no, I’m not doing it. It was pretty embarrassing.  “Secondary school was easier for me. I used my quick wit and humour to gain popularity and my weight didn’t feel like such a big deal anymore. “I slowly gained weight through the 10 years following until I had my daughter in 2009 when I hit 15st 2.5lb. My daughter’s christening photos sent me into shock. One day I had purchased a size 20 dress from Primark because I couldn’t find anything nice in my size. At 5ft 8, I suit being a little bigger but that was beyond crazy.  “I had sunk into a pattern of eating when I was tired, using my daughter as an excuse to not exercise. “I never exercised. I ate chocolate for breakfast, and I loved kebabs, crisps, chips and pizza – all the bad carbs! “I wanted to change. My mum was unfit and overweight and as much as I adored her, I wanted something different for my own daughter. I wanted her to be healthy.  After the birth of her daughter and her mum’s terminal cancer diagnosis Ceri decided to turn her life around and embraced a healthy lifestyle. She lost more than four stone, started to exercise, retrained professionally and landed her dream job at a hospital where she met her ‘soulmate’. “I never thought anyone would want to marry me but now I’m planning my dream wedding with my perfect partner and I’m so happy, said Ceri.  Her real life Romeo, Lewis, an electrician, strode into her life one day to fix a fan in the office. “At first I thought he was grumpy but then I noticed that he was very good looking. So I glanced at his name badge and looked him up on Facebook. “I messaged him and said I thought he was very good looking, and embarrassingly he asked who I was. After a few messages I asked him out on a date and he said he’d think about it! “Then the next week he messaged me back and said he’d love to go on a date.  Recalling their first date together, Ceri said: We went to a country pub. We sat by the fire and chatted over a drink, it was amazing. When we were leaving he asked if I’d walk with him to the boot of his car. I wondered if he was going to murder me and stuff me in it! But when he opened it there was a huge bunch of flowers which he gave to me. “He told my daughter, Jasmine, months before he proposed that he was going to ask me to marry him. We’re so close it was torture for her not to tell me. Every time we passed a place she knew I wanted to get married in she’d say ‘Mummy, there’s something I really want to tell you but I can’t.’ “So I had an inkling that he might be thinking about it. Then we went on holiday together and I was sure he would ask me then. I made sure I looked proper nice every day but nothing happened. When we got home from the airport I was devastated. “Then weeks later we went to a restaurant in Dartmoor to celebrate our third year anniversary. When we got back we sat in the car for a while just chatting and enjoying the peace.  “He asked me to get him something from the glove compartment and there was a ring. He said ‘Ceri Poulton, will you marry me?’ “And I said ‘yes’ immediately before he could change his mind! “He really is amazing. If I die tomorrow I’ll die happy knowing that my daughter is well cared for. The couple will tie the knot surrounded by family and friends in a Christmas ceremony in November next year. I’ve been dress shopping but I haven’t decided exactly what I want yet. I tried on really tight fitting dresses which looked amazing but I love dancing and eating so I think I’ll go for something less restrictive like a princess style in the end.” Ceri\u0027s fairytale ending comes after months of hard work and determination to lose weight.  “In 2009 I saw a billboard outside the local church which advertised a Slimming World class. I decided to go and check it out and I’ve never looked back. “I steadily lost weight over the next two years, just by changing the way I was cooking, walking more and treating myself once a week after weigh-in so I wasn’t missing out.” Ceri found Slimming World a hugely supportive environment and the more targets she hit, the more she wanted to smash the next weight-loss goal. “Losing the first stone was slow. I still treated myself a lot and wasn’t really that bothered about it. But once I lost the first stone I realized I really wanted this.”  “By November 2012 I was crowned Slimming World Miss Slinky 2012 for my slimming group and reached my 4stone award. “Before this I couldn’t swim and I never really ran but now I take part in charity runs and swimathons – even though that means doggy-paddling through all those miles of water. “You only have one life and you’ve got to make the best of it.” Ceri has maintained her 4stone weight loss and almost won Slimming World’s Biggest Loser award – the most challenging one there is recently. I cried when I didn’t make it but maybe next year I’ll get it, she said. “I am currently trying to reach my 4.5st award in time for my wedding but after being at target for six years it is very difficult! I never allow myself to get wrapped up in dieting, I live my life and I love it. “Now I work out hard, my week consists of running, weights and three body balance classes a week. “I challenge my work friends to Race At Your Pace cycling and running challenges and I am constantly increasing my medal collection.  “I have about 15 medals from charity runs, I bought a medal holder for them which is in my room and every time I see it it motivates me to win more. “In 2016 I zip lined across Bournemouth Pier and drove Segways around Prague, things I never would have done before. “My daughter chooses salad and fruit over crisps and chocolate and she knows that in order to have a large treat we have to go for long walks or swim.

If you want to get a bear for your five-year-old child, you\u0027ll pay just \u0026pound5. If you\u0027re 25 years old, it\u0027ll cost you \u0026pound25. All bears are included in the deal and the minimum price for this offer is \u0026pound1 (even for those younger than a year old). But now stores are turning away customers because the demand is so high it has led to \u0027safety concerns\u0027 - with the police even reportedly called to some shops.  Are you stuck in a Build-a-Bear queue? Email webnews@mirror  Stores in Telford, Shropshire, Basingstoke, Hampshire and Sheffield, were forced to shut early amid safety fears.  One mum was refused entrance when she tried to join the queue at the Build-a-Bear store in Meadowhall, Sheffield, despite arriving before the shop opened. She said: “We arrived around 9.45am, about 15 minutes before it was due to open. “The line was almost full length of one side of the shopping centre. “A member of staff told us to go home as we couldn’t join the line and it was up to a nine hour wait for people already waiting.” Devon Live is reporting that staff members are \u0027exhausted\u0027 as they did not anticipate it being so busy.      The store say demand has been \u0027unprecedented\u0027 leading to huge queues and even some reports of violence. Fiona O\u0027Reilly, 31, from Gateshead, arrived at the  Centre at 8.15am today in order to purchase bears for each of her four children. She was shocked by the hundreds of parents already queuing before the shop opened at 10am and feared there could be fights as parents argued in the queues. She said: It was complete madness I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if there were a few riots over this today. I managed to get there early and it took just over an hour for me to get all four bears. However, the queues are starting to get so long, and the store only has four staff making the bears, so I reckon people will be waiting all day. There\u0027s already people fighting in the queues!  Mum Kimberley Gray, 24, from Cardiff, said it would be worth the wait for her three-year-old daughter Lilly. It will be worth it because she\u0027ll be so happy, she said. Dawn Collard, 52, from Barry queued at the Cardiff store with seven children. Two are her grandchildren and the others are children she looks after as she is a childminder. She said: “I think it’s amazing. My bill should have been \u0026pound150 but I only paid \u0026pound27. I bought them for all the kids. They absolutely loved it.  Queues started building outside stores early and have now ballooned to such a scale some stores are telling customers not to join. One shopper, who didn’t want to be named, told Essex Live: “It’s so busy, the whole of the centre outside Mark and Spencer is queueing like a snake back and forth, pushchairs and children everywhere.  The Lakeside staff have said that the people at the front of the queue have been there since 8am. Huge crowds have gathered outside the store in Maidstone and a queue with an estimated four hour waiting time is zig zagging down the high street, with the end reaching as far as Card Factory, as parents desperately try to nab a bargain for their child.    Mum Leonnie Braker was lucky enough to nab an early place in the queue at the Greenhithe shopping centre, and her one-year-old twins escaped with Star Wars themed bears. She told Kent Live:  I\u0027m pleased. Wouldn\u0027t have bothered if I\u0027d got there later. Just heard they only have 1800 bears and there are 1000 at least in queue and people have more than one kid with them.     Kate Lowe said: We got to Build-A-Bear at Intu Derby before 9am for Pay Your Age Day and there was a four-hour queue! I couldn\u0027t even see the end of it! We got donuts and went home. A parent, who didn’t want to be named, said: “We got here at 9am, three hours we’ve been queuing for and we’ve just reached the door to the shop. It’ll all be worth it when we see the children\u0027s faces though.”  Nick Scully, manager of the store told Derbyshire Live the store has sold several hundred bears.  In Hull security staff took control and erected barriers to control the queues before refusing to let anyone else join and giving vouchers out that entitled the families to \u0026pound12 off their next bought item at the store. Staff said they thought around 500 people were queuing for the bears. A huge queuing is spiralling inside Manchester Arndale, which Rebecca Robinson has joined with her daughter Sophia. She said: I reckon there\u0027s around 1,000 people at least. I got told at Bristol there’s over 2,000 people waiting. They\u0027ve stopped people queuing for now because there are too many. Sharon Price John, president and chief executive officer of Build-A-Bear Workshop, said:  We have overwhelming data that indicates Build-A-Bear is synonymous with childhood, and nearly one-third of our sales are associated with birthdays. “We ‘heart’ birthdays at Build-A-Bear, so we’re hosting the Pay Your Age Day to launch our year-round ‘Count Your Candles’ offer for guests celebrating a birthday with us in stores - an experience we designed especially to commemorate birthdays in a memorable way.”  "},{"url":null,"title":"dejected england fans leave sea","story":"NewsDejected England fans leave a sea of debris after heartbreaking Croatia defeat - but some stay behind to clear up their emptiesFootball fans were devastated after England crashed out of the World Cup with a 2-1 defeat to Croatia\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByElaine McCahill00:29, 12 JUL 2018Updated08:42, 12 JUL 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailEngland fans were left devastated after the World Cup dream ended with a 2-1 defeat to Croatia.

Disorder was reported across the UK, with large fights in Liverpool, Birmingham and Hull caught on camera, and groups attacking police in London. Emergency services reported a huge volume of calls as fans vented their frustration after England crashed out of the competition. Men and women are seen throwing punches in a clip taken in Birmingham last night as a fight broke out despite police appeals for calm. And football fans were seen diving into canals and climbing lampposts in Britain\u0027s second city, the Birmingham Mail reports. Did you see any trouble after last night\u0027s game? Email webnews@trinitymirror  In London a senior police officer said a group had attempted to attack him and a colleague in Shoreditch while they were giving first aid. City of London Police Superintendent Billy Duffy posted on Twitter: Disappointed by a small group within the crowd who wanted to provoke / intimidate / attack me + colleague when we were alone + attempting to administer first aid. The London Ambulance Service said it was called to 300 incidents per hour in the aftermath of the game.   One 999 call was made for someone who had climbed - and fallen from - a lamppost. West Midlands Ambulance Service said that in the hour following the close of play, it had taken almost 240 999 calls compared to 120 in the hour before.     In Liverpool, angry fans threw bottles and trays inside a pub in St Helens, the Liverpool Echo reports. The Gerard Arms pub later released a statement blasting mindless thuggery, saying the World Cup had been peaceful up to that point. It said: What we cannot plan for is one case of sporadic mindless thuggery. Unfortunately a fight broke out as England were knocked out and we immediately closed the bar and we tried our best to contain the incident.  Police also had to break up a large brawl in Hull as tempers ran high, the Hull Daily Mail revealed.

How to cure a bad hangover - fast and quick cures from best foods to science-approved tricks  Humberside Police and door staff had to break up a brawl in Hull which broke out during the match. BBC reporter David Harrison caught this picture from the police’s Silver Command suite in Hull.    Punches were being thrown as tempers flared after Croatia equalised against England, which ultimately led to their victory and Three Lion’s defeat. In Nottingham, where a taxi was smashed up after the 2-0 quarter-final victory against Sweden, more officers were drafted in - and some rest days cancelled - to quell any disorder. Steve Cooper, who led the policing operation, said: We have made two arrests for domestic abuse-related offences, but the levels of criminal damage, disorder and antisocial behaviour that we saw on the weekend have not been repeated.  People have been really cooperative and patient while we closed a number of roads in the city centre to move on the crowds of people leaving Nottingham Castle and have made their way under instruction of uniformed colleagues. The National Police Chiefs\u0027 Council (NPCC) said 387 football-related incidents were recorded at the weekend, mostly alcohol-related disorder. But Wednesday evening passed more peacefully with police saying the vast majority of fans left pubs and parks with their heads held high and without issue.  A mass brawl kicked off in a Birmingham city street involving over a dozen men outside the Cat and the Fiddle pub in Great Barr. In the footage, shocked football fans look on in horror as men and women swing for each other in the middle of Waverley Avenue. Screams, cursing and grunts can be heard as the woman is attacked once more amid a large crowd of brawling fans.  One woman is even knocked to the floor in the vicious brawl as another female is seen throwing something at her. Several punters try to hold each other back from getting involved in the violence, but it then breaks up into several smaller fights. One man hurls several punches at a younger male, before chasing him around the corner towards Beacon Road. On Broad Street, 100 onlookers egged on as revellers jumped into the canal, including one young woman who needed treatment from an ambulance crew.  In a tweet, the service said: It’s been a disappointing night already, please don’t make it worse by doing something you might regret for the rest of your life. Lots of calls coming in for fights and other incidents leaving people injured when they didn’t need to be. #staysafe #HeadForHome  And the number of 999 calls has skyrocketed since Croatia\u0027s victory over England, the Assistant Chief at West Midlands Ambulance Service said. The service says it had taken over 240 emergency calls in the first hour since the football finished, compared to just 120 when fans were placated by the match.

The airline held 11th-hour discussions with pilots\u0027 union IALPA at Dublin Airport in an effort to avoid the planned industrial action.  Ryanair stressed that only some Ireland-UK flights will be affected tomorrow and all flights to mainland Europe will go ahead, the Irish Mirror reports .  In a statement released on Tuesday afternoon, a spokesman for Ryanair said it affected 30 out of 290 Irish flights that day.  And he said that Forsa, the trade union, rejected 21 separate invitations to meet with them. In a statement, Ryanair said: “We regret to advise some Irish customers of a strike by just 94 (27%) of our 350+ Irish pilots on Thursday, 12th July. “We have tried to avert this disruption, which is unnecessary.  The Irish Travel Agents Association (ITAA) have commented on the announcement of 30 cancelled Irish-UK Ryanair flights today. CEO Pat Dawson said: “While these cancellations will affect 30 flights to the UK on Thursday, we feel a sense of relief that holidaymakers to Europe will not be impacted by this strike. We hope that while prospective travellers to the UK are experiencing disruption to their flights, adjustments can be readily made to travel plans and they receive the customer support they require. “On this occasion, the impact of this strike has been minimised for our travel agent members but the ITAA continue to call for reconciliation between pilots and the airline to reduce the threat of further action, which is very unsettling for Irish holidaymakers.” "},{"url":null,"title":"schoolboy 15 sent home for","story":"NewsSchoolboy, 15, sent home \u0027for wearing bra as part of protest at teacher\u0027s treatment of girl\u0027Raymond Deane claims he was sticking up for a female classmate by wearing the clothing item to Hugh Baird College\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByKate Mcmullin07:18, 12 JUL 2018Updated07:35, 12 JUL 2018NewsRaymond Deane, 15, with his mum Kim (Image: Gavin Trafford)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A schoolboy claims he was sent home from school for wearing a bra as part of a protest against a teacher\u0027s treatment of a female classmate.   Raymond Deane, 15, decided to wear the garment to Hugh Baird 14-16 College in Liverpool to stick up for a female classmate, says his mum Kim.   The Merseyside mum-of-two said her son was angry and upset, when he came home from school after a teacher had disciplined and sent home a girl for wearing a sports bra, reports the Liverpool Echo .  She said: Raymond thought that the girl should have been taken to one side and spoken to rather than disciplined in front of everyone.  He was upset because he thinks it is body shaming girls who are already insecure. Kim said, unbeknown to her, her son came home and asked his sister and her friends for sports bras to wear at school the following day. And the following day he and three friends arrived at the school wearing their sports bras in solidarity. However, the mum claims the four pupils were put into isolation and told to either take off the sports bras and go back to class or risk being sent home. The 36-year-old said: His friends took them off and went back to class, but he didn\u0027t and was sent home. He said the girl kept walking past the isolation room and smiling. He said if he had taken it off there would have been no point to the stand he was making.  Kim said her son, who previously attended The Blue Coat School, wanted to stand up for the female pupil and said she was proud of him. She said: I had no idea until I was sent pictures of what he had done. But I am very proud of him for standing up for young girls that are probably already insecure. I understand that the teacher had to send him home, because the girl had been sent home, but I don\u0027t think she should have been sent home in the first place. Hugh Baird is meant to be for pupils who don\u0027t fit into other schools and they are allowed piercings and pink hair - so why not sports bras?

Beth Bamford claims she had no idea she was pregnant and was stunned when she ended up giving birth alone in her bathroom. The 21-year-old, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, gave birth to 5lb 10oz daughter Willow as boyfriend Andy Morris, 22, lay sound asleep just along the landing. Poor Beth called for an ambulance and emergency services talked her through pushing out the afterbirth – but instead out popped twin Freya weighing 5lb 1oz.  But the new mum was terrified when the baby, who was breech, wasn’t breathing. Thankfully the quick-thinking emergency service caller was able to coach Beth through a lifesaving ‘little shake’ and the smaller twin took her first breath. Beth, who was already a mum-of-two, had visited her doctor numerous times thinking she was ill but neither the mum nor her doctors realised it was because she was pregnant. She claims she showed no signs of pregnancy because she was still having her periods, was not eating any more than usual and put the small amount of weight gain down to \u0027fat\u0027. However Beth says the new babies are a great surprise addition to her family. Beth said: “It’s a big shock but a nice surprise. I didn’t know I was pregnant at all.  “I was in bed with my partner and I was getting pains. I didn’t say anything to him but I went downstairs to get a glass of water and they got worse and I thought I needed the toilet. “I was still sitting on the toilet when I gave birth. I didn’t really have time to feel anything as it was happening. “It was a rush. One moment I was getting pain and the next moment I have got two new babies. “I hadn’t phoned an ambulance but I called the emergency services and they talked me through it as I gave birth to the first one.  “They told me I needed to get the placenta out. I pushed again but another baby came out, not the placenta. It was a shock. “The second one wasn’t breathing because she was breech. I was panicking about what to do because I wasn’t sure what to do with one, let alone two. “Nobody was answering me when I was shouting and I couldn’t wake my partner up because I was on the floor with the babies and couldn’t move. “Andy eventually woke up and walked into the bathroom and just looked at me. “He went to his mum’s bedroom and said: ‘Beth’s got two babies in the bathroom’. “She thought he had lost the plot because she knew we had two children already.  “Two ambulances came and asked lots of questions, like how far along I was or where my notes were. “They assumed I knew that information and had notes, but I didn’t. “I told them I didn’t know I was pregnant or having twins, but nobody believed me – even my partner thought I had hidden it from him. “I had had the shock of giving birth to babies, and then people accusing me of not knowing. “I had nothing, no nappies or anything, to take with me to the hospital.” Doctors believe Beth was around 37 weeks pregnant when she gave birth to the non-identical twins on February 21. She was told that if she had given birth in hospital, she would have had a C-section because Freya was breech. The newborns and their mum spent a week in hospital where she and the babies were checked over and monitored for signs of distress. But Beth, who is already mum to Elsa-Mae, three, and Alivia, two, was happy when all three of them were given the okay to go home. Beth said: “I feel lucky because it could have been a lot worse. “I have settled down a bit now, but it is scary going from two to four. It helped having a lot of support. “I have not had to go to and buy anything for them, because people went out and bought clothes and baskets and things for them. “I showed no signs of pregnancy and I even had my periods.

Researchers have found ancient tools in China which they believe may indicate primitive humans were in the area as early as 2.12million years ago. These tools are around 270,000 years older than the bones and stone tools found in Dmanisi, Georgia. The research was carried out a by Chinese - British team and their findings have been published in the scientific journal, Nature.  The finding was made at Shangchen on a plateau in northern China, reports the BBC .   The artefacts are different stone tools which all show signs of being used. Many were made out of quartzite and quartz rock which probably came from the Qinling Mountains, which are about five to 10km away from where they were discovered. However, it is not known which human species made them. People living outside Africa can trace their origins to a departure around 60,000 years ago. This evidence is so important as the earliest indication of humans in Eurasia was from the site in Georgia, which dated to 1.8million years ago. Co-author Prof Robin Dennell, from the University of Exeter, UK, said: Our discovery means it is necessary now to reconsider the timing of when early humans left Africa. Africa has traditionally been seen as the place where species arose before heading out to the rest of the world. But some scientists have said Asia has an important place in the story of human evolution. This new evidence will make some researchers question how far back the human story goes in Asia.

Mum Olga Kuldo, 55, suffered dark thoughts and even feared she would die as she desperately clung to the airbed in the open ocean.  She had gone into the water for a quick swim - but ended up being buffeted by huge waves after strong currents swept her out to sea.  That night, she suffered hypothermia and feared attacks by sharks and other deadly creatures - with passing yachts failing to notice her. “The waves were huge, and I did my best to hang onto my airbed, recalled Olga, who amazingly survived the ordeal, against the odds.  “When the waves calmed, I was tired and feared I could fall asleep. So I sang songs to the birds flying over my head as a way of staying awake.” As dawn broke, the Russian tourist was then fried by the piercing sun. Fearing she might not survive, her thoughts turned to her husband Oleg, 59, and daughter Yulia, 28, who were worrying about her. “I thought of Oleg and Yulia, and then about all my relatives, she said. “I thought how they would be hurt by my death. This made me keep going. I had to fight until the very end. “I kept trying to overcome my gloomy thoughts.” Olga is reported to have been seven miles out to sea when she was eventually found after a plane spotted her floating in the water. Now, she has spoken out about her horrifying plight for the first time, revealing how she managed to survive her 21 hours of terror.  The cardiologist had gone for an afternoon swim - despite worsening weather and a ‘yellow’ warning flag - without telling her family. They thought she was having three-hour spa session on the Greek island, when in fact, she had been swept out to sea by the currents. “I went into the water, lay on my lilo and next moment the waves carried me away from the shore,” recalled Olga, from Zelenograd, near Moscow. “In no time, I found myself in deep water where I couldn’t touch the bottom with my feet. I am not a good swimmer, so I just grasped tight to my airbed and thought that soon I would manage to paddle my way to the shore. “But instead, the current and the wind carried me further and further away… then I began to shout and wave but nobody on the shore noticed.” As Olga found herself in the open water, her husband and daughter were worrying about her in their resort of Rethymno.  As night came, an eagle flew over my head and then a storm broke out ten minutes later,” the mother said. She sang to the birds flying above her, talked to herself and even counted the moves of her arms to stay alert. I did not sleep for second, I kept moving,” she said. I was so sure that if I put just a bit more effort, soon I would reach the shore, but in reality I was not moving at all. “I constantly saw some yachts - but they were far from me. I thought about ships or fishermen, but no-one came close enough to me.” As more birds flew by, Olga feared that one of them may get interested in me and my airbed. “I feared they may want to peck my head or airbed, she said. “It was truly horrible at night, all sorts of thoughts flashed across my mind, and the storm was outrageous. I did not look back trying to face the waves with my back because it was horrifying.  “I only hoped that these strong waves would bring me to the shore but nothing like this happened.” She admitted that, at times during her ordeal, she was overcome by “dark thoughts” and the fear she would die. She thought of letting the airbed go - but thankfully didn’t. It was her lifeline and without it, she would have drowned. She had another fear, too - sharks or other threats in the deep. “I felt things touching my legs, Olga recalled. “I kept assuring myself it was just seaweed, nothing dangerous, that there was nothing down there that could harm me. “I just kept hoping that the right wind would come, or a current would carry me back to the shore.” Olga\u0027s family had realised something was amiss at 7pm local time, when she failed to return from her spa appointment. By then, the mum had been in the sea for four hours. Her belongings, including her purse, were found on the beach.  “This was the start of our nightmare,” said Yulia, a TV producer. Police came to the hotel and several large boats were sent out. “It was not possible to use small boats near the shore because the weather was bad, it was a storm, she added. The family was reportedly told that a helicopter would be deployed to search for Olga - but only the next morning. Yulia was in panic. “We were told to wait, to calm down,” she claimed. “But I kept asking questions, and the statistics was not encouraging – 10 to 20 tourists die in the sea at Crete each year.” The frantic daughter found herself asking morbid questions. “I asked how often they find people or their bodies, or do people just go missing and it ends with nothing…? she said. “I wanted to know how quickly a dead body would come to the surface…” She said she and her father couldn’t sleep. “I fainted several times,” she said. “I had dreams - in one my mum suddenly walked in she and sound.” But she also saw her mother being covered by waves, and drowning.  “The feeling of helplessness was disgusting, she added. “We did not know how we could help the search operation. “At midnight, they said the storm was worsening. It was slowing down the rescue operation. “This is when we expected the worst. But my dad said if anyone would stick herself to the airbed, my mum would. “But he also worried she could be covered by a wave.” The pair walked along the beach in the morning. By this time, divers were our looking for Olga. “They were searching for her body,” admitted Yulia. “No-one believed she could survive. Yet by the following morning, Olga had survived the storm, and she congratulated herself on reaching her 55th birthday. But she also feared she would not live to celebrate it with her family. They had planned a day trip to Santorini as a birthday present. In her head, her husband and daughter had set off on the trip and when she got herself to shore, she could get a taxi and catch them up.  “I did not blame the sea,” she said. “I was singing songs about the sea, all I could remember, talking to my family, but I was not angry about the sea. “I only asked it – ‘why do you want me? What do you need me for?’ During her agonising time out at sea, the mum could mostly see the shore in the distance. But she said it never occurred to her that searches were under way to find her. Somehow, she believed she had to get back herself. “I saw the coast and sometimes people walking there, she recalled. I waved but no-one saw me.” In fact, once Oleg and Yulia raised the alarm, boats had gone out. However, they had failed to locate Olga. “And at one moment a plane flew over her head,” said Yulia. “Then a second plane. “This returned and flew over her once again. “My mother thought it was just some random plane. She knew she had to send some kind of a signal because her forces were leaving her. “She just put her hands together as if she was praying”. Olga said: “I could hardly move, my muscles felt like stones. “I was hardly moving, I thought the pilot may not understand that I need help, so I just put my arms together as if I was praying, and lifted them over my head.”  In fact, the crucial first sighting was from a Frontex plane - which patrols the external borders of the European Union, monitoring for illegal immigrants. “As soon as the second plane disappeared over the horizon, I heard a boat’s engine and understood that it was heading straight to me, she said. “Five big men dressed in dark clothes were standing on it and shouting as loud as possible – they were shocked to find me alive. “They threw me a floating ring, and waved me to grab it, but I was quickly sorting my bikini which had slipped off. “I just could not be seen like this by the men – I think they understood it and waited. Yulia recalled the moment her mum was saved. “They began to lift her from the water – and my mother only worried that her bikini,” she said. “She also wanted to keep her airbed but at the last moment she lost it, and the wind swept it away like a balloon.” The brave mother was wrapped in a thermo-blanket and had an oxygen blanket placed on her face.  “She did not quite understand the scale of her accident,” Yulia said. Olga had suffered hypothermia and dehydration, according to her family. The skin on her back was also badly burned. Yulia was at the hotel reception when the news came through. “It was at this moment police called,” she said. “They reported that a woman was spotted in the sea who was likely to be my mother, but it was not clear at that moment. I was given a chair to sit on, so I crossed my fingers and begged that it was her. “In three minutes I heard hotel people shouting, they ran up to me and confirmed it was really my mother. “I suddenly felt weak and my body instinctively bent double. “Next moment somebody caught me falling down. “They poured water on me and slapped me on the cheek. “It really helped me to come back to my senses. “I felt my legs again and they obeyed me. “I stood up and rushed to tell my dad.” They were driven to a local hospital to be reunited.

You play for the glory and to win things.“If you are asked, you would say you would love to leave a legacy and Gillie has certainly done that.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b434788ba270-719x564.jpg ","title":"a true legend dundee fc league winner pays tribute to exceptional dark blues and tottenham striker alan gilzean","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn exceptional striker and a lovely man who was never changed by stardom.That’s how Dundee legend Alan Gilzean is described by fellow Dens Park great and championship winning team-mate Bob Seith.Gilzean died on Sunday at the age of 79, less than a month after it was revealed he was battling a brain tumour.It was a sad day for Seith, one of four surviving members of the Dark Blues greatest-ever side, but he was able to recall the many happy memories of his friend and colleague.“It’s sad news and my thoughts are with Alan’s family,” he said.“I was just thinking about him the other day and wondering how he was, so it’s sad to hear of his passing.”Recalling their time together, what Seith highlighted first was Gilzean’s superstar status on the park was matched by being a class act off it.“Alan was an exceptional striker for Dundee and Tottenham, but that never changed him. He was always the same nice lad.“I think that was one of the strengths of the Dundee team that won the championship – we were all good friends. There were no cliques in the dressing-room and none of us let our success go to our heads.“I remember when Alan was at Spurs and I was manager at Hearts, we played them in a friendly. He was a big star, but he was exactly the same as he was when we were at Dens.”“Gillie” scored a club record 169 goals in 190 appearances in dark blue and, after leaving for London in 1964, went on to earn similar legendary status at White Hart Lane, where he formed lethal striking partnerships with Jimmy Greaves and Martin Chivers. None of that came as a surprise to Seith, who rates him as one of the best ever.He said: “Alan was exceptional and a great header of the ball. His timing in the air was the thing and when he jumped he seemed to hang in the air. We knew that if we could get the ball to his head he would score goals.“At Dundee he had a fine partnership with Alan Cousin and he would have been the first to say Alan Cousin’s donkey work was responsible for him scoring as many goals as he did.“With Alan, though, it was not just about his heading, he had two very good feet as well. In fact, I was never sure whether he was left or right-footed.“He had the knack of being in the right place at the right time. He always seems to know where to be, that’s why he scored so many goals.”Former Dundee director and long-time friend, Dave Forbes, also paid tribute. Organiser of a number of events down the years to honour the 1961/62 team, he knew Gillie well.He said: “I knew he wasn’t well and I’m just glad it all seems to have been quite quick and he didn’t suffer for too long.”Particularly after spending 10 years in the limelight at Spurs, where he was dubbed the King of White Hart Lane, Gilzean was famous for valuing his privacy.For a long time after he retired, the native of Coupar Angus did not make many public appearances but, over the past decade or so, was a familiar figure at White Hart Lane on match days and made regular visits back to Dundee.“Gillie was a private man, but he was a gentleman.“I remember when we were organising Dundee’s centenary celebrations he was a big help,” added Forbes.“I am proud, honoured and privileged to have known him as a good friend.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"community chest cash would be bloomin great for broughty ferry gardening group","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn award-winning community group is hoping to bolster its coffers through the Tele’s Community Chest competition.Broughty Ferry In Bloom has hosted gardening projects including the planters and hanging baskets on Brook Street, Fisher Street and Windmill Gardens.Joan Chalmers, secretary of the group, said: “We have been going for more than 10 years now.“For the last eight years we have won a Silver Gilt medal in the Keep Scotland Beautiful competition.”The group meets informally at Duntrune Community Garden on Tuesday mornings between 10am-noon to work on tasks and plan ahead for the year.It also meets in Broughty Ferry Library on the second Tuesday of the month at 7pm and meetings are open to all.Joan said: “We have got about eight active volunteers but we’ve got more members than that.“The group is well known in the area and also takes part in litter picks and works alongside the various nurseries in the area and Grove Academy.”She added: “We have to do all our own fundraising. Plants are expensive.”If the group was successful in collecting more than 50 tokens, Joan said the money would go towards plants as well as more hanging baskets.She said that a lot of the baskets that it has are not suitable to go up because they require a particular type of bracket.She said: “There is always something that we need some money for.”She added that money could also go towards high visibility vests for youngsters to wear when they are with the group as well as on miniature gardening tools for them to use.Joan said: “We always need more gardening tools. We are bringing stuff from our own gardens to use.”Joan said people have been very generous towards the group for its ribbon of poppies appeal, and added: “Hopefully they will be generous with tokens for us too.“We’ll see what we can do.”For your chance to win some cash for your community group all you need to do is collect at least 50 tokens by Saturday July 28.Enter via thetele/promotions.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3b4f0f73369-846x564.jpg ","title":"dundee bar intends to reopen months after closure","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA West End bar that closed without warning will reopen in September.The Mayfly and events space Door Below, on Perth Road, closed without warning earlier this month.But the pub has now announced it intends to reopen later this year after an extensive refurbishment.A post on The Mayfly’s Facebook page stated: “We are currently closed for refurbishment, reopening at the beginning of September.”The bar is owned by Fuller Thomson, which also operates Duke’s Corner and the Jute Cafe Bar at the DCA.At the time, staff said they had felt “feel very hurt and let down\u0026#8221 at the sudden closure.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b4485911d088-685x564.jpg ","title":"dundee fans in portugal an inspiration for keeper jack hamilton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDens Park new boy Jack Hamilton says the sight of Dundee fans making the trip all the way to Portugal to watch their side is an inspiration.The Dark Blues have been in the Algarve since last Wednesday, playing a training game with Sunderland and another with Portuguese top-flight side Portimonense on Sunday before finishing things off with a friendly clash with local side SC Farense last night.That game is expected to draw some away support after a handful of supporters showed up for the 4-0 training game loss on Sunday at the Estadio Municipal de Albufeira.And that dedication to their team is something Hamilton wants to repay in the coming season.He said: “It says a lot for the fans to come out here.“They could have gone anywhere on holiday to be fair but they’ve come here to show the boys a bit of support and we really appreciate that.“It’s fantastic and, hopefully, we can repay them for coming to places like this with good results.”For Hamilton, as a new signing, the trip to Portugal has been a great way for him to get to know his team-mates a lot better. And he is eager to get going when the competitive games finally get under way this weekend away at Stirling Albion in the Betfred Cup.“It’s been good, I’m really enjoying it,” he added.“It’s a fantastic club, fantastic fanbase as well. Everyone has made me feel welcome, the boys are brilliant with me and the manager and staff are really good.“I’m enjoying it and just desperate to get back out on the park and get playing again.“The facility is brilliant, the hotel is nice, food and everything is good – it’s everything you want and it’s good to get the boys all together.“Being a new boy as well, it’s good to be able to get to know everybody that wee bit better and getting a better understanding with everybody, I’m really enjoying it.”Hamilton started Sunday’s game against Portimonense in Albufeira before being replaced halfway through by Elliott Parish with the score at 1-0.The final scoreline of 4-0 flattered the Portuguese side a little and Hamilton insists there was plenty of good work done to help their preparations for the coming campaign.“It wasn’t the result we wanted, it was disappointing in that way but it was good to get back on the park again.“It was difficult conditions, absolutely roasting, playing against a good side but I felt there were times we played well and are starting to look like a good team.“They were a good side, the effort from the boys was there, we lost a few bad goals but, other than that, the boys worked hard.“We’re all gearing up for Saturday.“It was good to get back playing two 45 minute halves, a full 90 minutes as well. It’s a game we’re looking forward to.”Former Hearts goalie Hamilton has a rival for the gloves at Dens Park, with last season’s No 1 Parish having done well in the Dundee goal following the departure of Scott Bain.The 28-year-old has already issued a challenge to his new pal Hamilton ahead of the campaign that he’ll have a battle on his hands.It’s not one the new man is likely to shirk away from, however.He added: “I don’t think there’s anywhere there isn’t a battle for the gloves but it’s a fight I’m really up for and I want to be playing.“I got a good run at Hearts, 60-odd games but I’m here now to further that and I’m desperate to get more games and make myself better.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people baxter park picnic","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlenty of people turned out for the Park Lives ‘Picnic in the Park’ event at Baxter Park in the sunshine on Thursday.The sun was shining was various activities which included a giant snakes and ladders board and face-painting.One woman getting in on the fun was Maryfield Community Officer – Constable Lydia Thatcher, pictured, who was spotted getting her face painted by some youngsters.The next Picnic in the Park event, Messy Play, event will take place on July 12 from midday to 2pm and is suitable for all ages.

However, it wasn’t to be as while he rummaged in his bag to find the ring, he was interrupted by a group of German tourists.With the mood killed, they went to the beach, but after sunbathing for just 10 minutes, Craig said they should go back to the hotel because he was too hot.He chose the balcony of their room which overlooked the lake to ask Aimee to become his wife.Aimee couldn’t even answer and instead simply burst into tears of happiness.After careful planning by the couple, the morning of the wedding arrived and the sun was shining.Aimee said: “When I woke up and saw the sun I was so happy that I was getting my outdoor wedding.“It made the photos taken by Burfly Photography from the day look really green and beautiful.“We had a flower wall created by Celebre which was stunning and it would have been a beautiful backdrop for the ceremony too.”The bride was accompanied down the aisle by stepdad Graham and the ceremony conducted by humanist Neil Anderson was the highlight of the day.“We made sure that the ceremony wasn’t boring and it was very personal,” said Aimee.“Neil was absolutely incredible and delivered our story in a fun way.“The night-time reception was brilliant but the day-time was our highlight.”The pair took to the floor to have their first dance as a married couple to The Verve’s hit song Lucky Man, which was performed by band Paper Tiger.Craig and Aimee would like to thank their wedding planners Katy and Fiona, videographers I Do, bridal shop Annarose and all their family and friends.Aimee added: “I wouldn’t change a thing about my wedding.

We think they’re keen to see it happening.”The Marketgait proposals are one of a small number of developments cropping up away from the Waterfront.Mr Mudie said: “Because of the Waterfront people have a keener interest in looking at city centre sites for development.“If it wasn’t for that there wouldn’t be any of the interest there is now. Companies in Glasgow and Edinburgh will be watching to see what the appetite is. They see Dundee as an untapped opportunity.”The Marketgait project is the biggest, in terms of cost, that Brunton has worked on yet.Mr Mudie added: “One of the reasons we think the council are so keen is because they want to take some of the attention away from the Waterfront.“The petrol station works on its own but I’m assuming our client believes they can get more out of the site.”Mr Mudie says the developer has given his firm free rein to design the new building, and plans are set to be submitted to council “imminently”.The plans received mixed reviews from the public.Pat Rae, 49, an admin assistant from the East End, said: “You have buildings across the road which are lying empty – I don’t see why they aren’t developed instead. You get a lot of traffic but a lot of it is commuters so I don’t think it would attract many folk to the restaurant or shop. I don’t think it would be of much benefit.”Colin Potter, 52, a telecoms engineer from the West End, said: “I think it’s a good idea. There’s always a need for new housing. These will maybe not be that cheap but it might be that people move into these and free up other houses in the city.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tayside bank worker embezzled 820000 from customer accounts","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Tayside banker will face trial accused of embezzling more than £800,000 from customers’ accounts.Samuel Mackintosh, of Evelyn Terrace in Perth, is alleged to have taken the cash from three customers over a period of six months last year.The offences are said to have taken place while Mackintosh, 27, was employed as a personal banking adviser for the Bank of Scotland.Mackintosh is accused of six offences, all of which allegedly took place at Bank of Scotland branches in Auchterarder and Crieff between March and August last year.All the transfers are said to have taken place without the authority of the three account holders and Mackintosh is alleged to have embezzled a total of £820,766.54.Mackintosh denies all charges against him.A first diet was set for August 7 at Dundee Sheriff Court by Sheriff Alastair Brown.Mackintosh was granted bail in the meantime.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/01/5a53492e86b36-846x564.jpg ","title":"vision of low emission city as dundee hosts clean air summit","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDelegates from more than two dozen of the world’s leading low emission cities will gather in Dundee this week for a summit.Government ministers, entrepreneurs and business chiefs will gather together to share their experiences and discuss Dundee City Council’s eight-year journey in working towards using more green energy.Lynne Short, convener of the council’s city development committee, said: “There is no magic wand or silver bullet to becoming an ultra-low emission city.“It takes vision, dedication and a lot of persuasion to do what we have done including the introduction of dozens of electric vehicles (EVs) to our fleet, providing a network of EV charging hubs and bringing in a low-emission taxi policy.“But the rewards are huge in terms of sustainability, clean air and a hard-fought reputation for innovation and vision for the city recognised across the globe.”The conference will take place at Discovery Point today and will focus on policy issues around ultra-low cities, taxis, and the charging network.EV entrepreneur Dee West will also tell delegates about New Zealand’s journey to introduce infrastructure and vehicles, while a representative from The R\u0026ampA will speak about the ambition of golf’s governing body to integrate low carbon solutions into the staging of The Open.Representatives will be coming from cities including Nottingham, London, York, Birmingham, Barcelona and Frankfurt.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"woman admits gouging mans head and eyes at dundee street","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA woman who assaulted a man while she was acting with another person was placed on a restriction of liberty order by Sheriff Alastair Brown.Jolene Shields, 38, of Dudhope Court, had previously admitted that she assaulted Stuart Morley, threatened him with violence, seized hold of him and repeatedly scratched and gouged his head and eyes, all to his injury, at Victoria Road on December 15 2016.She also admitted failing to appear at court for sentence on March 5.Sheriff Brown placed her on the order, between 7pm-7am, for three months\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"work starts to transform derelict dundee city centre site into flats","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWork has started to transform a derelict Dundee city centre site in into new flats.The land, at 3 Trades Lane, directly opposite Seagate bus station, has lain empty since 2014 when a former food factory was demolished.The road will be closed for 11 months as the construction work is carried out.Plans by Dundee architects James Paul Associates to rejuvenate the derelict site and build 28 new flats were approved by Dundee City Council last year.A barricade was erected around the perimeter last week as the initial construction work got under way.City development convener Lynne Short said the flats would bring a breath of fresh air to the area.The SNP councillor said: “I’m a great advocate of city centre living but this is an area that could use a bit of attention and I think this development will bring that.“Having affordable living in the city centre is great as almost everything is on your doorstep without the need of a car.“Flats such as this will bring a lot more footfall to the area.”A two-storey factory unit on the site, once used by McLeish Fresh Food, was demolished two years ago after lying empty since 2008. In a statement supporting the application, Angus Paul of James Paul Associates, said the block would be “respectful of the flats on both Trades Lane and the Seagate, also adding to the area by building on the site”.The new block will be constructed from sandstone, metal and glass, and will feature a public art installation in the side of the building.Inside, 28 two-bedroom flats will take

nearly 65 years was finally returned.The copy of A Window in Thrums by Peter Pan author JM Barrie was last seen at the Central Library in 1954.The book was spotted by a member of the public in a charity shop in London and was then posted back to stunned staff at the city centre library.Thankfully for the man or woman who found the book, they will not have to pay the late fees – estimated at around £1,500.JM Barrie’s book is one of a several he set around the fictional village of Thrums, which is believed to be loosely based on Kirriemuir in Angus, where he hailed from.Dallas King, events and programming officer at the library, said staff were shocked when the long-lost book dropped through the letterbox.He said: “We often get books returned to the library that are maybe a couple of days overdue but this particular book is 64 years, five months and 28 days overdue.“It was issued on January 13 1954 from this very library.“It wasn’t physically returned by the person who borrowed it.“It was actually found in a charity shop in London and a Good Samaritan has sent it up in the post with a note saying ‘I found this in a charity shop, thought you might want it back, it is slightly overdue’.“They found it and out of the goodness of their hearts had sent it back up.“It’s just great to have it back and it is a great story for the library as well.“The staff were in disbelief and excited that a book this old had been returned.“We have checked and it was taken out and issued and has been on a journey somewhere, who knows where, and has finally made its way back home.”The library is now considering displaying the book rather than returning it into circulation.The team is investigating how the book ended up more than 500 miles away over the last six decades.Dallas added: “Thankfully we cap our fines these days but I have worked out that, by going on the weekly rate, the fee would have been around £1,500.“Originally, we wondered whether the book was in too old a condition to put back on the shelves and we have thought we might put it on display as the book that travelled and came back.“I’m sure it is a novel itself working out where this book has been and finally it is coming home.”Operations convener at Aberdeen City Council John Wheeler said: “We are delighted to have this book returned.“It is astonishing that someone would hand it back after being

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"exciting shinty at the macaulay sixes","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 22/06/18, 8:15 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowNo fewer than 29 youth shinty teams travelled to Oban\u0026#8217s Mossfield Park for the annual Macaulay six-a-side competition.The winners of the main competition for P7 and under were Inverlochy, who defeated Taynuilt 1-0 in the final with Taynuilt taking the Oban Celtic Shield.The Alastair Campbell Shield for P5 and under was won by Braxi Boys from Inverlochy who defeated Bute in a very exciting final after extra time by one penalty to nil.The Macaulay Development trophy was won by Rockfield Rapids.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12468674.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_240218grant_07JPG.jpg","title":"maybole super school one step","story":"NewsMaybole super-school is one step closer to being builtCouncillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson15:27, 10 JUL 2018NewsNew Carrick Academy artist impression (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA \u0026pound42million super-school has taken a step closer to being built in Maybole.

St Cuthbert’s Primary – where parents responding to the consultation issued a rejection of the move – would also relocate but operate as a stand-alone school.

Nicola, 28-year-old classical singer married 30-year-old shipbuilding engineer John Hunter. The pair now live in Shawlands, Glasgow, but were both originally from Ayr. One Friday night back in 2009 John walked in to Harley’s Pub in Ayr to wish his cousin a happy birthday, and his sister told him to say hello to Nicola – her workmate at the time. “Nobody knows if it was the brown eyes, the sweet perfume or the six pints, three vodkas and the shot of Midori that caused him to steal my cardigan but steal it he did,” joked Nicola. She added: “A few days later, cardigan in hand, John returned it to H Samuel where I worked at the time. And that moment was the beginning of something special.” Since then both have enjoyed years of happiness and in October 2016 – seven years after meeting – John asked Nicola to marry him at Loch Lomond.  John and Nicola tied the knot on Thursday, June 7, at The Cruin at Loch Lomond. The couple said: “It was relaxing, elegant and absolutely perfect. “We can’t thank the staff enough. The weather, setting and scenery were breath-taking.” The bride wore a Vera Wang dress from David’s Bridal, Braehead, the bridesmaids also wearing gowns from David’s Bridal. The kilts were the Spirit of Lochearn tartan from Kilts 4 U. The wedding party consisted of Best man Mark Cosgrove, Groomsmen Niall Carney, Paddy McCurdie and Ryan Glass (nephew, aged 8), Maid of honour sister Jennifer Cassells, Bridesmaids Laura Dickson, Heather Armstrong and Aimee Trainer, Groom’s parents John Hunter and Hazel Hunter and the Bride’s parents Brian Cassells and Julie Cassells. The pair are currently celebrating being newlyweds in Bangkok, Thailand, and will be heading to Koh Samui, Thailand, then on to the Atlantis in Dubai.  3D Cakes created the couples wedding cake. The couple said: “We were inspired by the Scottish theme and used the same tartan ribbon that was on the kilts.” Kev Moulds Photography captured Nicola and John’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to look back on. The bouquets were arranged by Narcissus Flowers by Susan Hair and make-up was styled and created by Anna Wade (hair) and Lynn Brown (make-up).

Bids of \u0026pound1.5million are being sought for Enterkine House, perched above Annbank. The luxury four-star retreat, which boasts 74 acres of land, employs around 50 staff. Kirk House and Steading, a six-bedroom farmhouse currently used as overspill accommodation for the hotel, is also included. Agents Christie \u0026amp Co and Galbraith said the plot offered “potential for development under a new owner”. It follows a long-running noise battle at the hotel which saw bosses spend \u0026pound80,000 soundproofing their wedding marquee. Council chiefs were told that slapping an 11pm curfew on party bands could put the hotel out of business.  But they finally got the all-clear earlier this year and revealed plans to build a permanent structure. However, the hotel is now being offered to the market. Bob Cherry, a partner with Galbraith, said: “The purchaser of Enterkine would find it relatively straightforward to continue the current business, which is well-established, and there are further opportunities for diversification or expansion of the tourism and events facilities on the estate, subject to the necessary consents. “This is a beautiful estate with a thriving hotel business and potential for further development.” Brian Sheldon, of Christie \u0026amp Co, added: “The market for country house hotels such as Enterkine House has vastly improved in recent years. “Its location in South Ayrshire and within such an enviable estate and countryside will attract local, regional and potentially international operators. “Whilst the business is trading well, there is certainly scope for further growth.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"royal troon golf club make","story":"NewsRoyal Troon golf club make generous donation to hospital unitIt follows a charity 18-hole golf event with Troon Portland and Troon Ladies, writes Charlene Bennie.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post15:39, 10 JUL 2018News\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoyal Troon Golf Club has made the generous donation of \u0026pound1k to Crosshouse Hospital’s Acute Stroke Unit.

Steve the Seagull sneakily snatches a bag of crisps from bakery giant Greggs in Ayr. The sly bird checks to see if the coast is clear and grabs a packet of Walkers if staff are busy – and he’s tried every flavour. Greggs team member Charley Cooper said: “He could be in three times a day. He always goes for the crisps on the bottom shelf. He also took a pack of yum-yums recently. “He is like a thief in the night. He stalks this place. I shout ‘Steve’ and he flys off.” Hilariously the staff have dubbed the winged bandit ‘Steve Segal’ after the action movie actor.  Charley said the popular pest has been causing a flap for about two years. Air traffic controller Steve McNamara made a video of the bird in action last Tuesday. The dad-of-three said: “It was so funny. It landed outside Greggs, walked straight to the crisps stand inside, got a pack of ready salted and headed back out to the pavement. “ It then whacked the packet with its beak and devoured them. It only stopped to let out a cry of joy in the middle of its feast. “A few other people saw it and were incredulous. I had a feeling the bird wasn’t a first offender and it looked like it knew exactly what it was doing. It was a snatch theft.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article3294074.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/JS33570090.jpg","title":"up your game face boot","story":"NewsUp your game or face the boot - shock SNP ultimatum to South Ayrshire Council leaderIt comes as rival camps “fight like rats” to wrestle the council’s power base back on track.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson15:21, 10 JUL 2018NewsCouncil leader Douglas Campbell (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailUp your game or face the boot. That’s the shock ultimatum delivered by warring SNP councillors to their embattled leader. Douglas Campbell has been ordered to regain control of his split ranks during the council’s summer break. It comes as rival camps “fight like rats” to wrestle the council’s power base back on track. A racism storm and failed coup on Councillor Campbell has plunged the SNP into crisis. And the Post understands another plot to oust the leader is now brewing. It follows all SNP group members signing a declaration of support for their under-fire boss just two weeks ago. But a party insider has revealed growing disquiet is threatening to tear the group apart.  Within hours of the public show of support, Cllr Campbell was being placed under increasing pressure to step down of his own accord, rather than face another bruising challenge from within, the Post has learned. A senior source said: “People agreed to fall in line and sign the declaration for the sake of the bigger picture. “But it’s widely accepted that a change is required and this can’t go on. “The group is in a position where people will fight like rats to get what they want. “However, the even bigger concern is trying to keep the administration intact.” Worries over a potential walkout from Labour colleagues has, until now, ensured enough SNP support behind Cllr Campbell. A potential change in the their leadership is thought that have strained relations with administration partners, who have indicated they are happier working with Cllr Campbell.  But the Post understands that Cllr Campbell’s Labour past is forming a big part of the problem for the SNP leader as he battles factions within his new party. And a new warning – issued as councillors left for their summer break – stressed that he must crack the whip among his troubled ranks. The source added: “It was made very clear that if he doesn’t, the matter will be taken out of his hands. “The party is being crucified every week and it cannot be allowed to continue. “Some see Douglas as being far too close to Labour and that is undoubtedly a big issue for him. “Either way, he’s been given the message in clear terms that he needs to get everyone behind him and on the same page.” When asked about the warning, the group’s depute leader, William Grant, insisted: “This is news to me.” Cllr Campbell added: “Cllr Grant responded to your enquiry that ‘This is news to me’ and I have nothing to add.” "},{"url":null,"title":"26-year-old-admits-disturbances-at-bgh-and-innerleithen","story":"BACKGROUND reports have been ordered into an Innerleithen man who barricaded himself into a room before struggling violently with police.\nScott Ewart also caused a disturbance at Borders General Hospital later on May 28.\nThe 26-year-old of Millar Street pleaded guilty this week at Selkirk Sheriff Court to a charge of threatening or abusive behaviour at his home and also at the hospital.\nDuring the disturbance he had barricaded himself into a room in the house and ended up struggling violently with police constables.\nEwart remained disruptive at the hospital striking the handcuffs he was wearing against the wall.\nEwart also admitted a second charge of assaulting a police constable by spitting in his face.\nSentence was deferred for the preparation of a Criminal Justice Social Work Report until July 30.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"being-braw-lad-has-been-a-dream-come-true-says-greg","story":"ON Saturday Greg Kelly and Kimberley O\u0026rsquoMay realised their dreams of leading the cavalcade on Braw Lads\u0026rsquo Day.\nAnd it was an emotional occasion for the pair.\nBraw Lad Greg received the Burgh Standard at 8am on Saturday morning and returned it safely to the Burgh Chambers at midday, following a morning of celebrating Galashiels\u0026rsquo rich history.\nAnd it was a \u0026ldquodream come true for the 21-year-old who has always wanted to land the starring role.\nSpeaking after the events, he told us: \u0026ldquoA real highlight of today was receiving the Burgh Standard at eight o\u0026rsquoclock this morning and leading the cavalcade with my Braw Lass Kim.\n\u0026ldquoIt is a feeling that I will never forget.

Identity cards can be faked \u0026ndash phone the company to verify their identity.\n\u0026bull Some companies offer a password system. Ask your utility providers if this can be used and if you have a password with a company make sure the caller uses it.\n\u0026bull Never let people try to persuade you to let them into your home even if they are asking for help \u0026ndash they may not be genuine. If someone is persistent, ask them to call at another time and arrange for a friend or family member to be with you.\n\u0026bull Never agree to pay for goods or give money to strangers who arrive at your door.\n\u0026bull Don\u0026rsquot keep large amounts of money in your home.\n\u0026bull Remember, it\u0026rsquos your home. There\u0026rsquos no reason why anyone should ever enter your home against your wishes.\n\u0026bull If you\u0026rsquore not sure, don\u0026rsquot answer the door.\nFor more information, visit the Police Scotland website or contact your local community officer on 101.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"town-centre-building-set-for-facelift","story":"THE owners of a Bridge Street building in Kelso have applied to give their town centre property a makeover.\u0026nbsp\nDavid and Graeme Brechin, of Grant Avenue, Edinburgh, have applied to Scottish Borders Council for permission to renovate and repair the exterior of 6 Bridge Street.\u0026nbsp\nThe building is home to commercial properties, with a women\u0026rsquos clothes shop and charity shop occupying the ground floor, and the upper floors are divided into office accommodation.\u0026nbsp\nThe application outlined the aims of the proposal: \u0026ldquoRecently stonework had fallen off the building resulting in building standards involvement on public safety grounds and a scaffold has been erected.\n\u0026ldquoVarious options for repair have been considered, including renewing all the damaged stone with new natural stone indents but with 75 percent of the elevation delaminating it is prohibitively expensive and disproportionate to the capital value of the premises.\u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoRepairing individual stones in lithomix was also consider but is also not possible because of the large proportion of the fa\u0026ccedilade needing repaired.\n\u0026ldquoThe option the applicant wishes to pursue is for a more extensive render repair by cutting back virtually all of the facing stone, fixing an expanded metal base then expertly and uniformly stucco-rendering the fa\u0026ccedilade, scoring it to simulate ashlar stonework.\u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoCareful treatment around the window dressing, decorative eaves cornice and quoins will be carried out prior to the render coat application by a reputable, local stonemason, who will replace or repair the decorative stone to retain the character of the building.\u0026nbsp\nThe application will now be considered by Scottish Borders Council planning officers.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"noel-gallagher-tribute-band-to-play-galashiels-gig","story":"NOEL Gallagher fans in the Borders will be feeling supersonic as a tribute band rolls with it into the MacArts centre in Galashiels next week.\nThe band, named Acoustic Gallagher will be in town on Friday, July 13.\nThe gig will celebrate the songwriting talents of Oasis, as well as playing well-known classics and B-sides including Wonderwall, Champagne Supernova and of course, Don\u0026rsquot Look Back in Anger.\nDoors open at 7.30pm and music starts at 8pm.\nTickets\nare \u0026pound10, and are available by calling the box office on 01896 756852, or can be booked online at www.ticketsource/date/483994\nincluding \u0026lsquoWonderwall\u0026rsquo, \u0026lsquoChampagne Supernova\u0026rsquo, \u0026lsquoThe Masterplan\u0026rsquo, \u0026lsquoIf I Had a Gun\u0026rsquo, and of course, \u0026lsquoDon\u0026rsquot Look Back in Anger\u0026rsquo.\n\u0026lsquoSome might say\u0026rsquo that the Manchester band\u0026rsquos classics will receive an airing, along with work from Noel\u0026rsquos solo act, the High Flying Birds.\n\u0026lsquoWhat a life\u0026rsquo fans will also be in for a treat at the gig too.\u0026nbsp\nAdditionally, a licensed bar will be in operation on the night.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"galas-gareth-has-a-wicked-time-with-west-end-star","story":"AN aspiring performer from Galashiels has realised a lifelong dream by sharing the stage with one of musical theatre\u0026rsquos biggest stars.\nNineteen-year-old Gareth Williams, who is currently training for a BA (Hons) degree in Musical Theatre at The MGA Academy of Performing Arts in Edinburgh, was given the opportunity to provide backing vocals for West End and Broadway star Kerry Ellis during her 20th anniversary concert at The Queen\u0026rsquos Hall in Edinburgh.\nKerry is widely considered to be the one of musical theatre\u0026rsquos biggest stars and has previously starred in Wicked, We Will Rock You, My Fair Lady, Miss Saigon, Oliver!

from both sides \u0026ndash meeting twice a year, including one summit of the British PM with leaders of the remaining 27 member states and heads of EU institutions \u0026ndash to oversee the agreement and discuss proposals for change.\nA joint committee would underpin technical and administrative functions, with a \u0026ldquorobust independent arbitration panel to decide on disputes, ensuring that rulings on differences between the UK and EU are not made by the courts of either side.\nCrucially, the panel would be able to seek guidance from the European Court of Justice, but only on the interpretation of EU law.\nUK courts would pay \u0026ldquodue regard to EU case law only in areas where Britain has agreed to observe a \u0026ldquocommon rulebook in areas like trade in goods.\nThe 98-page White Paper, agreed at a Cabinet summit at Chequers last week which led Boris Johnson and David Davis to quit the Government, outlines UK proposals for what Mrs May describes in a foreword as \u0026ldquoa principled and practical Brexit that is in our national interest and the UK\u0026rsquos and the EU\u0026rsquos mutual interest.\nKey features of the Future Framework plan include:\n\u0026ndash A new free trade area in goods, based on a \u0026ldquocommon rulebook of regulations necessary for frictionless movements across borders, which will require the UK to commit by treaty to ongoing harmonisation with EU rules\n\u0026ndash Continued UK participation in and financial contributions to European agencies covering areas like chemicals, aviation safety and medicines\n\u0026ndash A facilitated customs arrangement, removing the need for checks and controls between Britain and the EU and allowing differing UK and EU tariffs on goods from elsewhere in the world to be paid at the border, removing the need for rebates in the vast majority of cases\n\u0026ndash New arrangements for services, giving the UK freedom to set its own rules and recognising that the UK and EU \u0026ldquowill not have current levels of access to each other\u0026rsquos markets\n\u0026ndash A new system for financial services, which will not replicate the EU\u0026rsquos passporting regime\n\u0026ndash Continued co-operation on energy and transport, a \u0026ldquocommon rulebook on state aid and commitments to maintain high standards of environmental and workplace protections\n\u0026ndash \u0026ldquoMobility rules which will end automatic freedom of movement, but allow UK and EU citizens to travel without visas for tourism and temporary work and enable businesses to move staff between countries\n\u0026ndash A security deal allowing continued UK participation in Europol and Eurojust, \u0026ldquoco-ordination of UK and EU policies on foreign affairs, defence and development, and wider co-operation in areas like cyber-warfare and counter-terrorism\n\u0026ndash Co-operation on the protection of personal data, continued use of the EHIC health insurance card and accords on shared programmes in science, culture, education and space\n\u0026ndash Annual negotiations on access to fishing waters and the sharing of fish stocks.\nBoris Johnson and David Davis quit over the Brexit agreement (PA)\nThe paper states: \u0026ldquoWhile what the Government is proposing is ambitious in its breadth and depth, it is also workable and delivers on the referendum result, fully representing the sovereignty of the UK just as it respects the autonomy of the EU.\nIt says that the Future Framework agreement must be concluded together with the separate agreement on the UK\u0026rsquos withdrawal, and called for both sides to focus on putting it into effect \u0026ldquoas soon as possible.\nUK negotiators will be told to engage with EU counterparts \u0026ldquoat pace with the aim of reaching substantive agreement on the Future Framework later this year.\nBut details of the plan are likely to cause contention, including proposals for the financial sector which firmly reject the EU\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoequivalence system under which countries can win access for their companies by showing their rules meet European standards.\nThe UK instead proposes a new economic and regulatory arrangement in financial services based on the principle of \u0026ldquoautonomy for each party over decisions regarding access to its market and underpinned by treaty commitments.\nThe arrangement should respect the regulatory autonomy of each side, while ensuring that decisions are \u0026ldquoimplemented in line with agreed processes with consultation and collaboration between the two sides, the White Paper says.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new

The Aqualibrium is not where most people want to cross.\u0026#8216People going to and from the Co-op and Tesco want to cross at the junction between them.\u0026#8216Likewise, people going to the harbour from the town centre want to cross at the Royal Hotel.\u0026#8216As it is, as a driver I was unaware the town had any crossings, apart from the pelican crossing in the Main Street. None are marked for drivers.\u0026#8216Is there any point in having them if drivers do not know they are there?\u0026#8216If they are indeed crossings, mark them. All road users need to know what they are in the interest of safety.\u0026#8217Mark Sutherland: \u0026#8216I have on several occasions crossed the road near the Co-op, and due to the speed of some inconsiderate drivers have had narrow misses. As for reporting to the police, this is ridiculous as the police would not really be interested as they have enough to do.\u0026#8216It is obvious if you stand there long enough that several people try to cross and give up or take a chance.\u0026#8216A crossing is required, especially for the elderly and infirm, as they can not make it across as quickly.\u0026#8216Common sense needs to be implemented by the right authorities to ensure that pedestrians can cross safely.\u0026#8217\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"pedestrian crossings","story":"There are also no traditional pedestrian pelican crossings.

supplies during the current period of hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer usage has increased significantly.With the current weather conditions forecast to continue people should take simple but important steps to conserve public water supplies.In some areas there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water during the summer and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely and  to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Some water treatment works and distribution networks are working at near capacity to meet demand.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of usage and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce usage wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their usage and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible, use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.Scotland’s public water supply is the lifeblood of the country, for household and business customers and more than 1.3 billion litres is used per day.There is a strong and resilient water distribution network but everyone will need to play their part as Scotland enjoys its hottest and driest summer in many years.To help customers use water wisely, advice is at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or by calling 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer,Chief Operating Officer,Scottish

Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7984867.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=159\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"east-lothian-courier-wedding-competition-winners-revealed","story":"  Gemma Peters and Jamie Richardson are the couple who have claimed the prize of a wedding worth \u0026pound6,000 at the Dunmuir Hotel.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.

We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.  The museum is open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10.30am to 4pm each day."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8006789.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"coast-road-closed-after-car-overturns","story":"  Police said one person was trapped in a car which has overturned and they have closed the road while work to free them is carried out.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"  A games development team, made up of students from Abertay University, will take on the best in the world at the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle.  The competition \u0026ndash dubbed the Olympics of Tech \u0026ndash seeks out the most innovative and potentially world-changing software solutions and comes with a first prize of $100,000.  Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.  The Abertay team are focusing on making the simulator better before they head to Washington.

A post from the youth project said: \u0026ldquoOver the past three years, young people have been looking at youth provision in North Berwick and have been shocked to learn just how much has been lost and never replaced.  \u0026ldquoThe team have been working hard to receive advice from East Lothian Council on what can be put in place to ensure a safe environment for all, as well as actions which can be taken to discourage anti-social behaviour. The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.  The couple told the Courier they had experienced long-standing anti-social behaviour from youngsters who already gather at the shelter.  Mrs Paul said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had bottles thrown into the garden \u0026ndash they are loud and they get up to all sorts. It\u0026rsquos been going on five or six years.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.

She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

In April, Police Scotland asked East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board to review the pub\u0026rsquos licence and that of its manager Christopher Darling.  However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.  He said that if given approval to go ahead the pub could re-open early next year.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.  She said: \"The announcement has been made to our network of hosts and producers, many of them will communicate to their members when they are ready, and we will do a public communication in August.\""},{"url":null,"title":"talented-teenage-drummer-clara-wilberforce-joins-national-youth-pipe-band-of-scotland","story":"  Clara Wilberforce, who has been playing the snare drum since she was in P6 at King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, has linked up with the National Youth Pipe Band of Scotland\u0026rsquos development band.  That came after a rigorous audition process, which saw the 15-year-old perform to a group of judges.  Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.  Her first event will feature Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain at the Phil and Aly RSNO St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day Concert at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on November 25.  Music runs in the family, with older brother Ninian, playing the pipes, while Juliet plays the piano and dad Marcus is a member of Haddington\u0026rsquos Siancio Singers.  Clara, who is in S5 at Knox Academy and studying Higher maths, English, geography and human biology, is also a member of the school\u0026rsquos pipe band as well as Haddington Pipe Band, where she is a senior drummer.  Her mum, who praised the efforts of Davey Barnes, who runs Knox Academy Pipe Band, and Dave Henry, drum teacher, said Clara \u0026ldquoloves the drumming and she had made a number of good friends through music and boosted her confidence.  Alastair Bruce, chairman of Haddington Pipe Band, congratulated Clara, who lives in the town, on the achievement.  The youngster won the band\u0026rsquos Niall Fairgrieve Award in 2014 for most improved drummer and has continued to impress.

Now his son Kit, who lives in Belhaven, has released a new version of the tale which looks at Chris\u0026rsquo 30-year career with the company, its characters and ships.  The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.  Kit \u0026ndash who last year released The Triumph and Tragedy of the Bantams, which focused on a band of \u0026ldquobrave but largely forgotten soldiers \u0026ndash has added his own stories of being a \u0026lsquoMacBrayne Child\u0026rsquo.  He added that his dad was known as the \u0026lsquostoryteller\u0026rsquo in the family and he wanted to make sure the stories were available to a new generation.

The dad-of-three said: \u0026ldquoThe TV course has been a brilliant journey.  \u0026ldquoColleagues often ask where I find my energy, and sometimes I have to ask myself the same thing, especially at 4am when I have forgotten to go to bed. Perhaps my endurance and resilience comes from my 12 years as a commando.  \u0026ldquoThere have been sacrifices, the biggest of them being to have had no social life throughout this time, but I am passionate about television and I am now talking to production companies and hoping to make my mark in the documentary genre.  While Matt admits it was \u0026ldquoeasy to feel envious of weekend revellers partying, he said driving taxis allowed him to refine his interview skills for his TV career ahead.  And among those to grace the back seat of his cab over the last nine years have been the likes of Angus Deayton, Ian Lavender, Paul Merton, Alexei Sayle, Ruth Madoc and Steven Berkoff.  Matt, who served with the Royal Marines in Northern Ireland, has already completed a music production with National Museums Scotland for a new exhibition on Scottish pop from the 1950s to present day.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.

A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.

To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done. They will be supported in this by a multi-disciplinary team from the partnership."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8058641.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"bus-mounts-pavement-in-tranent","story":"  The bus, which was not carrying any passengers at the time, struck a planter outside Giancarlos restaurant on Tranent High Street just before 8am.

A joint committee would underpin technical and administrative functions, with a \u0026ldquorobust independent arbitration panel to decide on disputes, ensuring that rulings on differences between the UK and EU are not made by the courts of either side.  Crucially, the panel would be able to seek guidance from the European Court of Justice, but only on the interpretation of EU law.  UK courts would pay \u0026ldquodue regard to EU case law only in areas where Britain has agreed to observe a \u0026ldquocommon rulebook in areas like trade in goods.  The 98-page White Paper, agreed at a Cabinet summit at Chequers last week which led Boris Johnson and David Davis to quit the Government, outlines UK proposals for what Mrs May describes in a foreword as \u0026ldquoa principled and practical Brexit that is in our national interest and the UK\u0026rsquos and the EU\u0026rsquos mutual interest.  Key features of the Future Framework plan include:  \u0026ndash A new free trade area in goods, based on a \u0026ldquocommon rulebook of regulations necessary for frictionless movements across borders, which will require the UK to commit by treaty to ongoing harmonisation with EU rules  \u0026ndash Continued UK participation in and financial contributions to European agencies covering areas like chemicals, aviation safety and medicines  \u0026ndash A facilitated customs arrangement, removing the need for checks and controls between Britain and the EU and allowing differing UK and EU tariffs on goods from elsewhere in the world to be paid at the border, removing the need for rebates in the vast majority of cases  \u0026ndash New arrangements for services, giving the UK freedom to set its own rules and recognising that the UK and EU \u0026ldquowill not have current levels of access to each other\u0026rsquos markets  \u0026ndash A new system for financial services, which will not replicate the EU\u0026rsquos passporting regime  \u0026ndash Continued co-operation on energy and transport, a \u0026ldquocommon rulebook on state aid and commitments to maintain high standards of environmental and workplace protections  \u0026ndash \u0026ldquoMobility rules which will end automatic freedom of movement, but allow UK and EU citizens to travel without visas for tourism and temporary work and enable businesses to move staff between countries  \u0026ndash A security deal allowing continued UK participation in Europol and Eurojust, \u0026ldquoco-ordination of UK and EU policies on foreign affairs, defence and development, and wider co-operation in areas like cyber-warfare and counter-terrorism  \u0026ndash Co-operation on the protection of personal data, continued use of the EHIC health insurance card and accords on shared programmes in science, culture, education and space  \u0026ndash Annual negotiations on access to fishing waters and the sharing of fish stocks.  The paper states: \u0026ldquoWhile what the Government is proposing is ambitious in its breadth and depth, it is also workable and delivers on the referendum result, fully representing the sovereignty of the UK just as it respects the autonomy of the EU.  It says that the Future Framework agreement must be concluded together with the separate agreement on the UK\u0026rsquos withdrawal, and called for both sides to focus on putting it into effect \u0026ldquoas soon as possible.  UK negotiators will be told to engage with EU counterparts \u0026ldquoat pace with the aim of reaching substantive agreement on the Future Framework later this year.  But details of the plan are likely to cause contention, including proposals for the financial sector which firmly reject the EU\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoequivalence system under which countries can win access for their companies by showing their rules meet European standards.  The UK instead proposes a new economic and regulatory arrangement in financial services based on the principle of \u0026ldquoautonomy for each party over decisions regarding access to its market and underpinned by treaty commitments.  The arrangement should respect the regulatory autonomy of each side, while ensuring that decisions are \u0026ldquoimplemented in line with agreed processes with consultation and collaboration between the two sides, the White Paper says."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7613338.jpg?htype=428\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glasgow-is-running-out-of-croatia-shirts-as-scots-back-englands-semi-final-opponents","story":"  Shops have been inundated with requests from customers who want to purchase the chequered kit before England\u0027s semi-final crunch match tonight.

Chef Vladimirs Kruus said: \u0026ldquoI have to say I\u0026rsquove never worked with such an unusual ice cream. We decided to serve it on a brioche bun as the bread is slightly sweet, and this will be toasted and dusted with icing sugar.

She said: \u0026ldquoWhen I was asked to make square sausage ice cream, I thought wow, here\u0026rsquos a challenge \u0026ndash and I love a challenge.  \u0026ldquoOne of the things we pride ourselves in is working under the motto \u0026lsquoif you can eat it, we can make it into an ice cream\u0026rsquo.  \"We\u0026rsquove had a shot in the past at making all kinds of flavours, from haggis ice cream to vodka sorbets, and the savoury flavours are definitely the bigger challenge.

The star ingredient of lorne sausage was sourced from Grierson Brothers Butchers in Castle Douglas before being cooked up, grated and added to the mix.  If you want to try it out, visit Apex Grassmarket this Sunday, July 15, where it will be served free of charge for one day only.

But Mr Mundell hit back, branding Labour \"just Nicola\u0027s little helpers\" as he attacked the \"once proud unionist\" Scottish Labour Party for \"repeatedly voting\" with the SNP in Holyrood.  Speaking during Scotland Questions in the Commons, Mr Sweeney said: \"I feel I ought to congratulate the Secretary of State on achieving a new milestone as the longest serving member in one role in the Prime Minister\u0027s Cabinet, though I fear it may be a virtue of his invisibility rather than his invincibility\u0026hellip  \"The Secretary of State is failing to stand up for Scotland\u0027s interests when it comes to shipbuilding and his 12 Scottish Tory colleagues and himself have failed to stand up for Scotland\u0027s devolution settlement.  \"So, will he use the influence he should have developed over these last few years and condemn his Government\u0027s handling of the devolution settlement, demonstrating he isn\u0027t just Scotland\u0027s invisible man in the Cabinet?\" asked the MP for Glasgow North East.

The Edinburgh MP asked the Scottish Secretary: \u0026ldquoHas he worked out yet what the impact of the PM\u0026rsquos decision on the Scottish economy and what is he going to do about it?  Mr Mundell said the heart of the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos document, which was \u0026ldquofed in to the Chequers summit, was that the SNP administration did not want the country to leave the EU.  \u0026ldquoWhat the PM is focused on is leaving the EU on the basis that does best for British business but also respects the outcome of a referendum of the whole of the United Kingdom.

Millions tuned into the eagerly anticipated match, with sorrowful scenes up and down the country after days of singing \"It\u0027s coming home\".  Crowds gathered in London\u0027s Hyde Park, Millennium Square in Leeds, Nottingham Castle, Birmingham\u0027s Archway outdoor cinema - and even Los Angeles.  England came to a standstill as the 7pm kick-off approached, with roads deserted and shopping centres abandoned as fans dashed home to catch the historic game.  The 23-man England squad, which has an average age of just over 26 and was the tournament\u0027s third youngest, had the hopes and expectations of a nation on their shoulders.  But place in the World Cup final against France was not to be.  Within the first five minutes, English fans were given cause for celebration when Kieran Trippier scored a free kick, giving his side a dream 1-0 lead.  The crowd in Hyde Park went berserk as England scored, and those watching on the huge screen were drenched in beer as plastic cups flew through the air amid wild celebrations.  Some fans had tears in their eyes as they could not believe the dream start.  In Leeds, the crowd leapt up as if a goal had been scored when the half-time whistle blew.  But there were stunned reactions as Croatia scored the equaliser through Ivan Perisic.  It would have been the nation\u0027s first final since they won in 1966 but an extra time goal from Mario Mandzukic left dreams shattered.  Many fans had their heads in their hands, while others shook their heads in disbelief.  Police estimated as many as 10,000 England fans were in the Russian capital for the game.  Among them were father and son Joe and Andrew Settle, from Bolton, who have never travelled away with England but decided they could not miss the chance to see the national side in a World Cup semi-final.  For Joe, 62, it was his first live England match.  \"I think it\u0027s our year this time.  \"There\u0027s no out and out stars and everybody just looks at them as young lads, making their way out, they\u0027ve not got above their station.

Excitement and tension began to build early ahead of yesterday\u0026rsquos game at Moscow\u0026rsquos Luzhniki Stadium, with British Airways handing out 300 waistcoats, as made famous by the England manager, to customers flying from Heathrow to the Russian capital.  In a nod to England captain Harry Kane, signs at Terminal 5 showed customers where to \u0026ldquoChecK-ane for the 8.45am flight, while fans were offered St George\u0026rsquos flag face painting as well as boarding passes with the customer name entered as \u0026ldquofootball and the destination as \u0026ldquohome.  The three words \u0026ldquoit\u0026rsquos coming home, from the Lightning Seeds\u0026rsquo anthem, have become the mantra of the team\u0026rsquos support as they stormed through the competition.  Ten of thousands of fans took to London\u0026rsquos Hyde Park and other venues across the country to watch the semi-final on a huge screens.  However, in Scotland, the reaction was more mixed, with thousands backing England\u0026rsquos opponents throughout the World Cup as part of the \u0026ldquofriendly rivalry between the two countries.  In Glasgow, shops said they were swamped with requests for the distinct red and white chequered first kit of England\u0026rsquos Croatian opponents.  A spokesman for the Nike shop in Glasgow said they had been \u0026ldquoabsolutely inundated with requests for Croatia shirts, while Greaves Sports said it had completely sold out the tops before the crunch match.  Managing director Sandy Greaves said it showed the fun rivalry that \u0026ldquonormally happens any time England plays.  \u0026ldquoLast Saturday morning all the die-hard Scottish fans wanted the Swedish jersey, he added.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a Scottish thing. I\u0026rsquom sure the same thing happens down south.The rivalry was on open display in some pubs in Glasgow, where there were loud cheers as Croatia took the lead in extra time.  \u0026ldquoI was supporting Croatia, said Jonny Cowan, 29, from Kilmarnock, who was watching the match in the Waxy O\u0026rsquoConnors pub next to Queen Street station.  \u0026ldquoI mean, it\u0026rsquos all about the friendly rivalry.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos all good natured, but we\u0026rsquore the auld enemies.  James Milligan, 24, from Tradeston, who saw the semi-final in The Raven in Renfield Street, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not like a lot of people that didn\u0026rsquot want England to win.  \u0026ldquoBut still I wanted Croatia to win.  \u0026ldquoIf England were to win the final, we would never hear the end of it.  However, there may have been more Scottish support for the England side abroad.  Royal Bank of Scotland said it had seen a 70 per cent increase in the number of debit card transactions in Russia over the course of the World Cup, compared to  a normal day outside of the tournament.  Haydn Williams, from RBS, said it was either a matter of Scotland fans secretly supporting England \u0026ldquoor perhaps they have been there supporting Tunisia, Panama, Belgium, Colombia, Sweden and Croatia.  There was also irritation for some Scottish viewers, with reports that the STV Player had gone down just minutes before the end of the cliffhanger semi-final.  Jamie and Ruth Aitken, from Peterborough, in Glasgow on holiday, said they were a \u0026ldquoa bit apprehensive about watching the game in Scotland.  Ms Aitken, who the saw the game at Waxy O\u0026rsquoConnors, said: \u0026ldquoWe asked people in the hotel where we should watch it and they said \u0026lsquoin our room\u0026rsquo.  And we were in Croatia a few weeks ago, so we thought we might get a better reaction there. But it\u0026rsquos been fine and people have been really friendly.

And when Ivana suggested the name Donald Jnr, his dad countered \u0026ldquoBut what if he\u0026rsquos a loser?  The point of these little revelations is that they reinforce our opinion of a man capable of displaying utter contempt for creeds - his Moslem entry ban nations - Mexico persons of colour - the African-Americans barred from renting his apartments. We\u0026rsquore reminded of his tax avoidance, and the small businesses the man with the small hands refused to honour his debts to.  We know President Trump\u0026rsquos integrity to be as thin as the hair covering left after his failed scalp reduction operation.  But that doesn\u0026rsquot mean our political leaders (if the FM and her cohorts are granted an audience) should not treat Trump\u0026rsquos arrival with respect. London Mayor\u0026rsquos Sadiq Khan\u0026rsquos sanction this week of a giant nappy-wearing Trump balloon was capital balloonery, ersatz State-sponsorship. (Wonder what would happen if anti-London Mayor lobbyists floated the idea of a diapered Khan?) And it was also hypocritical, given the UK\u0026rsquos ability to set aside human rights concerns over Saudi Arabia and Turkey.  Donald Trump may well be the Mad Hatter of World Politics, who can switch effortlessly to becoming the Queen of Hearts, killing off careers and opposition voices with a single Tweet. His administration puts children in cages. And as a political leader he makes our own clown Boris seem competent by comparison.  But The Donald represents the White House, and he bridges our relationship, so vital in the Second World War and during the Cold War, with the most powerful nation on Earth. The Leader of the Free World is coming to town (albeit to play a round of golf) and we have to treat him as such.  We have to push aside the fact he is the modern-day representation of WB Yeats\u0026rsquo 1919 poem, Second Coming \u0026ldquoThings fall apart, the centre cannot hold, mere anarchy is loosed upon the world. What is this strange beast slouching towards Bethlehem. (Holyrood?)  Indeed, our leaders have to understand and embrace the fact Trump singularly represents Yeats\u0026rsquo fear, when the poet anticipates the confusion, the terror of modern day politics, the growth of the far right across Europe, all confirmed by the fact that the venally ambitious Trump has been allowed to triumph in the first place.  For that reason we need to play the golfer. It would be all too easy for the FM and co to greet him waving Mexican flags or posting pics of little Guatemalan girls. That\u0026rsquos the job of student protesters and trades unionists and women\u0026rsquos rights groups, to take to the streets or the beaches of Troon or Aberdeenshire.. (Let\u0026rsquos hope predicted violence doesn\u0026rsquot ensue Trump won\u0026rsquot be looking out of the windows of Air Force One worrying about the havoc he\u0026rsquos provoked.)  But the reality is public name-calling won\u0026rsquot matter to this man who didn\u0026rsquot wish to have his son named after him in case he grew up to be a numpty.  Yet, he can be worked at a personal level. Like all petulant bullies he can\u0026rsquot handle face-to-face confrontation. So we can learn from French President Macron how to put Trump\u0026rsquos verbal gas at a peep. We can even learn from the \u0026ldquoLittle Rocket Man in how to lessen the likelihood of nuclear confrontation.  Our leaders, if they can get in a room with the man, need to be cleverer than Donald Trump, (which shouldn\u0026rsquot be hard.)They should feed him up on flattery and artery-hardening fudge, and then ask what he can do for our country?  It doesn\u0026rsquot matter that Nicola Sturgeon once refused to take calls from the man. Jaw-jaw is always better than war. So bring him onside, reach at least a vague understanding on trade economics and then try to get human rights onto the agenda.  And let\u0026rsquos bear in mind the upcoming Brexit chaos, (Trump\u0026rsquos declaration of a Britain being in turmoil is on the money), bear in mind too it could well open the door to Scottish independence - and the need to realign this country\u0026rsquos position on the world stage.  Trump\u0026rsquos arrival in Scotland in fact has its positives (if we can push aside the \u0026pound5m policing cost). He single-handedly represents the denial of democracy, the return of the despot to the West. He threatens the freedom of the press.  So let\u0026rsquos play with Ms Midlefart\u0026rsquos ex, but remember this isn\u0026rsquot a Chamberlain-Hitler scenario we\u0026rsquore dealing with. For not to do so could be dangerous.

Lithium in hot brine springs in Cornwall could provide the UK with a domestic source of the metal, which has been described as \u0026ldquothe new gasoline due to its potential to help in the shift to low-carbon energy supplies.  Now a study has shown that satellites can detect changes in vegetation and surface minerals, which, when combined with geological data, could indicate potential locations of lithium in the county once famous for its tin mines.  This kind of remote sensing could significantly cut the cost of lithium exploration and also reduce the environmental impact of mining by better targeting prospective sites, the team behind the research said.  The study of two areas of Cornwall combined different types of remote sensing techniques to better predict areas that may contain brine pools with lithium in them below the surface and identify target sites for further work.  Along with other measures such as heat mapping and geological faults, the team looked for potential indicators of lithium in vegetation cover for example, how healthy plants are, to help indicate where hotspots of lithium might be.  Prospectors could then drill down into the ground to pump out the hot, salty water which contains lithium and extract the metal rather than needing large-scale open-cast mines.  The team have also used the same range of satellite data to create an map showing where important habitats, flood risk areas and towns are situated to help with environmental monitoring of future mining.  Dr Cristian Rossi, principal Earth observation specialist, Satellite Applications Catapult, who led the\u0026nbspstudy, said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoWe are very excited by the findings of this project.  \u0026ldquoThis approach to lithium exploration, which includes the estimation of multiple surface indicators, has not been attempted before and may be highly applicable across the wider mining industry.  \u0026ldquoWe have shown that by combining a range of satellite data and expertise in UK mining, geology and Earth Observation, we can accurately map the environmental\u0026nbspbaseline and also delineate areas where lithium is more likely to be present at depth.  \u0026ldquoThese are the first digital maps that display potential lithium hotspots for initial investigation and\u0026nbspvalidation.  Jeremy Wrathall, founder and chief executive of project partner Cornish Lithium, said: \u0026ldquoThe results of the study, and our collaboration with other project partners, has enabled our company to significantly\u0026nbspadvance our exploration programme and to better prioritise areas on which to focus our exploration for\u0026nbsplithium-bearing brines in Cornwall.

Sorvino has now said that during an audition for a horror movie when she was a teenager, she was tied to chair by a casting director who then shoved a condom in her mouth.  She did not name the alleged culprit.  Speaking on the Hollywood Foreign Press Association podcast, she said: \u0026ldquoIn looking back over at my career, I realised that one of my very first auditions when I was 16, I was completely treated inappropriately by the casting director.  \u0026ldquoIn order to scare me for this horror movie scene, he tied me to a chair, he bruised my arm and, I was 16 years old, and then he gagged me, and I was all game because I\u0026rsquom trying to be scared for the scene. And at the end he takes the gag out of my mouth and he said, \u0026lsquoSorry for the prophylactic.\u0026rsquo So he had gagged me with a condom.  \u0026ldquoI was too young, thank God, to know what a condom tasted like. It was so inappropriate. And what the heck was a casting director doing with a condom in his pocket?  Sorvino, 50, was one of the first actresses to go public with allegations against Weinstein. In the New Yorker magazine in October last year, she said that Weinstein had chased her around a room after he started massaging her shoulders in a Toronto hotel in 1995.  Following the flood of allegations against Weinstein, Lord Of The Rings director Sir Peter Jackson revealed the producer had waged a smear campaign against the actress after she rejected his advances.  Weinstein told the filmmaker Sorvino was a \u0026ldquonightmare to work with, leading to her name being taken off his casting list.

Why? It serves beer when it opens at 9am, plays World Cup songs before the game starts and it\u0026rsquos a cozy space where no one frets over a spilled pint.  But if you were to ask me about the same pub on Wednesday afternoon, I\u0026rsquod tell you it was was a dark, hot, depressing dungeon of tears and sticky floors.  At least that\u0026rsquos what King\u0026rsquos Head, the famed pub in Santa Monica that is the home-away-from home for Los Angeles-based Brits and die-hard World Cup fans, became\u0026nbspwhen England went from leading 1-0 to losing 2-1 in extra time. It\u0027s one of a number of bars in America that caters to a largely-English crowd. Their customers\u0026nbspmight not necessarily invade an IKEA\u0026nbspin sports celebration, but would be down to crowd-surf at the bar (as happened in King\u0026rsquos Head before) or sing \u0026ldquoGod Save the Queen while holding up a replica World Cup in a Freddie Mercury mask (as has happened in Brooklyn\u0026rsquos Banter bar).  And so, even though USA isn\u0027t in the World Cup this year, lines to get into these pubs can run down the block, the bar can reach capacity and a game-heavy day can bring in three different waves of fans.\u0026nbsp  As King\u0027s Head bartender Raul Dourado says, \"It\u0026rsquos awesome. It\u0026rsquos (freakin\u0026rsquo) business!  But it\u0027s less awesome when England loses. Here\u0027s what happened on Wednesday at King\u0027s Head when Croatia upset the lads.  9:30 am\u0026nbspThe fight songs commence.  After fans are let in and the bar easily hits capacity (with wait staff adding velvet ropes to ensure they have a path to and from the bar), the singing begins. The King\u0026rsquos Head playlist includes these English crowd pleasers: \u0026ldquoVindaloo, The Clash\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoThis is England, Monty Python\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoAlways Look on the Bright Side of Life and Chumbawamba\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoTubthumping (I Get Knocked Down), which gets cut off, to boos. \u0026ldquoThree Lions (Football\u0026rsquos Coming Home) is played more than once. As Londoner Rupert Wilson explains, the song was at first a joke because fans had no hopes of getting to the World Cup finals.  But now, the catchy song has become a serious rallying cry with England competing in the semifinals.  Another tip from Wilson: Don\u0027t pronounce the \"H\" in \"Home\" when you sing it.  10:45am\u0026nbspOne more cheer before we start.  The crowd starts a double, triple, quadruple-clap \u0026ldquoEngland! chant. Everyone stands, and many people stay standing. (Seating is pretty limited.)

A few other spectators are traveling, unemployed or otherwise off work today. This is Los Angeles, after all.  1:10pm\u0026nbspEveryone\u0026rsquos still stressed.

A disgruntled fan can\u0026rsquot find a decent path to the bathroom. \u0026ldquoCan I go the the pisser? he loudly asks. Someone tries to lighten the mood with a cheer: \u0026ldquoCOME on, EngLAND, he says in an almost Cockney accent.  1:21pm\u0026nbspSomeone accidentally turns on the music.  In a bizarre move, an employee seems to accidentally play random pop music that has nothing to do with the game. Attendees boo the music and then realize, that, wait, did Croatia just score? Croatia just scored?! The bar goes quiet. Waitresses are transfixed on the match. Bartender Raul keeps staring at the screen and petting his beard.  1:38pm\u0026nbspCroatia scores again. Tears come.\u0026nbspIt\u0027s over.\u0026nbsp  It\u0026rsquos quiet. One man puts his head in his hands and keeps it there for a minute. The place quickly clears out. There are tears and sad hugs. Fans walk out of the formerly lively pub, which has become a sweaty room with not enough windows, and brace themselves for the hot sun. People don\u0026rsquot want to talk. They\u0026rsquore pissed.

The remaining nine per cent were don\u0026rsquot knows.  The findings increase the pressure on Ms Sturgeon as she considers her next move in the escalating constitutional fight with Westminster over Brexit.  The First Minister called a second referendum in March 2017, then \u0026ldquoreset her plan three months later after the SNP lost a third of its MPs in the general election.  She had promised to update MSPs on a \u0026ldquoprecise timescale on a second referendum this autumn, once the shape of the final Brexit deals becomes clear.  Earlier this week, her Brexit Secretary Michael Russell suggested a second EU referendum could double as an independence vote if the 2016 result was repeated and Scotland backed Remain and the UK voted Leave.  There is fight between the UK and Scottish governments at the Supreme Court between now and the autumn, which could end in Westminster trampling over Holyrood\u0026rsquos alternative Brexit Bill, a huge moment the SNP would add to their case for independence.  But the lack of popular support for a second plebiscite will be a concern for the First Minister.  Nevertheless, the poll also found support for independence slightly higher than in the 55-45 No vote of 2014, with 53 per cent opposed and 47 per cent in favour, excluding don\u0026rsquot knows.  The Scottish Parliament voted last year in favour of Westminster transferring the power to hold a referendum, but the request for a \u0027Section 30 order\u0027 was rebuffed by Theresa May.  If Ms Sturgeon pushed again for a referendum, the Prime Minister would almost certainly refuse again, but the SNP could cite the snub in the 2021 Holyrood election as evidence of Westminster arrogance, as they try to win a clear-cut mandate for a new vote.  Professor Sir John Curtice of Strathclyde University said the poll showed that, despite SNP hopes of a shift in opinion, Brexit was still having little impact on the independence question.  He said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the SNP have had somewhat the better of the argument in the row about the impact of Brexit Withdrawal Bill on the powers of the Scottish Parliament, there\u0026rsquos still no sign of any significant change in the level for support for independence \u0026ndash or much evidence of enthusiasm for an early ballot among the party\u0026rsquos supporters.  The Unionist parties said Ms Sturgeon should drop an idea the public didn\u0026rsquot clearly want.  Scottish Labour Leader Richard Leonard said: \"The people of Scotland want the government focused on jobs, schools and hospitals, not another referendum campaign that creates false divisions between working class people when the real divide is between the richest and the rest of us.  \"The chaos at the heart of the Tory government has focused people\u0026rsquos minds on the extreme challenges of leaving a political and economic union, and it is clear that there is not strong support for Nicola Sturgeon to try and force another referendum onto the agenda.\"  A Scottish Tory spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThis poll again shows the majority of people do not want a second referendum - and they overwhelmingly don\u0026rsquot want one any time soon.  \u0026ldquoNicola Sturgeon should use this research as motivation to take the threat of another divisive vote off the table.  The SNP highlighted the narrowing between the Yes and No sides on independence compared to 2014.  MSP Derek Mackay, the party\u0026rsquos business convener, said support for independence remained at historically high levels, \"with a Yes majority within the margin of error and well within touching distance\".  Dropping a hint that Ms Sturgeon was minded to push for a second vote, he said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore not - yet - in the heat of an independence campaign.  \u0026ldquoBut as Westminster moves from chaos to utter shambles, proving beyond doubt it is incapable of protecting our interests, the case for independence becomes ever stronger.  \u0026ldquoLittle wonder that since last year there has been a marked rise in the number of people who back giving the people of Scotland that choice over their future.  \u0026ldquoWith the full powers of independence we could make better choices in Scotland\u0026rsquos interests and avoid the damage of a Tory Brexit.  Scottish Green MSP Patrick Harvie added:\u0026nbsp\"It\u0026rsquos remarkable that support for independence remains so high given that the Yes movement hasn\u0026rsquot done a single bit of formal campaigning.  \"The status quo will no longer exist in March 2019 and I suspect that voters in Scotland will come to demand a say on whether we should be dragged along with this Brexit mess.\"  Survation interviewed 1002 Scots online between July 5 and 10."},{"url":null,"title":"salt-marshes-could-start-to-disappear-in-south-east-by-2040","story":"  Studying samples from sediments, experts have tracked sea levels over the past 10,000 years to study how changes have affected salt marshes.

The study, published in Nature Communications, shows that rising sea levels over the last 10,000 years has led to increased water-logging of the salt marshes, killing vegetation that protects them from erosion and resulting in the marshes retreating landwards.  Salt marshes are coastal wetlands that are flooded and drained by salt water brought in by the tides and can be found along the British coast.  They are a transitional area between water and land and are home to delicate ecosystems.  They also protect coastal areas from\u0026nbsperosion\u0026nbspby acting as a buffer for waves in storms and reducing flooding by slowing and absorbing rainwater.  Extensive marshes occur along major estuaries around Britain including the Thames, Solent, Bristol Channel, The Wash, Humber, Mersey, Solway Firth, Firth of Forth, Clyde and Cromarty Firth.  Co-author Professor Ian Shennan, from the Department of Geography at Durham University, said: \u0026ldquoSea level rise is inevitable over the next 100 years, as it has been over much of the last 10,000 years.  \u0026ldquoThe rates differ across Great Britain and we can model these differences.  \u0026ldquoQuantifying the vulnerability of marshes to sea level rise is essential if the threat is to be mitigated over the coming decades.  Professor Shennan said the Environment Agency has plans which include allowing new areas to flood.  The research involved scientists from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands, University College Dublin, College of William and Mary, and Rutgers University, both in the US, and Durham University."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-hails-plan-to-deliver-principled-and-pragmatic-brexit","story":"  The 98-page document \u0026ndash which prompted the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis from her Cabinet \u0026ndash contains much to enrage Eurosceptic members of her own party.  It envisages the UK entering an Association Agreement with the EU, accepting a \u0026ldquocommon rulebook on trade in goods and continued payments for participation in shared agencies and programmes.  And it is unclear whether it will win favour in Brussels, with resistance likely over Mrs May\u0026rsquos proposal for a \u0026ldquofacilitated customs arrangement at the border and her rejection of the EU\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoequivalence system for financial services.  The White Paper states that the future framework for the post-Brexit relationship should be settled at the same time as the separate deal on the UK\u0026rsquos withdrawal.  It calls for negotiations to proceed \u0026ldquoat pace with the aim or reaching substantive agreement later this year.  Key elements of Mrs May\u0026rsquos proposals include:  \u0026ndash A formal institutional framework bringing leaders and ministers from the UK and EU together in a governing body with regular summits  \u0026ndash A \u0026ldquorobust independent panel to arbitrate on disputes, so that neither side\u0026rsquos courts have the final say  \u0026ndash A free trade area in goods  \u0026ndash New arrangements for services, giving each side the freedom to set their own rules  \u0026ndash Continued security co-operation, participation in Europol and a range of EU agencies.

And in a direct challenge to Tory Brexiteers who have threatened parliamentary \u0026ldquoguerilla warfare to try to block the plan, he told BBC Radio 4\u0026rsquos Today programme: \u0026ldquoFor those that are either criticising or carping or whatever else, they need to come back with credible alternatives.  But Mr Barnier has warned that the proposals must conform to EU rules and not create extra costs as he told US business leaders to prepare for a no-deal scenario.  The EU negotiator said he would examine Mrs May proposals to see whether they were \u0026ldquoworkable and realistic.  Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Brussels needed to recognise the importance of reaching an agreement that worked for both sides.  \u0026ldquoWhat we say to the European Union is we\u0026rsquore not the only ones who can\u0026rsquot do the cherry-picking. If they want a deep and special partnership with Britain going forward, then we have to look at our relationship as a whole, he said.  \u0026ldquoWe are saying that we will defend Europe unconditionally \u0026ndash that is the big commitment that Theresa May has made. We need to find a way forward that works for both sides.  Mrs May wrote in the Sun that the plan was the only one which \u0026ldquotruly respects the will of the British people.  Meanwhile, Tory MP Maria Caulfield, who resigned as a party vice chairman in protest at Mrs May\u0026rsquos withdrawal stance, said Brexiteers were being held in contempt by a \u0026ldquosmall cabal in Downing Street.  Writing in the Daily , she said Mrs May\u0026rsquos plan was \u0026ldquocatastrophically bad and a \u0026ldquodisaster for the Conservative Party.  Unrest among Brexiteers over the plan means the PM may have to rely on support from outside her party to push it through parliament.  Opposition MPs and peers were briefed last week on the agreement struck at Chequers by Mrs May\u0026rsquos deputy, David Lidington.

They still have some way to go with other vacant posts but it is good to see GPs being recruited.\u0026ldquoHaving locums all the time means patients don\u0026rsquot see the same person, but with GPs you have a better chance of continuity.Dr David Carson and Dr Mike Ruse are set to join advanced nurse practitioner (ANP) Colin Armer \u0026ndash a recent recruit \u0026ndash at the Riverbank Medical Practice in Thurso.Dr Herjit Sutherland is to join the Riverview Medical Practice in Wick along with new ANP appointment Vicki Kelly.Mike Flavell, who is giving up his post as NHS Highland\u0026rsquos Caithness district manager, is an advanced physiotherapist and is to begin weekly clinics shortly in the Riverbank and Riverview practices as well as in the Lybster medical practice. He will leave his present post in September, although he will be replaced.Mr Flavell thinks his clinics will provide a number of benefits for patients and practices alike.He said: \u0026ldquoTwenty-five per cent of appointments at GP practices are for muscular skeletal problems. So, in theory, my physiotherapy clinics could help to take 25 per cent off the GP\u0026rsquos workload.\u0026ldquoAnd for people aged over 75, that figure goes up to 38 per cent, so I may be able to provide even more support.Kath Jones, NHS Highland\u0026rsquos associate medical director north and west, said: \u0026ldquoThree Caithness GP practices run by NHS Highland have recently attracted six new clinicians to permanent posts including three GPs, two ANPs and a physio practitioner.\u0026ldquoThe appointment of so many high-calibre clinicians within such a short time is a credit to the quality of the teams working in these practices. The recruitment of three GPs is particularly remarkable considering a quarter of GP practices across Scotland have vacancies.\u0026ldquoThe recruitment of all the clinicians will improve the continuity of care provided by the practices while introducing access to a specialist primary care physio at the three sites.\u0026ldquoReducing the reliance on temporary locums will enable NHS Highland to save money while improving care. With two of the clinicians moving into the district to take up post, this will be good for the local economy too.Mr Armer has already taken up his post at the practice on Janet Street, Thurso. Dr Carson is due to start in August and Dr Ruse in October.Vicki Kelly is to start her post at the Martha Terrace practice in Wick next week with Herjit Sutherland due to begin work at the end of August.Thursday 12 Jul 2018 1:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116297.jpg","title":"Sir Anthony Cleaver very pleased to see progress made by Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhile he says he is sad to be leaving his role as chairman of the partnership, he feels the time is right for a change. He will be succeeded by Ian Ross, the former East Sutherland and Edderton Highland councillor.Sir Anthony\u0026rsquos decision to step down ends a long association with the area which started in 1993 when he was appointed as chairman of the then UK Atomic Energy Authority. He later chaired AEA Technology and in 2004 took on the role of leading the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) which was responsible for decommissioning Dounreay.In 2008, the then local MP John Thurso asked Sir Anthony to chair Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership. He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges. That will always be the case.\u0026ldquoThe big advantage we have here is that it will be a number of years before Dounreay is closed so we had an opportunity to plan for the future. If it had been a car plant it would have been closed in three months.Sir Anthony highlights positive developments such as the improvements at Scrabster and Wick harbours as well as the pioneering MeyGen tidal energy project and the Beatrice offshore wind farm.The North Coast 500 is also making an impact and bringing economic opportunities to the area. The Nucleus archive across from Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport is another plus for Caithness, he adds. Sir Anthony played a part in bringing the facility to the county during his time as chairman of the NDA.Engineering and environmental courses at North Highland College UHI can also help regenerate the Caithness economy. \u0026ldquoThere are real opportunities here, he declared.Improving infrastructure and transport links in the far north are key to helping the area\u0026rsquos economy. Good schools and hospitals are another factor.\u0026ldquoI think the partnership has made a real contribution in the last 10 years, Sir Anthony said. \u0026ldquoWe have worked with other agencies to help create around 1000 jobs over that time but we all had to work together to do it. I am very pleased to see progress being made.Sir Anthony feels it is important to make Caithness as \u0026ldquoattractive as possible for people to come and work in the area.\u0026ldquoThere are still issues to be addressed but, overall, I think significant progress has been made. We played a part but it has always been a contributory role. The partnership is an enabler. The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor. I have had discussions with him and would be willing to help him in any way I can.Sir Anthony, who is 80, will keep a watchful eye on what is happening in Caithness and plans to stay active with his many other interests and hobbies. He enjoys opera, and swims five times a week.He started his career as a systems engineer with IBM in 1962 and went on to become its chief executive and chairman.Sir Anthony and his wife Jennie live in London and have a son, Paul, and a daughter, Caroline.Thursday 12 Jul 2018 1:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Subsea 7 order hailed as very good news for Caithness","story":"A MULTIMILLION-pound order that has been won by Subsea 7 and will create up to 130 jobs was described yesterday as \u0026ldquovery good news for Caithness.The company has been awarded a contract by Shell for a development at its Penguins field which lies 150 miles north east of Shetland.Subsea 7, which has yards at Wester and Hastigrow, will build two pipeline bundles in Caithness as part of the deal. One is 4.6 kilometres long and the other 2.7 kilometres.They will be used by Shell to develop the potential reserves in the Penguins field.Subsea7\u0026rsquos local site manager, Willie Watt, said: \u0026ldquoWe would be looking to make a start on this project by the autumn of next year and launch in the late spring of 2020.\u0026ldquoThis is very good news for the site and for Caithness. It is a testament to the capabilities of the people and the product that major companies keep coming back to us.The confirmation of the latest contract comes just months after Subsea 7 won an order from Statoil for its Snorre oil and gas field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. Its total value was said to be between \u0026pound150 million and \u0026pound300m.Work on that contract is expected to get under way in September with three launches due to be completed by November next year.The orders will see the company\u0026rsquos local workforce increase from around 30, at present, to up to 160.\u0026ldquoThis will give us continual work in Caithness until 2020, although there will be peaks and troughs along the way \u0026ndash but this is great news all round, Mr Watt added.Jonathan Tame, company vice president for the UK and Canada, said: \u0026ldquoWe are pleased to have the opportunity to bring our extensive expertise to a project of this importance.\u0026ldquoIn doing so it demonstrates Shell\u0026rsquos confidence in our value-adding solutions, and continues a successful North Sea collaboration that has been in place since 1984.The Penguins field was discovered in 1974 and first developed in 2002.The three pipeline bundles for Statoil will involve the largest diameter pipe assembled in the far north.The bulk of the fabrication will be done in Caithness, with design and project management work due to be undertaken at Subsea7\u0026rsquos premises in Aberdeen and at Stavanger in Norway.At the time that order was announced in December last year, Mr Watt said: \u0026ldquoIt is good to have Statoil back. The last bundle we did for them was in 2003.\u0026ldquoIt is an important project and shows pipeline bundles are the preference for developing the North Sea sector. It is the right product at the right time.The Statoil order will include pipeline bundles and control umbilicals required for the development.The Snorre field is sited within the Tampen area of the Norwegian North Sea.Since the last pipeline was launched in Caithness in March last year, the company has refurbished the rail track which is used to transport the bundles to the sea and on to the tugs before being taken to their destination.Thursday 12 Jul 2018 1:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116401.jpg","title":"Sunny conditions set to continue all week in Caithness","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCAITHNESS and other parts of the north are set to enjoy more dry and settled conditions under gin-blue skies coupled with virtually unbroken sunshine for the remainder of the week and beyond.On Sunday afternoon the air temperature in Wick peaked at 21.6C (70.9F).\u0026nbspLast Thursday morning the town witnessed a high of 22.5C (72.5F), making it the warmest day in the burgh for any day in June since 2011.The highest temperature recorded in Wick since 1910 is currently 26.7C (80.1F), witnessed on June 6, 1939.

Pupils at Wick High could also miss out on extracurricular activities, it was stated.At present, Stagecoach runs a service to Gills Bay three times a day, Monday to Saturday, but from next month it will operate twice a day, Monday to Friday. There are additional journeys between Wick and John O\u0026rsquoGroats but they vary according to school hours.A Stagecoach spokeswoman said the company recognised the feedback from the community over its plans. \u0026ldquoThe revised proposals represent a significant investment by Stagecoach, and work will continue to promote these links to encourage a sustainable level of demand. A review will take place 12 months after the start of the new timetable in order to establish the long term future of the bus service to Gills Bay.Trudy Morris, who chairs the Caithness Transport Forum, said: \u0026ldquoWe are very pleased to see that Stagecoach has listened to the local community and agreed to secure the bus link to Gills Bay for a further 12 months. Not only will this bring benefit to local bus users, who would otherwise be isolated in their communities, but it also has potential to benefit the tourist market, providing services to link with the Gills Bay ferry.However, she is concerned about the review in 12 months time and said: \u0026ldquoWe will be working with Stagecoach and the local community to see what can be done to promote usage of the route, and will also be discussing with public sector partners such as Highland Council to see what might be done to secure the route on a non-commercial basis in future.Bill Mowat, the chairman of Gills Harbour Ltd, claimed public pressure had an impact on Stagecoach and pointed out there was strong opposition to the plan.Thursday 12 Jul 2018 1:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July 12, 2018 at 6:00 amThis week\u0026#8217s paper is now available from all the usual outlets and online, here.

This could run into millions of pounds and put at risk the future viability of the business.The company have also met with local Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur, to express their concerns about the delay.As the start of this month, as Mr Matheson stepped into the shoes of the previous minister for transport Humza Yousaf, it was announced that lack of agreement between the Scottish Government and Pentland Ferries had led to no discounted fares being introduced in Pentland Firth ferry routes, by the Government\u0026#8217s self-set deadline of the end of last month.Andrew Banks, Managing Director and Owner of Pentland Ferries said: “We want these passenger subsidies implemented as soon as possible but we need to be 100 per cent sure that the scheme complies with state aid rules.  We have never had any subsidy from the government and even though this scheme gives money to the passenger, not the operator, the minister has told us that we would be liable for any repayment if at a future date the scheme is deemed illegal. This could run into the millions and could finish us off.“We cannot take that risk and we have a responsibility to our staff, our community and family to make sure the scheme works for everyone. We want to work with the Minister and his team to discuss a way forward so that we can all benefit from reduced fares. This scheme will be fantastic for our business, attracting more visitors to the islands and making it cheaper to travel to the mainland for residents. So we want this unlocked as soon as possible. We welcome the Minister’s willingness to gain a full understanding of the detail and very much hope to be able to meet him in Orkney soon.”The minister, Mr Matheson, was asked for a response to the comments from Pentland Ferries and Mr Banks. At the time he replied, Transport Scotland said the invitation had not yet been received so the minister could not comment.However, Mr Matheson did say: “The Scottish Government remains committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles. I am conscious that there is a great deal of interest in this issue amongst users of the services. As I begin my new role as Transport Secretary, I want to ensure that I gain a full understanding of the detail — it is already very clear to me that planning to introduce reduced fares on the Northern Isles network has been a complex and challenging piece of work.“As a first step, we will cut fares on the Aberdeen-Lerwick and Kirkwall-Lerwick services from June 30. These reductions will be around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.“On routes to Orkney, it has been necessary to engage with commercial operators on the Pentland Firth. We set out a very fair and reasonable proposal that would maintain competition, enabling them to protect their existing market share. Unfortunately, not all the commercial operators have felt able to agree to our proposals. This means we cannot currently implement reduced fares on any of the routes to and from Orkney without the risk of legal challenge.“This is both disappointing and frustrating, but I am determined to work through the issue to see what more can be done. I have asked Transport Scotland to undertake some further work to see what measures, if any, we can take. As part of that, we are willing to reopen talks with commercial operators.  I will provide a further update to stakeholders and to Parliament as soon as I can, with a view to bringing the full benefits of the scheme to the people of Orkney and Shetland.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It\u0026rsquos not an easy decision.\"We\u0026rsquove listened to customers, colleagues, communities and elected representatives and we continue to do so.\"We\u0026rsquove committed to making no further changes to the size of our branch network in Scotland until at least 2020 \u0026ndash and not to remove or replace, at a suitable nearby location, the branch ATM if there\u0026rsquos no other free-to-use ATM within 1km of the closing branch.\"The way our customers are banking is changing and it is important that we respond to that change. Across Scotland, usage of our branches is down 42 per cent since 2014. Only one per cent of our customers in Scotland visit their branch on a regular weekly basis. Seven in 10 customers are using mobile or online banking.\"\"We recognise that every customer will have different banking needs and we are committed to ensuring all our customers receive the best possible service.\"We\u0026rsquove invested to provide more ways to bank with us now than ever before.\"He added: \"We\u0026rsquove committed to keeping 10 branches open until the end of 2018.\"Johnston Carmichael has been appointed to carry out an independent review into these 10 branches and are meeting with local customers, representatives, employees and stakeholders in all ten communities to understand the impact of each individual closure.\"We have committed to accepting the recommendations of this review in full.\"Thursday 12 Jul 2018 1:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It is not clear why the paving moved but the extreme heat is suspected to be the cause.\"Meanwhile, emergency services were also called into action to tackle wildfires, including one in the Coulhill area of Alness on Tuesday.Firefighters were called to the scene of the 1000sqm blaze at around 10.30am, and remained on the scene for several hours before the fire was brought under control.And farmers in the area have voiced concerns that straw supplies could be set to run out amid the ongoing dry spell, with the National Farmers\u0026rsquo Union urging members to be proactive in negotiating reasonable prices.Thursday 12 Jul 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We had quite a lot of bad weather just after we started in January, and then we had to wait for the big spring tides so we could carry out a lot of the work.\"The jetty was in fairly poor shape as it had been there for more than 100 years and had spent the entire time being battered by the sea.\"We made the jetty wider and also lengthened it.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4767571.1531335462!/image/image.jpg","title":"kevan christie ex nurse freeman makes good start as health secretary","story":"        Scotland\u0026#8217s new Health Secretary appears to have got off to a flyer in terms of addressing the range of issues that weighed down her predecessor, Shona Robison, leading to her inevitable resignation and creating a siege mentalilty in the higher echelons of Holyrood.                 Jeane Freeman certainly brings a wealth of much-needed life experience and a degree of pragmatism to this most difficult of roles.            The former nurse has made all the right noises in terms of pledging to increase the speed at which the opaque health and social care services need to be brought together to address the country’s delayed-discharge problem – also known as bed-blocking – a nightmare that keeps people waiting in hospital when they’re fit enough to leave.            Here’s hoping she bangs a few bureaucratic heads together and manages to navigate through the coalition of local health boards and councils tasked with providing social care – a flagship idea from her own government built on an integration pipe dream. Good luck with that one Jeane. READ MORE: Nicola Sturgeon pays tribute to NHS staff as health service marks 70 yearsHowever, what may prove even more difficult for the nascent Cabinet Secretary is her vow to cut waiting times – a weekly Groundhog Day for Robison that proved to be her Achilles’ heel. A\u0026ampE waiting-time targets have been missed for a ninth month in a row and bed-blocking has risen eight per cent in a year. And those problems make up the tip of an iceberg that also includes almost 500 cancelled operations in May alone due to a lack of hospital capacity, an ongoing GP recruitment crisis and cancer treatment waiting times at their worst level in six years. Hopefully, Freeman doesn’t fall into the trap set by the Scottish Government’s own Information Services Division, which brings out a fresh raft of statistics every Tuesday to the delight of opposition parties who are provided with their weekly open goal. The early signs are that the new Health Secretary has no difficulty acknowledging there are problems in providing free healthcare to an ageing population and this is to be welcomed.             A situation developed over the course of Robison’s tenure in which the media would (over) report on the latest missed waiting time target, the likes of Scottish Labour’s Anas Sarwar would call for her head, and the under-fire Health Secretary would ignore the problem. Instead she would tell us, again, how much her Government had spent on improving the nation’s health. READ MORE: 500 operations cancelled due to ‘non-clinical’ reasonsNotable figures like the chair of the BMA in Scotland, Dr Peter Bennie, and a former chief medical officer, Sir Harry Burns, have consistently argued that waiting-time figures should be scrapped and are counter-productive to providing the best healthcare. This was blatantly ignored by Robsion and her Cabinet colleagues who developed the frankly annoying habit of constantly comparing statistics in Scotland to the rest of the UK, most notably England, in a politicisation of the health service that isn’t helpful to someone waiting 37 weeks for a knee replacement.  I may be over-optimistic but if Freeman can bring her own stamp of authority to the job and tackle critics head-on, while admitting problems exist, then we may be moving forward. The first publication of the monthly financial performance of all NHS health boards is an encouraging move towards greater transparency and Scotland’s GPs are on record as saying Freeman can help rebuild general practice. So, the goodwill appears to be there and the current mood music is favourable – let’s hope it lasts."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4767570.1531335460!/image/image.jpg","title":"tom peterkin honour of carrington contrasts with boris s ambition","story":"        The late Lord Carrington set an example that modern politicians would do well to follow, writes Tom Peterkin.                There was a fearful symmetry about the passing of Lord Carrington at a time when the British body politic is still reeling from the resignation of one of his successors as Foreign Secretary.            On the most superficial level, the late Lord Carrington and Boris Johnson would appear to have quite a bit in common.            When Mr Johnson quit on Monday, he became the first Foreign Secretary to resign since Lord Carrington left Margaret Thatcher’s Government over the invasion of the Falklands by Argentina in 1982. And on that same day, by a strange coincidence, Lord Carrington died at the age of 99.Both men, it could be said, come from traditional Tory backgrounds with Mr Johnson, an old Etonian and a product of Oxford University and the Bullingdon Club. Also an Etonian, Lord Carrington’s background looks distinctly anachronistic by today’s standards. But it was not that unusual in a bygone political era. He was a hereditary peer, who was never elected yet held some of the great offices of state. Both men, like many politicians, could be charm – even panache – itself. Although Mr Johnson’s unique breed of charm, based on oafish buffoonery, seems to have lost some of the lustre that made him such a draw on the Have I Got News for You circuit.But, the closer one looks at the two characters, the similarities are harder to find. The contrasts become more evident and are not greatly to Mr Johnson’s credit.            Yesterday’s fulsome obituaries of Lord Carrington recalled a patrician, paternalistic old-school “One Nation” Tory.READ MORE: Lord Carrington, who resigned over the Falklands, has died aged 99Unlike Mr Johnson’s gaffe-laden courting of celebrity and love of a photo opportunity, Lord Carrington was reticent to a fault when it came to self-promotion.He was so self-effacing that when writing his memoirs he didn’t bother to mention that he had won a Military Cross in the Second World War. Some thought it should have been a Victoria Cross. But when asked in an interview how he won it his answer was “pot luck”.            As a civilian member of a post-war generation, Mr Johnson has never had the chance to win a military decoration. But while Lord Carrington drove a tank on to a bridge over the Rhine and held the enemy at enormous personal risk, Mr Johnson is known for being filmed stranded on a zip-wire. They may have both resigned as Foreign Secretary, but the circumstances surrounding their departures could hardly be more different. Lord Carrington resigned as Foreign Secretary three days after Argentina invaded the Falklands. He felt he had no option other than to go, taking responsibility for the Foreign Office’s collective failure to foresee that trouble was on its way. “The nation feels there has been a disgrace,” he wrote in his memoirs. “Somebody must have been to blame. The disgrace must be purged. The person to purge it should be the minister in charge. That was me.”Despite Mrs Thatcher trying to persuade him not to go, he went and, to this day, it is seen as the act of an honourable man.            READ MORE: UK Government to start stockpiling food for no-deal BrexitHistory, one suspects, will not judge Mr Johnson quite so kindly. Given his ability to conjure up a memorable turn of phrase, it was no surprise that his resignation letter was a classic of its kind.In it, he complained that Brexit was “dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt”.Needless self-doubt is not something that has troubled Mr Johnson when it comes to his own ambition and it is difficult to escape the impression that his decision to quit was all about him. In fact, it would appear almost every political move he makes is all about him.The former Foreign Secretary’s critics believe his decision to embrace the Brexit cause before the 2016 EU referendum was more to do with his own Tory leadership ambitions than any matter of principle.Similarly, those self-same critics believe his departure to be driven by exactly the same motive – his own desire to end up in Number 10 Downing Street.Mrs May had installed Mr Johnson in one of the most crucial posts in her Cabinet on the basis that, as a Brexiteer, he should shoulder his share of the heavy lifting in these difficult times.In fact, Mr Johnson was more of a hindrance than a help – a disruptive influence at a time when politicians should be pulling together. In the world of Boris, as soon as David Davis leapt off Mrs May’s increasingly precarious ship, he had little option but to do likewise.Had Mr Davis been the only Cabinet minister to disembark that would have made him the only figurehead for disaffected Tory MPs to rally round and mount a challenge to Mrs May. Had Mr Johnson stayed in the Cabinet and been bound by collective responsibility (inasmuch as Boris Johnson can ever be bound by collective responsibility), Mr Davis would be given a free run when it came to stirring up trouble for the Prime Minister.Now Mr Johnson also lurks on the sidelines making himself a focal point for Tory dissatisfaction with the current leadership. We will never know how Lord Carrington would have viewed this state of affairs. But he did once say: “I had no desire whatsoever to lead the party – nor ever had.”Were Mr Johnson to say something similar, one suspects it would not bear much relation to the truth."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765629.1531383518!/image/image.jpg","title":"poll half of scots oppose second independence referendum","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

Masked men hijacked and torched vehicles in and around Belfast amid loyalist anger about moves to reduce the size of two loyalist Eleventh Night bonfires, while in Londonderry republican youths engaged in a fifth successive night of disorder in the Bogside area, throwing petrol bombs at police.            Police Service of Northern Ireland Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd condemned those involved.            “The disorder we have seen has been caused by a small minority of people who have no regard for their communities,” he said.The deal between Orangemen and nationalist residents over arguably the most contentious parade - past the nationalist Ardoyne community in north Belfast - ensured that event again proceeded without incident on Thursday morning.READ MORE: DUP leader rails against sectarianism in Orange Order speechThat was one of around 600 feeder parades taking place across Northern Ireland, with Orange members and supporting loyalist bands congregating at 17 host venues for events to mark the 1690 victory of Protestant King William of Orange over Catholic King James II at the Battle of the Boyne.It is the biggest date in the Protestant loyal order parading calendar.            On Wednesday night, 13 vehicles were set on fire in Belfast and surrounding towns.A suspected pipe bomb also detonated close to a police operation to clear a contentious fire site in Belfast while other security alerts prompted the closure of main roads, with one incident preventing newly arrived passengers exiting Belfast City Airport.Masked men also used burning cars to block roads close to the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald on the outskirts of Belfast, while a bus with passengers on board was hijacked before being set alight in nearby Newtownards.Wednesday’s incidents unfolded amid a police warning that the loyalist paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) was planning to “orchestrate and participate in serious disorder” in east Belfast.            The violence came after loyalists expressed anger at moves by the authorities to limit the size of bonfires at two controversial sites in the east of the city.Hundreds of Eleventh Night bonfires were lit at midnight across Northern Ireland to usher in the Twelfth commemorations.By 1am on Thursday, the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS) had received a total of 327 emergency calls, mobilised to 164 operational incidents - 57 of which were bonfire-related.READ MORE: Church calls for Orange Walk rethink after Priest attackFire officers said the figures represented a 23% increase on incidents attended last year, with the regional control centre at times handling an emergency 999 call every 48 seconds.

Conservative Brexiteers have staged a parliamentary assault Theresa May\u0026#8217s Brexit plans, lodging wrecking amendments to the government\u0026#8217s Trade Bill in a bid to keep up the pressure on the Prime Minister.                It comes as ministers prepare to publish a long-awaited white paper on the UK’s future relationship with the EU, revealing the detail of how Mrs May plans trade and customs to work after Brexit.            Amendments lodged by the head of the European Research Group of pro-Brexit backbenchers and supported by MPs including the Scottish Conservative Ross Thomson would block the government from keeping one foot in the EU customs union for goods, and prevent a proposed ‘backstop’ solution for the Irish border from creating an internal trade boundary in the Irish Sea.            The amendments are unlikely to pass, but will send a message to government whips amid claims that more ministers could follow Boris Johnson and David Davis in resigning over Mrs May’s plan.Meanwhile, it was revealed that government preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit include stockpiling processed food in case shipments are held up at the border.In a even more dramatic contingency plan, reports suggest the government is preparing to airlift electric generators from military bases in Afghanistan and float them on barges around the Northern Irish coast if electricity supplies from the Republic are cut off.In his first parliamentary duties since being appointed to replace Mr Davis as Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab will insist the White Paper “respects the result of the referendum, and delivers a principled and practical Brexit.”Unveiling the 120-page document, Mr Raab is expected to tell MPs: “This is the right approach - for both the UK and for the EU. The White Paper sets out in detail how it would work.”            On Tuesday night, Conservative MP Andrea Jenkyns, said it was time to “put country first” and warned the Prime Minister that “there will no doubt be more resignations from Brexiteers in the Cabinet” if further concessions were made to the EU.In another sign of the deepening rift in the Conservative Party, Stewart Jackson, Mr Davis’ former special adviser at the Brexit department, claimed Number 10 had blocked his reappointment.Asked at the Nato summit in Brussels yesterday if she expected more resignations from the government, Mrs May insisted that her plan delivered on the Brexit “red lines” she has set out.“It delivers on the vote that people gave on Brexit, it delivers the fact that we will have an end to free movement, we will have an end to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK, we won’t be sending vast contributions to the EU every year, we’ll be out of the Common Agricultural Policy, out of the Common Fisheries Policy,” she said.            “We deliver that Brexit and we do it in a way that protects jobs and livelihoods and meets our commitment to Northern Ireland.”Meanwhile, the SNP demanded a seasonal agricultural workers programme to replace dwindling numbers of EU fruit-pickers amid reports that tonnes of soft fruit has been left to rot by Scottish producers in recent weeks.

The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"more seabirds entangled but fishing industry not always to blame says tour guide ","story":"\nDarron Smith cuts free a gannet.

It could be the nets have snagged on the bottom. There could be a wreck and they\u0026#8217ve torn their net, and the net has come clear.\u0026#8221It\u0026#8217s not his fault if he\u0026#8217s lost a bit of his net.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 19 ","story":"Shetland’s young sports competitors retained their hold on the Stuart Cup at the weekend, with the margin of victory, in the end, being fairly comfortable.\nGoing into the last event of the junior inter-county, the netball, Orkney had to win by 32 points to overhaul the visitors’ lead. Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another.

A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

Our website is up to date with the latest information.”\nUnite regional officer Wullie Wallace expected talks with Acas next week. The dispute is over pay for airport workers. A total of 88 per cent of workers rejected the latest pay offer.\nThe union said members had rejected two below-inflation wage offers on the back of below inflation increases over the last two years.\nMr Wallace said: \u0026#8220Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members.

room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nThursday 12 Jul 2018 1:38 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/advert_whfp.jpg","title":"former sabhal mor ostaig chairman","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nFormer Sabhal Mòr Ostaig chair Duncan MacQuarrie was celebrated this week with the first road in the new Kilbeg Village development, Rathad MhicGuaire (MacQuarrie Road) named in his honour during an official ceremony held on Monday.\nThe ceremony was carried out by Kate Forbes MSP and recognised the key role which Mr MacQuarrie has played in the college\u0026#8217s development over many years. Sabhal Mòr Ostaig principal Prof Boyd Robertson said, \u0026#8220This is a richly-deserved honour for Duncan which recognises the hugely important contribution he has made to the development of the college over many years and the vital contribution he has made to the development of the Gaelic language and culture and to the advancement of Gaelic and Gaelic-medium education, both as a teacher and as a former HM Inspector.”\n“Duncan\u0026#8217s critical input to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig’s development in its challenging formative years was marked by his steady stewardship, as a former chairman and his pioneering work, alongside that of his fellow trustees, demonstrated an exemplary vision and commitment without which what is now the National Centre for the Gaelic Language and Culture would not have existed.”\n“For that, all who have benefited from this wonderful and inspiring place, over the intervening years, owe him a great debt of gratitude and it is for that reason we celebrate with him here today.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve.
