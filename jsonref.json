They are anything but a celebration of national music, like so many lesser festivals.Those eccentrics with their little rituals whom viewers always see at the front of the Last Night crowd are very serious about their music.I have interviewed a few of them over the years. They are an eclectic bunch but the last thing you can accuse them of is jingoism. They might sing Rule Britannia with gusto but they will have been just as enthusiastic for the French, African, Indian – even Finnish – music at other concerts over the season.Besides, Rule Britannia has nothing to do with \u0027enslavement\u0027 as its critics claim. Indeed, the words are an exhortation, not a triumphalist boast. Note that the words say \u0027Britannia, rule the waves\u0027 – not \u0027rules\u0027.The song was written for an 18th-century royal masque about Alfred the Great defeating the Vikings. It acquired its popularity not as a military marching tune, like, say, France\u0027s unashamedly brutal Marseillaise, but as a catchy musical number sung by barmaid-turned-West End star, Kitty Clive. In other words, it\u0027s a Georgian X-Factor hit. It then went on to be a favourite tune of the Royal Navy – the same navy, of course, which abolished slavery.Similarly, Elgar\u0027s Land of Hope and Glory was called no such thing when it was first performed at the Proms in 1901 – because Arthur Benson had not yet got round to writing any words. It was just Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1.These songs have never been imposed on the British public – like a national anthem or school song – but they endure through their universal appeal. The Germans, Brazilians and Japanese whom I have seen singing \u0027Rule Britannia\u0027 at the Royal Albert Hall, while waving their EU flags, had no more enthusiasm for British imperialism than Dalia Stasevska, Jeremy Corbyn or Karl Marx\u0027s cat. Like all the other Prommers, they were there for the music and for the occasion.It is often said that the BBC is far too sensitive to the prevailing wind on Twitter. So the Broadcasting House high-ups must have been mortified to see that the most popular Twitter thread yesterday lunchtime was \u0027#DefundtheBBC\u0027 followed closely by \u0027#RuleBritannia\u0027. Then, the Prime Minister weighed in for the second day running, accusing the BBC of \u0027cringing\u0027 and \u0027wetness\u0027.They need not cringe. Rather, they should point out that it was the BBC which saved the Proms from insolvency in 1927 and which has kept it all going ever since with generations of great musicians, conductors and presenters. Then they should tell their critics on both sides to pipe down and enjoy the music.But perhaps, we should have seen this coming. For last year\u0027s Last Night, the BBC commissioned a new work to open the concert. It was entitled, simply, \u0027Woke\u0027. "},{"url":null,"title":"Half entries Scots Wikipedia revealed work teen doesnt speak language","story":"Share this articleI’ve discovered that almost every single article on the Scots version of Wikipedia is written by the same person - an American teenager who can’t speak Scots : Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"Matt Hancock attributes summer tan Cornwall surfing staycation","story":"Share this article He subsequently explained his actions in a tweet as he said: \u0027I cancelled our family holiday abroad this year to focus on the challenges COVID-19 created for the education sector. \u0027Over the summer, I went to see family in Scarborough for the first time since lockdown, and while there I was in constant communication with the Department.  Gillian Keegan, an education minister, was also criticised after sharing photographs of herself in France as the results drama unfolded.And last month Transport Secretary Grant Shapps arrived in Spain on the same day that he and other key Cabinet ministers decided to impose quarantine measures on those returning from the European country following a spike in Covid-19 cases.The former Tory chairman cut his break short and had to work from home as part of his 14 days of self-isolation upon his return. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3970942d22b2bfd3d567bfae1b7046d6c06d3c6/0_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a9e66c792a9278580b436fb16362c704","title":"va dundee exposes scottish design icons slavery links","story":"Reassessment of collection highlights how many industries profited from British colonialismScotland’s newest museum, the V\u0026ampA Dundee, has started challenging the cherished status of some of the country’s design icons, exposing their links to slavery, colonial wars and cultural appropriation.In a reassessment of its collection before its reopening this week, V\u0026ampA Dundee has updated its Scottish design gallery to show how many of the country’s most famous industries profited from British colonisation of much of the globe.It includes the Paisley pattern that uses mango and teardrop-shaped motifs. V\u0026ampA Dundee now tells visitors these were Kashmiri and Persian designs appropriated by Scottish firms and sold back to south Asian consumers at prices that undercut local producers.Factories in the Vale of Leven near Glasgow profited from the production of bright and long-lasting Turkey Red fabrics for sale in India, without telling Hindu consumers they used bullocks’ blood during the dyeing process, which was against their religious beliefs.Rewritten labels and gallery panels also link a Scottish architect’s design for the Cathedral Church of All Saints in Khartoum with Sudan’s “violent conquest” by British-led forces, and an elaborately embroidered glengarry military bonnet from India with colonial Indian regiments. Another explains how Scottish tea planters, jute mill owners and shipping magnates profited through the East India Company.The V\u0026ampA Dundee disclosed its decolonisation programme in time for its reopening on Thursday, five months after it was closed due to the coronavirus pandemic. It is running the V\u0026ampA’s blockbuster exhibition on the 1960s fashion designer Mary Quant.Sophie McKinlay, the V\u0026ampA Dundee’s programmes director, said the work involved consulting experts from the universities of St Andrews and Dundee, and developing new programmes to bring in artists, curators and specialists to expand its work on decolonisation, class and local communities.“If we can view these historic objects through a contemporary lens, that is the key to understanding design. You can only unlock those stories by really understanding the history but also understanding their relevance today.”McKinlay said the museum was “acutely conscious” of its need to bring in minority ethnic experts, curators and artists. “There’s a longer-term commitment that this absolutely cannot be a hollow gesture that this needs to be backed up by systemic change.”Under its director, Tristram Hunt, the V\u0026ampA Museum has also re-evaluated its work and collections in parallel with the Black Lives Matter movement and a sector-wide reappraisal of how European museums built their collections after colonising, exploiting or subjugating other countries during the colonial era.The V\u0026ampA Museum, whose collection is significantly larger than that of its Dundee outpost, is not relabelling its exhibits but has set up an anti-racism taskforce to ensure its next five-year work programme is underpinned by “ersity, equality and inclusion”.The museum has put on new displays to identify its set of Asante goldweights – copper alloy weights seized by British troops in a raid on Kumase, in what is now Ghana, in 1874 – as the product of imperial conquest. Another uses gold and silver pieces to explore Nazi looting through the stories of eight Jewish collectors and their families.V\u0026ampA Dundee’s initiative follows a recent re-evaluation of Scotland’s integral role in the British empire and its enrichment from the Atlantic slave trade and plantations in the Americas.Duncan Dornan, the head of museums with Glasgow Life, which runs the city’s major museums, said it had hired a new curator, who starts work in September, to lead its work on decolonisation and to expand its programmes with the city’s minority ethnic residents.Other initiatives include a new display at its Riverside transport museum on the role of Glaswegian shipbuilders who sold dozens of steamships to the Confederate rebel army to break blockades during the US civil war.Last year Glasgow University pledged £20m for a research project with the University of the West Indies after a study estimated it had benefited financially by up to £198m from slave trade receipts in the 18th and 19th centuries.Plans are being drafted for a museum of slavery that will explore Scotland’s ties to the trade and plantations economy.Jute bagsBefore: Dundee became famous as Juteopolis because it made so many jute sacks and goods, and “Dundee’s shipyards built the ships that imported raw jute fibre from south Asia”.Now: “Dundee-built ships brought the raw fibre to the city from Bengal, where it was grown by peasants, or ryots, in the Ganges river delta.”The Paisley patternBefore: The designs “proved so successful that their characteristic teardrop or pine cone pattern became known around the world as ‘Paisley’.”Now: “Paisley shawls became so successful that their characteristic mango, teardrop or pinecone shaped motif, known in Kashmir and Persia as buta, became known in the west as the ‘Paisley pattern’.”Turkey Red fabricsBefore: Factories in the Vale of Leven used long-lasting bright red dyes which “often incorporated Asian motifs and were particularly popular with Indian markets.”Now: “Hindu consumers were not aware that during the dyeing process madder root extract was combined with bullocks’ blood, which was against their religious beliefs.”Glengarry bonnetBefore: This finely embroidered cap emerged after “Scottish regiments were deployed across India, and in 1848 the Ludhiana Sikh Regiment adopted the Glengarry as its uniform cap”.Now: “Following the first Anglo-Sikh war, the newly formed Regiment of Ludhiana, which included colonised Indian soldiers, adopted the Glengarry as its uniform cap. Is this a sign of cultural exchange or subjugation?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8dcdba061bcc4b105b682ba61814f740807bddd/0_700_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8eaec064a2b44cfab546d9d13684e439","title":"americans and their dreams in pictures","story":"In his new book American Dreams, the Canadian photographer Ian Brown has collected 170 portraits of Americans along with handwritten statements of what the American dream means to them.

As he travelled from court to court, Hainhofer would ask dignitaries to paint in his album amicorum, or friendship book, also known as a stammbuch. There are around 25,000 historic friendship books recorded around the world, but Hainhofer’s Großes Stammbuch is considered the most impressive, containing signatures by European figures including Cosimo De’ Medici, the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II and Christian IV, the king of Denmark and Norway. Each inidual would commission an artist to create a painting accompanying their signatures. There are around 100 drawings in the book, which took more than 50 years to compile.When Hainhofer, who helped set up the Herzog August library, died in 1647, Duke August tried to acquire the book for his library but was unsuccessful.The album went became privately owned and was withdrawn from the public domain. It was even considered to be lost, until it resurfaced at a London auction in 1931. But 373 years after Duke August made his first attempt to buy it, the book has finally made its way to the shelves of the Herzog August Bibliothek, after it was offered to Sotheby’s for private sale last year. Researchers at the auction house uncovered its connection to the library, and arranged a private sale for around €2.8m (£2.5m).Sotheby’s called Das Großes Stammbuch “extraordinary” and said it was one of the most important examples of a friendship book. “No other work of art better reflects the deeply challenging political tensions that were being navigated in Europe at this time,” the auction house said.Björn Thümler, minister for science and culture in Niedersachsen, which is home to the library, called the acquisition “a sensation and a stroke of luck for the preservation of cultural assets in Germany”.Herzog August director Peter Burschel said the acquisition, financed by bodies including the Cultural Foundation of the Federal States (Kulturstiftung der Länder), was the most important the library had made since it bought the medieval manuscript Gospels of Henry the Lion at auction in 1983 for £8.1m.“It provides unparalleled insights into the early modern political culture of trade and commerce in art,” said Burschel of the book, adding that the library is planning exhibitions of the manuscript to make it accessible to the public."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9a5527ed8e46c7a2f669736644596caa496238f/0_166_5757_3454/master/5757.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bceed1cc6320739c6c69e10f7dae0f21","title":"businesses and customers share your experiences of eat out to help out","story":"We’d like to hear to from staff, owners and customers on how they feel the scheme has beenThe government’s ‘eat out to help out’ scheme has meant more than 64m meals have been claimed since the beginning of August.When introduced, its aim was to incentivise the public to dine at restaurants by allowing customers to claim a half-price discount up to a cost of £10.

Flutter’s chief executive, Peter Jackson, lauded a performance that resulted in the enlarged firm brushing off the effect of the pandemic lockdown, which led to cancelled or postponed sports events and the closure of its network of high street bookmakers in the UK and Ireland.Jackson said the impact of the pandemic on sport was “more than offset by an increase in the number of recreational customers playing our poker and gaming products globally, as people sought new forms of home entertainment”.The group managed to increase revenue from sports betting in the US and Australia, where horse racing has continued during the pandemic and enjoyed greater television prominence as other sports stopped.Analysts at the stockbroker Jefferies described Flutter’s performance as “another upbeat gambling sector update”, with the rise of online poker and casino games largely cushioning the blow of the pandemic for the industry.The merger with The Stars Group has increased the company’s spread across regions and forms of gambling, particularly poker.Jackson said Flutter was in good shape coming out of lockdown, as the online gaming customers picked up during lockdown appear to have stuck with the company, while sports revenue had returned as sports such as football pick up where they left off.“Looking ahead, we have identified promising opportunities to increase investment across the group and, while the outlook with respect to Covid-19 remains highly uncertain, the ersification of our group means we approach the future with confidence,” Jackson said.The group has also built a promising business in the US market, which has been rapidly expanding after sports betting regulations were relaxed.

The amount of time a home is put up for sale before it finds a buyer has fallen to just 27 days since restrictions were eased, compared to 39 days over the same period in 2019.Big homes in the countryside are shifting fastest, while urban flats typically aimed at first-time buyers are now the slowest market segment.The robust property market is in sharp contrast to the state of the UK economy, which contracted far more than that of any other developed country in the second quarter of 2020, according to figures from the OECD. Richard Donnell of Zoopla said: “The ‘once in a lifetime’ re-evalution of housing requirements on the back of the lockdown is a counterweight to the impact of the recession on the UK housing market.”The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on Wednesday issued fresh guidance to mortgage lenders, telling them to extend forebearance to householders who are coming to the end of their payment holiday but are still in financial distress.Around two million people have taken a mortgage holiday since the pandemic began, equal to around one in six of all mortgages in the UK. Applications under the mortgage holiday scheme can be made until 31 October.Charlotte Nixon, mortgage expert at Quilter Financial Planning, said: “Assuming that the payment holidays are not extended past October, the guidance is clear that the onus is still very much on lenders to help customers get through this difficult period.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e38967f30607bbeeb13f8572c85c1fc696dbe62/0_201_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db630142ed70a794ae54c33ad1ca96e2","title":"wpp reveals only 3 of uk staff regularly work from office","story":"Figures highlight numbers still working from home during coronavirus pandemicThe world’s biggest employer in the marketing and advertising sector, which has clients ning Ford to Facebook, has a workforce of about 10,000 in the UK.WPP revealed on Wednesday that just 300 staff are working in its British offices, as the company takes a cautious approach to health and safety and embraces the homeworking revolution.The new data underscore the challenge facing Boris Johnson, who is desperate to get people back to work to help reignite spending in towns and cities.“The costs of office closures are becoming clearer by the day,” said Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry. “Some of our busiest city centres resemble ghost towns, missing the usual bustle of passing trade.

Ashworth said:The policy is deliberately vague, however, with Powell not clarifying exactly how high inflation would need to get before FOMC officials did become uncomfortable.In another major change, the Fed will now interpret its maximum employment goal as a “broad-based and inclusive goal”, which suggests that rather than focusing solely on the aggregate unemployment rate, officials will also explicitly take into account how low-income and minority labour market participants are faring. But where exactly is this inflation going to come from? Neil Williams, a senior economic adviser to Federated Hermes, said:Chair Powell’s comments formalise what the Fed has been doing for 18 months, and confirm his frustration that better growth doesn’t necessarily mean an inflation lift-off. Inflation is set to rise, but, it’ll be the ‘wrong sort’ – driven more by shortages and cost factors, rather than demand. Without wage acceleration, this could snuff itself out – meaning, with or without his change today – Fed rate tightening may remain yesterday’s challenge.Jerome Powell has now finished speaking. And just as he does the Dow Jones industrial average turns positive for the year - a symbol of the support that he and the central bank have given to equity markets since the pandemic began.Candice Bangsund, vice president and portfolio manager at Fiera Capital, said:This more relaxed view on inflation will reinforce the notion that rates will remain pinned at these rock-bottom levels for an extended time – which will be instrumental in guiding the economy back to health and acting as a key source of support for risky assets in general. Indeed, the subsequent output gap and the elevated level of unemployment stemming from the economic stop in March and April will keep inflation pinned lower and allow central banks to pursue extremely accommodative monetary policies for the foreseeable future, with the end result being a strong, above-trend growth cycle that will follow for the next several years as the central bank focusses on closing that gap in the economy. In this lucrative environment, it is likely that equities will make new highs over that timeframe.Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton, said:If we can keep the disease under control we can help the economy to recover, Powell says.But we need to support workers in sectors that are most affected, Powell says. There might be “stop and starts “ in general recovery, but there could be a “long tail” of people who are left out for at least a couple of years, he says.Some responses from economists and commentators:Powell has been asked what the Fed can do to help racial equality.The effects of the pandemic have fallen to a large extent on service jobs with low wages, and this is heavily skewed towards women and minorities, Powell says.The single most important thing we can do here is support a strong labour market, Powell says, but that is an all-governmental, society project.But there are better tools from elected officials to address racial inequalities. He said:We really need it to be broader than just the Fed.The new policy does not dictate particular outcomes, Powell says.It’s part of a broad programme to “aggressively seek” transparency and accountability, Powell says.The new approach is not new among central banks (just look at the Bank of England and the European Central Bank) but it does mean that the Fed faces a political battle to sell it against hawks.They aren’t huge moves, but stock markets on Wall Street have opened at new record highs.Q: On the new average inflation targeting strategy, how will this be communicated and how will it change things?Public communications are very important, Powell says.We’re talking about “moderate” overshoots, not “permanent or for sustained periods of time”, he says. This is not a formulaic approach.I think it is the approopriate solution, he says. Undershoots of inflation are not frogotten but are made up later.Powell says the central bank will engage in regular reviews of monetary policy roughly every five years, and with that he is finished - but there is a Q\u0026ampA coming up (via a rickety connection with the questioner).It is a robust updating of our monetary policy framework, Powell says.The bank will be highly focused on fostering as strong as labour market as possible for all Americans, as well as steady inflation over time.To counter the risks of running out of firepower the bank is prepared to use the full range of tools, Powell says.A robust job market can be sustained without an increase in inflation, Powell says - unlike in the past.And it looks like equities are getting a boost.The dollar is weakening as Powell speaks (with a dovish message so far).Longer-term inflation expectations may have been holding down inflation more than expected, Powell says.Persistently low inflation is a “cause for concern”. It can cause a serious risk for the economy and a “adverse cycle” of ever lower inflation expectations.This would give less scope for cutting interest rates in a downturn.Once it sets in it can be very difficult to overcome, and the central bank wants to prevent it happening in the US, he says (perhaps a reference to Japan’s experience).There have been four main developments in understanding of monetary policy, Powell says:Inflation targeting has had an emphasis on transparency, showing the understanding that public communication is important for monetary policy, Powell says.Powell is summarising the development of the inflation targeting regime through previous chairs.A 2012 update was a “significant milestone”, but it happened early on in the recovery from the financial crisis, but the understanding of monetary policy has developed since then.The central bank has published details of the new framework which he will discuss.Much more to follow on the speech.Jerome Powell will be starting in less than 10 minutes.You can watch an introduction followed by his speech live here:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6ec8063eec077501f774cfeaf27881cd3453192/452_391_2537_1522/master/2537.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2eb37acc6db79deac197273c79676f65","title":"teachers and parents across the uk share your thoughts on the reopening of schools","story":"We’d like to hear from people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland about returning to schools, and those in Scotland about how it has beenWith just weeks to go until children return to school in England and Wales, and less than a week until the first cohort of students in Northern Ireland return for the start of the new academic year, protective measures in schools remain fiercely contested.Many teachers have criticised the government’s ‘bubble’ group scheme and social distancing measures, while some unions have called for teachers to be able to choose to use face coverings, against government advice.We’d like to hear from teachers and parents about how they are preparing for the reopening of schools, and how they are feeling about it.If you are in Scotland, where schools are already open full-time, we’d also like to hear how it has been so far.We are particularly interested in hearing from parents about whether they will be sending their children back to school, and how they feel about possible fines for not doing so.You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish.

She was relieved when the school district announced in July it would start the school year online. “I just don’t think we’re at that point where it’s safe for our children to go back to school,” Ruiz said.There are more than 55 million students attending over 130,000 schools in the US. With the Covid-19 pandemic ravaging many parts of the country, killing more than 170,000 people in the last five months, how and if schools should reopen to students or switch to virtual learning has been a months-long debate that has largely not seen any resolution.The US is far from being the first country to grapple with reopening its schools. But the spread of Covid-19 has been far more severe in the US than these countries that have opened their classrooms again. Though epidemiologists largely agree that young children do not see the virus’ worst effects, less is known about the risk children pose to adults.With the school year starting after a pandemic summer, policymakers and school leaders have had to use uncertain information about how kids spread the virus to take decisive action. The result has been a patchwork of policies and protocols that vary from state to state and can even differ between neighboring school districts.This patchwork method is something that epidemiologists, including Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, have said is necessary given the size of the country and the varying effects the virus has had in it.“We live in a big country that is very heterogeneous with regard to the level of virus. You’ve got to look at what is going on in the community,” Fauci said in a recent talk with George Washington University,.It sounds simple: Schools in communities with higher community spread should take extra precautions, even consider online-only learning, until transmissions taper down. Areas with lower spreads can reopen with a little more freedom.But the problem is that states and local school districts around the US have reopened or have plans to reopen in communities that have higher rates of transmission. And in areas where transmission is lower, schools often lack the funding and time to implement even the most basic safety protocols, like controlling air ventilation in classrooms.The result has been a mess. Teachers have gone on strikes to shut down schools amid safety concerns. Photos of maskless high school students in Georgia went viral and were followed with reports of outbreaks in those schools. Parents have been asked to make what feel like life or death decisions amid the confusion.To circumvent mounting concerns about the inadequacy of potential safety protocols, along with higher transmission rates in some communities, many school districts, including some of the largest in the US, are starting the year with online-only classes.The move has been both a relief and a cause of great stress for many teachers and parents. Online learning puts the likelihood of community outbreaks at zero, which eases communities that have dealt with the worst of the virus. But switching to online classes in the spring has shown teachers and parents that virtual learning comes with many setbacks.For many parents, a pressing concern is how they can both monitor their childrens’ online learning while also working full-time.Lorraine Quinones, a mother of three and a teacher at an elementary school in Los Angeles, feels fortunate that, though she has to be live with her students for most of the school day, she has a 17-year-old who can help her six-year-old with virtual learning, and her nine-year-old is able to navigate it on her own.“Unfortunately my kids are going to have to be on their own in a sense, which is heartbreaking as a mother,” Quinones said.Meanwhile, Lauren Kullman, a theater teacher for students in pre-kindergarten to eighth grade in Chicago, does not know how she is going to manage teaching live online classes while taking care of her children, who are five and two. While Kullman, who is immunocompromised, is grateful that Chicago public schools decided to start the year virtually, she is obligated to teach multiple live classes a day when she will be unable to care for her children. The plan is to give both kids walkie-talkies in case they need her or her husband, who is also a teacher.“It doesn’t seem like there’s grace being afforded to teachers, it feels much more like well this is what you wanted, so now this is what you gotta do,” Kullman said. “I have to have people in power see me as a human, not as a teacher bot.”Virtual learning has also come under criticism from child development experts, who note that it is ineffective for young children without active parent involvement. For kids of all ages, including high school students, the school setting is also essential for social and emotional well-being. The National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NAS) and the American Academy of Pediatrics strongly advised that policymakers prioritize reopening schools given how important they are for wellbeing and development. Online learning is also almost guaranteed to exacerbate existing racial and income inequalities in education.“Covid isn’t going away anytime soon, and keeping kids out of schools for a year and a half or two years is going to have significant consequences to their cognitive development and to their social emotional development, really across the entire spectrum,” said Dimitri Christakis, a pediatrician and professor of medicine at the University of Washington who co-authored the NAS’ recommendations on school reopenings. “We declared the pork supply to be a national priority. I’m much more worried about the brain supply than I am about the pork supply.”But some of the plans to start in-person learning have come under intense scrutiny, with policymakers echoing concerns about the detrimental effects of online learning while seemingly ignoring concerns from teachers and parents about the spread of the virus.In Florida, which saw huge surges in July, state leadership has tied reopening for in-person classes with school funding, threatening to refuse state aid if a school sticks to virtual learning.The state prohibits teachers from striking, so the Florida Education Association, the state’s largest teachers’ union, filed a lawsuit against the state for forcing schools to open despite concern from medical experts and teachers about the preparedness of schools to reopen and community transmissions in the state.Rick Colgan, a freshman social studies teacher in Orlando, Florida, said on Wednesday that his school’s administration offered little reassurance of what going back to school would look like on Friday. They gave him the classroom he would be teaching in and a roster of students. Masks will be mandatory, but the school, which has about 2,000 students, could not guarantee that social distancing will be possible. Students were able to opt into virtual learning, but Colgan said he was unsure of how he would be teaching both his virtual and in-person students.“I’m extremely nervous, there’s a knot in my stomach. I haven’t been sleeping well,” Colgan said of the stress of going back to school. “The teachers that I talk to, it’s the same thing.”Farther north, New York City’s plan to reopen the largest school district in the US has caused a weeks-long debate between city leaders, teachers and parents.Bill de Blasio, the mayor, has stuck with a plan to reopen schools with a hybrid model – something that has been scrutinized by epidemiologists. Students will go to school in small groups for two days a week and stay home for three. While parents have the option to opt their kids in for online-only, schools cannot opt out of the hybrid plan.Jessamyn Lee, a mother of two based in Brooklyn, said that there has been scaffolding around her childrens’ school for over a year because the school needed brick repointing that has yet to happen. “Parents see this stuff and say, the city hasn’t taken care of our school buildings so far.”Liat Olenick, an elementary school science teacher based in Brooklyn, said teachers are also frustrated that the city has not sought the input of the plan’s most important stakeholders, only surveying teachers once to see what type of school schedule they would want to follow.“It has just put all the people who actually spend everyday in school in the position of having to push and advocate really hard just to ask basic questions. It’s been a really flawed process,” Olenick said.The New York City teachers union has threatened to strike if schools reopen in-person before it is safe, creating a checklist of what PPE, ventilation and other safety protocols schools need to have in order to reopen. De Blasio has floated the possibility of schools reopening on 10 September, but an official first day has yet to be announced."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f19f220aac0403457b5d981ea7ea4a0e276b0ea/0_399_5990_3595/master/5990.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=eb02598a02825953130d1cdc35ed7cd3","title":"londoners claim toxic air from gasworks damaging their health","story":"Southall residents link redeveloped site to poor health, but developer says it complies with regulationsResidents in Southall are calling on the government to urgently investigate the health impact of the redevelopment of an old gasworks in light of research suggesting the mainly south Asian community is highly susceptible to air pollution.For a year the  has followed the Clean Air for Southall and Hayes (Cash) campaign as they demanded answers from Ealing council, statutory bodies and scientists as to whether a “petrol-like” odour which they say emanated from the site is causing symptoms such as breathing problems, nausea and mental confusion – and serious diseases. They want to know what will be done to eliminate future risks over the 25-year regeneration project.“There has been no proper investigation into how this contaminated site is affecting our health,” said Angela Fonso, of Cash, which wants the government to initiate a detailed study on the impact of the site in the context of the local population, one of the most deprived in London. “I don’t believe this environmental injustice would happen in a more affluent white area.”It is thought that living in areas with toxic air is one of the reasons people from ethnic minorities have suffered a disproportionate number of deaths from Covid-19.A Public Health England (PHE) spokesperson said: “The local authority is responsible for the health of its local population and any public health studies or analyses are for the local authority and its public health team to either carry out or commission.”The site of the former gasworks and chemicals factory has been dogged by controversy since Boris Johnson used mayoral powers in 2010 to overrule Ealing council’s decision against development. Since work began in 2016 to clean the 88-acre site of hydrocarbons including benzene, naphthalene and cyanide, dozens of residents in local streets have complained that a petrol-like smell from the site has been making them sick.Berkeley cleaned – or remediated – the soil on the site of contaminants in an open-air “soil hospital”. It was decided cleaning the soil was safer than transporting contaminated material along residential streets.In July 2018 the Environment Agency (EA) was called in and ordered the Berkeley Group to take steps to mitigate the odour, which the developer complied with.Campaigners claim the problems have persisted and last year crowdfunded for consultation to pursue legal action against the developer. The Berkeley Group has said “any legal action, if and when it materialises, will be vigorously opposed”.“No one wants to take responsibility for us and we’re paying the price with our lives. We’ve been knocking on the doors of the council, PHE, EA and politicians for years,” claimed Joginder Singh Bhangu, a campaigner. “Our community has fallen through the cracks.”Because of its scale, the gasworks redevelopment has multiple regulators: it is up to the EA to regulate the soil and advise Ealing on management of land affected by contamination Ealing has responsibility for investigating complaints of statutory nuisance and PHE are supposed to protect the health of the public. “Covid is showing that health is not just about numbers but about people,” said Araceli Camargo, co-founder of Centric Lab, whose report argues that the health risks of the site can’t be determined by the regulatory limits. The specific challenges to the health of people in Southall, such as overcrowding, stress and poverty, should have been evaluated before introducing a major new source of air pollution, she said.On Beaconsfield Road, a long artery from the junction near the station along the site boundary to a primary school, Bhangu regularly checks on the health of neighbours. Many gardens adjoin the site, where almost 4,000 homes will be built. “Of course we are more worried about coronavirus here, with all the chemicals,” he said. has interviewed dozens of residents of Beaconsfield Road and nearby streets to ask about their health since 2016. Of 48 who returned questionnaires to the , all said they had suffered breathing problems, and 42 said symptoms had led them to the GP. Other symptoms reported included eye problems, headaches, mental confusion and nausea. Arevik and Ashok Martirosyan invited the  to see an oxygen chamber they had rented for their seven-year-old daughter after she began having fainting fits. Around the same time both parents said they had experienced vomiting attacks, and suggested the symptoms were linked to “this very bad smell from the site”.That data – the only available – was provided by consultants for Berkeley, but residents believe Ealing should have conducted its own for comparison. The lack of any legal requirement for the council to do so, or for any of the regulators to act after PHE findings about chemical levels in March 2019, raises questions about the accountability to residents next to one of the UK’s biggest brownfield sites.Last March PHE found that levels of naphthalene, a possible carcinogen, needed to be “reduced urgently” to protect residents’ long-term health. PHE told the  to “get in touch with Ealing council to find out what actions have been taken as a result of the findings in the public health risk assessment”. Ealing council leader Julian Bell told residents in a virtual meeting on 16 July 2020 that chemical levels have been dropping since the soil hospital was dismantled last April.Dr Onkar Sahota, a London assembly member and GP, said that – as the planning authority with the duty of care to residents – Ealing must establish its own independent monitoring of the site for the next phase of development. “The cost of the independent monitoring consultants should be borne by the developer. Representatives of Cash should be on the appointment panel in equal number to those from Ealing council for appointing the new independent consultants to monitor for air quality, carcinogenic and noxious pollutants in the atmosphere,” said Sahota, who said work should stop while the health impact is investigated.Ealing council said it was “determining the criteria for establishing an independent air quality monitoring network around the development”.In any case, the data PHE looked at does not exclude risks to health. Air quality expert Prof Roy Harrison from the University of Birmingham told the : “The VOCs here are much higher than you would expect to see in normal streets,” adding that there would be little dilution of air pollution from the site at homes on the boundary and that naphthalene is “efficient” at getting indoors.Data he saw “well exceeded” PHE’s own guidelines for naphthalene, he said. “In one report, consultants had performed a calculation to estimate the likely annual average concentrations of pollutants, including naphthalene. This gave an annual mean in excess of the WHO recommendation of 10 micrograms per cubic metre. Notably, in a recent report, PHE recommended a lower guideline of 3 micrograms per cubic metre.”Prof Alan Boobis, a toxicologist from Imperial College, said many chemicals, including naphthalene, could explain residents’ symptoms, and stressed the mental toll of worrying about the air they breathe. “Once people are aware that chemical levels are excessive and associated with harm, they react badly to this toxicity and the behavioural response is real,” he suggested, likening this to post-traumatic stress disorder.Residents are now bracing for the next phase of the Southall Waterside development, when National Grid will remediate soil around the blue gas-holder that once signalled the way for planes arriving at Heathrow. It said it had taken “significant control measures” after seeing residents’ video testimonials about the impact of the site.Fonso said: “We want work to cease at Southall Waterside for mitigation measures to be improved during any remediation and for Berkeley to follow the lead of National Grid, which is erecting enclosures, air-filtering systems and removing contaminated soil from the site to protect residents from harmful odours, vapours and dust.”Berkeley did not comment on any plans for further remediation, saying: “This is a highly regulated activity and all work has been closely monitored and approved by the authorities, including the London Borough of Ealing and Environment Agency.”Residents worried about the planned Berkeley St William gasworks developments in East London, and in Brighton, have contacted the Southall campaign for advice.Bhangu, stopping to talk to an elderly neighbour on Beaconsfield Road, said: “What would I say to the other communities where there will be a gasworks redevelopment? Get ready for the nightmare.”Prof Kevin Fenton, London regional director for PHE, said: “The Southall Waterside air quality data provided to PHE has been compared to a variety of available health-based air quality guidelines … for the detected chemicals. The results from our assessments show that there is unlikely to be a risk to the long-term health of the nearby population from chemicals detected.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/333dda8b8a6d61b5578043a3c223a43786f08a42/1081_0_2859_1716/master/2859.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2dbafcaf746c40bae5a8091673ac3f6","title":"away review silent surreal and entrancing animation","story":"This silent adventure film about a man who parachutes out of a plane and lands on an island is both wondrous and weird – see it before TenetIf you have ever sat through the end credits of a mainstream cartoon feature, whether it’s because your kid kicked their shoes under the row in front or because you’re a trade-magazine critic measuring the running time to the minute, you’ll know that there are normally hundreds of people who work on these productions. Animating lends itself to finely isible units of labour, even as it becomes ever more reliant on computers. But technology now also makes it possible for one extremely determined Latvian film-maker to make something wondrous and original in a home studio. It took Gints Zilbalodis some three-and-a-half years to make this crisp, entrancing 75-minute animated feature about a young man who falls out of a plane with a parachute and lands on an island inhabited by friendly birds, turtles and cats – but also a giant shadow monster whose touch instantly kills all life. Luckily, the nameless hero finds a motorcycle and takes off on a journey across the oddly volcanic landscape, (Lanzarote was one visual touchstone), managing to always stay mere metres ahead of the monster.Not a word is spoken throughout, which harkens back to an older era of cinematic storytelling. At the same time, the extreme frame-to-frame fluidity of the computer-assisted animation style, composed entirely of fields of subtly modulated colour, no outlines and minimal modelling, looks completely 21st century. The story is fairytale simple and quite strange, and it’s no surprise to hear that Zilbalodis made it up as he went along. Only towards the end did he realise he was making an allegory about his struggle to complete the film itself. He even wrote the synth-generated music heard here, nothing fancy or complicated with its repetitious chords and phrases, but still oddly potent, recalling the work of the modern minimalists (Philip Glass, Max Richter, Jóhann Jóhannsson and so on) that were his inspirations.

His latest movie is about a student, played by Jessie Buckley, who for six weeks has been dating a dullish man called Jake (Jesse Plemons) for reasons that that she can’t put her finger on. She is now going to meet his parents, an important next step that she has sleepwalked into, like everything else in their relationship.It means a long, uncomfortable, cold drive out to these old folks’ creepy farm in the countryside – just at the moment when she realises that she maybe wants to end things with Jake, which gives her an anti-epiphany about her life and his. (“I’ve never mentioned Jake to my parents and I guess I never will,” she murmurs silently.)She has a clear, dispassionate glimpse of someone whose existence she really isn’t committed to and also of their supposed future lives together: a pointless, arbitrary entanglement, like all coupledom. A warning and despairing voice whispers in her head that all this is pointless but also breaking up could be pointless, too. Should she be ending things in a more radical way? Soon she is to be vouchsafed a haunting vision of the things that are important to poor, boring Jake – his mum and dad (wonderfully played by Toni Collette and David Thewlis), a local ice-cream store and his high school, whose sad old janitor (Guy Boyd) haunts this movie’s dreams.I’m Thinking of Ending Things is adapted by Kaufman from the novel by Canadian author Iain Reid and it’s really scary in a way that conventional scary movies really aren’t scary: insidiously disquieting and yet also somehow poignant and sad, a secondary mood that finally, inexplicably emerges from an unending rhapsody of directionless weirdness. Who is this woman? Who is Jake? Who is the janitor? It’s an arresting drama, although I was sorry that straight-up comedy (which Kaufman can really do) played little part.This film happens to be coming out right on top of Kaufman’s other new work – an epically bizarre autofictional novel called Antkind – and there are points in common, namely, Kaufman’s extraordinary, compulsive way of creating an alternative world of loneliness and sadness, accumulating tension and anxiety and suppressed panic minute by minute. You can spend up to an hour wondering uneasily when this film is going to start, while also realising that you have been on the edge of your seat.As ever, Kaufman shores up his world with pop-culture fragments. Real people get roped in. He has a digression-daydream featuring a made-up romcom directed by Robert Zemeckis. Are we supposed to look down on Zemeckis, therefore? Not necessarily. The couple’s road trip also features a long and rather bad-tempered discussion of the film A Woman Under the Influence by John Cassavetes, although the directors that have surely influenced I’m Thinking of Ending Things, such as Buñuel and Lynch, go unmentioned.The centre of the horror is that farm, stark and cold, where Colette and Thewlis’s strange pair host a decidedly unrelaxed supper party for the unhappy couple. As their appearance starts changing, with the furnishings and photos changing, too, Buckley starts politely asking Jake if they can go home now, and Kaufman demonstrates his unearthly skill in creating scenarios like lucid dreams. Molly Hughes’s production design and Łukasz Żal’s cinematography are also vital in fabricating this world.And what does it all mean? Kaufman is content to swirl away from actual revelations, but his evocation of high-school life occupies the position where in any other kind of fiction an explanation might go. It is a place where Jake seems to have picked up an uncool fondness for musicals and Broadway show tunes, and Kaufman imagines a kind of fantasy dance sequence for Jake and his new girlfriend in the corridors of the school. But perhaps it is more that for many (or maybe even everyone) high school felt shatteringly real in a way that nothing else would, and success there really does feel as good as winning the Nobel prize. Not that Jake has ever achieved anything of the sort, then or now.Plemons stolidly occupies the role of Jake – it is the kind of role that the late Philip Seymour Hoffman (star of Kaufman’s masterpiece, Synecdoche, New York) might also have played. And Buckley is impeccably cast as the young woman adrift in a bad dream someone else is having.• I’m Thinking of Ending Things is on Netflix from 4 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0c38b5987a18c483b52288c3f3ea3f2ff3b78fd/0_74_3003_1802/master/3003.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cda4d5395d544392d03fb32e34d26aef","title":"no aspect of writing makes you rich why do authors get a pittance for film rights","story":"Joanne Harris has revealed that she was paid only £5,000 for the film rights to Chocolat. So why do some authors get the big bucks and some have to settle for the crumbs?When Charles Webb, who died earlier this year, sold the movie rights to his 1963 novel The Graduate for $20,000, it earned him a place in one newspaper’s list of “the world’s biggest mugs”. (Mike Nichols’ 1967 film version grossed more than $100m.) Where does that leave Joanne Harris, who admitted this week that she let Chocolat go for £5,000? Presumably, she would be excused “mug” status by virtue of having also negotiated a £100,000 cut of the film’s box office. Even so, flogging Chocolat so cheaply surely qualifies it as the Milk Tray, rather than the Amedei Porcelana, of movie-rights deals.The promise of wealth from film and television is the pot of gold at the end of the publishing rainbow. There is the $5m that EL James pocketed for selling the screen rights to the Fifty Shades trilogy and the $1.3m that JK Rowling got for the first four Harry Potter books alone. Dan Brown received $6m for allowing The Da Vinci Code to be adapted, while John Grisham landed a $3.75m Hollywood deal in 1993 for The Chamber when it was still at outline stage – the most ever paid at that time for anything scribbled on the back of an envelope.More common are those tales of writers whose work takes an interminable time to reach the screen – Caren Lissner, for instance, whose book Carrie Pilby was optioned on several occasions between publication in 2003 and the film’s production in 2016 – or those that never get greenlit at all.How realistic is it for writers to get rich from selling adaptation rights? “It’s just not,” says Joanna Nadin, whose YA novel Joe All Alone was adapted into a Bafta-winning 2018 television series. “It’s unrealistic to think any aspect of writing can make you rich.” Nadin confesses that she gets dollar signs in her eyes when she learns that a book of hers has been optioned. “For about 10 minutes, I revamp my Oscar acceptance speech, choose my mansion and dine out on imaginary caviar. Then I try not to think about it, knowing that, if anything happens, it won’t be for many years.”Joe All Alone was optioned in 2013, before publication. “It wasn’t big money,” she says. “Less than £5,000. Even though it won a Bafta and got nominated for an Emmy, there was still no life-changing moment. I got some extra payments for each episode so my mortgage was covered for a few months. And I did buy a new dress for the Baftas, then promptly fell over and couldn’t walk, and so missed the whole thing.”Another novelist, CJ Skuse, is about to have her thriller Sweetpea, which she describes as “Bridget Jones meets Dexter”, adapted by Kirstie Swain (who wrote the mental health comedy Pure) as a series for Sky Atlantic. “I thought my first book would get sold to film or TV,” says Skuse, who also works as a lecturer. “But it was my sixth that did the trick. The option on Sweetpea has been renewed a couple of times, which has allowed me to get a loan on a new house – I couldn’t have done that without it and wouldn’t have risked it had the TV option not been in place.”She says that money played no part in the elation she felt once she realised Sweetpea would be made. “It was the recognition I fell in love with. Someone had finally said to me the words I’d wanted to hear for a really long time: ‘You’ve written something incredible, and we want to make your dream come true and put it on TV.’” Not that the cash isn’t welcome. “I am treating myself to a bit of garden design because my back garden makes the Somme look inviting.”Charles Webb would have scoffed. “When you run out of money, it’s a purifying experience,” said the man who gave away every cent he earned from The Graduate, preferring to live on the breadline. After moving to Brighton and selling the film rights to his 2001 novel New Cardiff (filmed as Hope Springs), he used that £10,000 to establish the Creative Minority award. It was won by the artist Dan Shelton, who spent the prize money on mailing himself to Tate Britain in a box. The cheque, in a very real sense, was in the post."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/793ae8e639a3f365370053f006d7dd4d4a7ad146/0_302_6124_3677/master/6124.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=9d5d08d07e536bfa9701db48dc6f00fa","title":"share your experiences of returning to the office after lockdown coronavirus","story":"Whether you work in the UK or in Europe, we want to hear your views about going back to the workplace and commuting during the coronavirus pandemicWhile many people in countries like France, Germany, Italy and Spain have returned to the office, those in the UK have been slower to return to their desks.According to a survey by AlphaWise, only a third of British office workers have returned compared to almost three-quarters of staff in European countries.If you work in the UK or Europe, we would like to hear from workers about how they feel about going back to offices, and how your workplace has changed as a result of the pandemic.

As we don’t have a car, and public transport was discouraged, we booked a hire car with Sixt, via Rentalcars.When we arrived at the agreed collection point, the Sixt office had closed, with a sign giving the new address on the other side of town. We walked there, and found it was shut, too, and the nearest open branch was Birmingham. There was a phone number, but nobody answered.We walked three miles home in the rain and had to tell my mum we wouldn’t be coming after all.It can’t confirm whether the office will be open by then. Instead, it suggested we phone a couple of days before to check, by which point it will be too late to make alternative arrangements. Even worse, we found they were still taking bookings for the Nottingham branch, knowing it’s closed.I reported an identical issue last year when a customer was told to collect her car from an office that had closed months previously and begged in vain for a refund.In a comment cut-and-pasted from last year’s response, Rentalcars told me that if incorrect or outdated booking information prevents a customer collecting a car, it offers a refund and an apology. No mention of compensation for a wasted journey, scuppered holiday plans, pricier rebooking and consequential losses.That, it said when pressed, “may” be forthcoming when “appropriate”.Last year, Rentalcars blamed the busy “summer season” for its abysmal customer service. This time, it cites “difficulties surrounding the current situation” which meant that a “standard process issue has resulted in a failure for this location to be shown as temporarily closed”.It adds: “In every such instance we would always take responsibility for any inconvenience or failure on our part.”If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.

It’s those outstanding Ives performances from LA’s Walt Disney Hall in February, immaculately recorded, that are brought together in this (so far) download-only release.By “complete” symphonies, Deutsche Grammophon means the four numbered works. The set does not include the New England Holiday Symphony, the collection of four pieces named after US public holidays that Ives admitted had no musical connections between them, and which could be played in concert as separate orchestral works, or the tantalising Universe Symphony, planned in 1915 as a contemplation of the mysteries of creation and to be scored for a huge orchestra, which he left as a pile of sketches.Perhaps Dudamel will eventually record both those works, too, for these performances certainly demonstrate that he is a very fine Ives interpreter, unerringly charting the journey from the almost blameless late Romanticism of the First Symphony to the modernist complexity of the Fourth. It was a smart decision for the LA Philharmonic to include Dvořák alongside the Ives symphonies, for the Czech composer, much more than Brahms, seems to lurk behind Ives’s First, which was composed as his graduation exercise from Yale its second movement even seems to begin with a brief reference to the slow movement of the New World Symphony, though the music’s tendency to modulate at the slightest provocation does hint at the later iconoclastic composer.But if the First Symphony was a farewell to the European tradition (Wagner as well as Dvořák), then the Second is positively overflowing with references to American music, whether hymns, patriotic songs or vaudeville numbers. Dudamel and his orchestra expertly tease out the contrapuntal tangles into which Ives weaves those fragmentary references just as surely as they guide the more explicitly quotation-laden Third, The Camp Meeting, towards its rapturous, almost sacramental conclusion.But in any cycle of these symphonies, it’s the Fourth that presents the greatest performing challenges and the greatest musical rewards. Dudamel’s performance, with Marta Gardolińska as the second conductor and the Los Angeles Master Chorale supplying the off-stage choir, magnificently encapsulates this extraordinary work’s complexity and transcendental ambition, with every detail – blurs of quarter-tones, patchworks of quotes, and moments of jaw-dropping immensity – brought into sharp focus. It’s a glorious achievement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33859ae97071d185544b491e5e189658ab853bb2/0_0_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c21bdfe87a5b632b764c2d3021acf1b7","title":"disclosure energy review","story":"(Island Records)With nightclubs closed during coronavirus, the third album from the British pop-house duo has an unwittingly mournful qualityOccasionally, songs take on qualities that their authors never intended them to have. The passage of time casts different light on them political groups and protest movements co-opt them, lending unanticipated meaning to the words artists unexpectedly die and their final work becomes freighted with poignancy. To a roll-call that includes Martha and the Vandellas’ Dancing in the Street, John Lennon’s (Just Like) Starting Over, Bob Dylan’s Maggie’s Farm and McFadden \u0026amp Whitehead’s Ain’t No Stopping Us Now, we now might add, a little unexpectedly, the third album by Surrey-born pop-house duo Disclosure, which events overtook before it was even released.There may have been less opportune moments in history to put out an album filled with songs hymning the pleasures of clubs, of dancing en masse and of fleeting eyes-meeting-across-the-dancefloor romance, but you struggle to think of one. Energy arrives in a world where most venues are shuttered and festivals cancelled, where dancing with others carries with it the potential of contracting a fatal illness, where illegal raves have become a bigger public bugbear than in the Criminal Justice Act-provoking wake of Castlemorton, and where the dance scene has recently been convulsed by an argument about whether DJs should DJ at all. Online footage of big name DJs playing in continental Europe this month was greeted with general horror, the legal but maskless, non-socially-distanced “plague raves” they were performing at held by some to have contributed to a rise in Covid-19 infections.The circumstances mean the songs on Energy take on a slightly peculiar tone. There’s something inadvertently desperate about My High’s refrain of “please don’t fuck up my high” and something inadvertently mournful about the title track’s repurposing of a motivational speaker, ostensibly intended to chivvy the dancefloor along into delirium. “Right now,” he bellows, over an impressively relentless samba house-inspired backing, “you should feel invincible, powerful, strong” – under the circumstances, the emphasis seems to land on the word “should”, rather than the adjectives. You listen to Kelis singing “I like to dance like I’m alone in the room” on opener Watch Your Step and think: you must have been having the time of your life since March, then.It’s a talent that’s still in evidence on Energy, albeit flickering a little more intermittently. My High pivots, thrillingly, on the difference between rappers Aminé and Slowthai. The former opts for relatively laconic in-the-club boasting, the latter sounds like he’s rapping while being manhandled out of the venue by bouncers, bug-eyed, and the sudden increase in tension and drama is authentically gripping. Fatoumata Diawara’s appearance on Douha (Mali Mali) is the album’s highlight, a sparkling, effortlessly euphoric take on 90s filter-heavy French house. Kelis’s insouciant, tough turn on Watch Your Step, a strong syndrum-assisted bit of disco house, is coated in a thin layer of crispy distortion.But the album is bullishly short – 40 minutes – which makes its longueurs more obvious. The UK garage-indebted Who Knew? smears Mick Jenkins’ vocal with effects that sound less like Auto-Tune than an old-fashioned vocoder: floating something ethereal over the urgent beat and retorts of noisy electronics is a nice idea, but the song itself doesn’t go anywhere. Lavender and Ce N’est Pas – a collaboration with Cameroonian vocalist Blick Bassy – are similarly underwhelming: nice enough, but nothing to set your pulse racing, they make you wish that Disclosure would throw caution to the wind, scuff their sound up more, occasionally chuck the listener a curveball. The closest Energy comes to that is on the brief Thinking ’Bout You, which takes a razor to an obscure piece of early 70s Canadian blue-eyed soul, and the dreamy R\u0026ampB slow jam Birthday, complete with heavy-lidded vocals by Kehlani and the Internet’s Syd, both of which hint tantalisingly at a creative expansiveness.For now, however, Disclosure seem largely content to stick to their lane. It should keep their career ticking over commercially until normal clubland service is resumed, and their lyrics seem less wistful.Old-fashioned gospel soul repurposed for the BLM era: plaintive, stirring, funky and fantastic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daaa58938a41df14c6d39877f250ff7128775369/132_0_4585_2752/master/4585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be0ba6281d41cb43cdfef6344a610098","title":"the greatest hardcore rave tracks ranked","story":"With illegal parties cropping up across the UK while clubs are closed, we pick out the best of early 90s breakbeat hardcoreIf hardcore rave was rooted in house and techno, the prosaically titled Made in Two Minutes makes explicit another major influence, hip-hop. This is a largely forgotten strain of British rap inspired by the sound of Public Enemy’s producers the Bomb Squad, with the tempo pushed up and one eye fixed firmly on the post-acid-house dancefloor.Pirate radio classics Spliffhead and Wipe the Needle are better known, but Mixed Truth is the Ragga Twins’ greatest moment, a particularly crazed example of the London duo Shut Up and Dance’s confrontational approach to production: potent, noisy electronics and immediately recognisable, obviously uncleared samples (in this case, from 808 State’s Pacific State).Hardcore’s goofy sense of humour attracted opprobrium, but no artist grasped that particular nettle like Altern-8. Detroit techno heads who became what Simon Reynolds called “the Slade of rave”, they dealt in pranks, blatant drug references and five-year-old MCs. It palled quickly, but E-Vapour-8’s Strings of Life sample and PP Arnold vocal overrides the jokey title.Another example of how Bomb Squad-inspired UK rap fed into rave, Total Confusion was the work of a trio including the late Casper Pound, who went on to found the celebrated techno label Rising High. On one level, it is very of its time on another, its sheer exuberance still cuts through.The work of trumpet-playing producer Gordon Matthewman, Compnded stole its riff from M1’s US house track Feel the Drums, pitching it up and placing it between bursts of fizzing electronics and tiny slivers of vocal. It’s a track that is constantly moving and shifting: the sound of 4am rave delirium.Dozens of hardcore producers fell foul of their cavalier attitude to sampling. Blame’s debut single is a case in point: you want the original version with the snatch of The Beginning by Seal – who apparently offered to re-sing it, before his label vetoed the idea – weaving through the dramatic synth stabs and warped vocal samples.In truth, any track from Foul Play’s first two EPs could have made this list – so could 1993’s more jungle-facing Finest Illusion – but personal preference, and an abiding love for the delirium-inducing moment at 2min 41sec where a sample from Xena’s electro classic On the Upside suddenly appears, means Ricochet clinches it.A pivotal track in the shift from techno to hardcore, Aftermath sounded noticeably different to the other big “Yorkshire bleep” singles released by Warp in the early 90s. The beat clattered away from a straightforward techno pulse, bass was even more overwhelming than that on LFO’s incredible LFO, the mood was weirder: simultaneously celebratory and unsettling.Lock Up ended up sampled on Dr Spin’s appalling 1992 novelty hit Tetris, a grim fate for such a great track. Only included on Zero B’s debut EP because he left the DAT of the intended track at home, it’s a perfect confection of funk guitar, Sheffield techno-inspired bleeps and exultant, hands-in-the-air breakdown.Charly inadvertently spawned a wave of rotten kiddie-rave novelty hits, but the original is fantastic: tense and atmospheric, its sample wasn’t a kids TV theme but a cartoon public information film warning about paedophiles. It’s closer in spirit to Bam Bam’s terrifying acid house classic Where’s Your Child? than the tracks it inspired.Shut Up and Dance were a law unto themselves: anti-drugs, even anti-rave – their biggest hit, the infamous Raving I’m Raving, was a sly dig at ecstasy users – their music never quite like anyone else’s. Named after a Hackney pub notorious for crack dealing, The Green Man was a gripping, disorienting swirl of orchestral samples.Goldie’s early releases exist in a liminal space where “dark” hardcore begins mutating into drum’n’bass. At the time, Terminator’s groundbreaking explosion of beats subjected to time-stretching – a key sound in the drum’n’bass arsenal – sounded utterly extraordinary, as if the world had suddenly spun off its axis.With the title of its mix referencing the Liverpool club Quadrant Park, Bizarre Inc’s Playing With Knives was a distinctly north-west twist on hardcore, brazenly stirring the area’s penchant for Italian house – replete with piano and screaming a vocals – into the mix. A perfect confection of commerciality and punch, it made the Top 5.Inescapable in 1991, Dominator offered the sound of the Mentasm “hoover” (see No 3) gone feral, relentlessly surging and ing behind a couple of snappy hip-hop samples. Joey Beltram’s breakbeat-laden remix is the killer all-out-assault, although the moment when the original version deploys an old-fashioned burglar alarm on top of everything else is pretty bracing.Rave producers often seemed to gleefully ransack the past, ripping out samples they then warped and twisted to their own chaotic ends. DJs Take Control is still exciting, but more reverential in its approach: its repurposing of the Nightwriters’ Chicago house anthem Let The Music Use You is a respectful tip of the hat to hardcore’s roots.A London collective beloved of the Prodigy’s Liam Howlett, blessed with some extraordinary pseudonyms – take a bow Fragile Scotty and James Da Shit – Genaside II’s masterpiece leavened its claustrophobic atmosphere and raw dancehall MCing with a sweet female street soul vocal. The awesome Narra Mine may be hardcore’s answer to Massive Attack’s Unfinished Sympathy.Ce Ce Roger’s early house anthem Someday spawned two rave anthems. Liquid’s Sweet Harmony warped the track’s piano riff and a snatch of vocal into a Top 20 hit Some Justice turned its intro into one of hardcore’s most glorious hands-in-the-air breakdowns, surrounded by explosive breakbeats and weirdly ominous synth stabs.Rightly credited with dragging rave into weirder, darker territory, 4 Hero’s hardcore tracks weren’t always straightforwardly nightmarish. The fantastic Burning flips between blissful female vocals and Loleatta Holloway samples and brain-scrambling chaos, capturing the moment when hedonism turns queasy and out-of-control.At the time, tracks like the Doc Scott-produced Here Come the Drumz seemed to ide the rave scene: some people embraced them, others didn’t want their high spoiled by something so intense and wilfully un-euphoric. Thirty years later, it just sounds awesome, a brutal wall of rhythm, car-alarm synths and Public Enemy samples.Outlander was Marcos Salon, who began his career as a producer on Belgium’s New Beat scene. His biggest track, Vamp, was both hugely influential and, with its roots in Detroit techno still audible, relatively restrained by Belgian hardcore standards. The exhilarating but off-kilter lurch of its main riff is a simulacrum of the ecstasy user’s unsteady ascent.This year, XL Recordings’ Richard Russell said he knew from the start that the Prodigy would be the rave scene’s biggest stars. Certainly, Your Love is a superb and remarkably assured debut single: a collage of uplifting house piano, soul samples and electronic noise, commercial without a hint of cheese.Financed by 80s soul star Phil Fearon and best known for Baby D’s No 1 Let Me Be Your Fantasy, the Production House label released a string of underground classics, but this mix of Euphoria – an overload of samples and blissful electronics over a rhythm on the cusp of hardcore’s transformation into jungle – is the best, a pure, shiver-inducing delight.Possibly the most influential dance track of its era, Mentasm stood out for its “hoover” noise. It was a product of the producer Joey Beltram’slove of heavy metal he tried to recreate its mood using a Juno synth. The sound – thrilling or terrifying, according to your mood – went on to consume hardcore itself: umpteen tracks used it in Mentasm’s wake.In snootier quarters, hardcore was viewed as house music’s gurning idiot younger brother: unsophisticated, predicated on novelty. Acen’s Trip to the Moon series gave the lie to that idea: his productions were complex, stitching samples from Rakim, John Barry, the Doors and forgotten UK soul band Tongue ’N’ Cheek into an utterly thrilling rush of sound.Three decades on, and with a clearer head, you can see why rave or hardcore was so reviled at the time by critics and house and techno connoisseurs. Populist rather than elitist, it was seldom subtle: the sped-up helium vocals, the blatant drug references, the jokes. Equally, who could dismiss a genre that birthed a track as flat-out great as Bombscare? It’s a masterpiece of minimalism – there’s nothing to it beyond a breakbeat, a nagging riff and sub-bass – but it works, effortlessly, perfectly. YouTube comments under hardcore tracks tend to defiant reminiscences of the “if you were there, you know” variety, which is true, but Bombscare doesn’t require a nostalgic glow to appreciate. And the flipside, Hold It Down, is amazing, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dca007efb59c2a9286902e781ad1b74e9355c50/11_907_7658_4597/master/7658.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=ac7d5196386f3af496ce8f08fe15c03f","title":"germany scraps plans for brexit talks at eu ambassadors summit","story":"Exclusive: Brussels laments ‘completely wasted’ summer as Berlin takes Brexit off agenda due to lack of ‘tangible progress’Germany has scrapped plans to discuss Brexit at a high-level diplomatic meeting next week because there has not been “any tangible progress” in talks, the  has learned, as Brussels laments a “completely wasted” summer.EU officials now believe the UK government is prepared to risk a no-deal exit when the transition period comes to an end on 31 December, and will try to pin the blame on Brussels if talks fail.The German government, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU council, had intended to discuss Brexit during a meeting of EU ambassadors on 2 September but has now dropped the issue. “Since there hasn’t been any tangible progress in EU-UK negotiations, the Brexit item was taken off the agenda,” an EU diplomat said.The decision matters because Angela Merkel was billed as a potential dealmaker when talks on the UK-EU future relationship reach a crucial stage this autumn.The German chancellor last week met Emmanuel Macron at the French president’s official residence on the French Riviera, where they discussed the EU’s post-Brexit future. Following last week’s inconclusive round of negotiations, both governments issued near-identical statements calling for “concrete answers” from the British government.“Over the recent months Franco-German cooperation has gained new traction,” said the EU diplomat, with the two countries having “realigned” on issues including Brexit. “Given this new reality it would be futile to wait for a white knight from Paris or Berlin to come to the rescue.”Sandro Gozi, an Italian MEP who sits in Macron’s party in the European parliament and was Italy’s Europe minister during the early phase of Brexit talks, said: “I doubt even Merkel or Macron would be able to transform a stalemate into a positive outcome.“I have always thought – that is my personal position – that no-deal was a real option especially on London’s side … Every day that passes without concrete progress is a day closer to no-deal Brexit.”Dropping Brexit from next week’s diplomatic agenda is a sign of deepening pessimism in Brussels. “People underestimate how bleak the mood is in the EU negotiation team,” said an EU official who added that time was running out to negotiate a complex legal treaty expected to exceed 400 pages.“We have had the whole summer completely wasted, a cabinet that doesn’t understand how the negotiations work, a prime minister who, I think, doesn’t understand how the negotiations work – because he is under the wrong impression that he can pull off negotiating at the 11th hour.”The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, last week declared he was surprised by the UK “wasting valuable time” as Boris Johnson had told EU leaders in June that he wanted an outline deal by July.The EU official said: “If they (the UK government) see it’s not going to work out they are just going to try and make it really acrimonious.”A UK document leaked to the Sun on Sunday, warning of public disorder, shortages and price hikes in the event of a no-deal Brexit, was perceived in Brussels as a sign of the government’s seriousness about leaving the EU single market and customs union with no agreement.“More and more people have come to the conclusion that Brexit ideology trumps Brexit pragmatism in the UK government,” the diplomat said. “If the UK really wanted to jump off the Brexit cliff for ideological reasons, there would be no way for the EU to stop this.” If the UK’s negotiating stance became “more pragmatic and realistic”, there was still a chance to save the talks, they added.For the EU, “pragmatism” means accepting that tariff-free access to the single market necessitates common standards on environment, state aid, worker and consumer protection – a position rejected by the UK.With talks set to resume on 7 September, EU sources are increasingly frustrated with the UK chief negotiator, David Frost. “The feeling is that David Frost acts more as a UK messenger then a UK negotiator. If he doesn’t get more negotiating space, talks will remain in dire straits,” said the EU diplomat.British officials hit back, accusing the EU of slowing progress by insisting that all difficult issues had to be resolved in parallel. “The EU’s insistence that nothing can now progress until we have accepted EU positions on fisheries and state aid policy is a recipe for holding up the whole negotiation at a moment when time is short for both sides,” said a UK source close to negotiations.“We are also faced with the EU’s frustrating insistence on parallelism, meaning that they will not progress areas apart from these ‘difficult’ ones until we have moved towards their position on them. That’s a sure way to hold up the negotiations. For our part we are ready to knuckle down and get into the detailed discussions of legal texts which is what is needed now. We hope the EU will do likewise.”Johnson is understood to have full confidence in Frost and the UK negotiating team."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87e0514778945b1a9201e649f0c22e7fa30544c3/0_218_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55ae777e548d71130040f191c0a58cf5","title":"ed davey elected liberal democrat leader","story":"Former coalition minister says his party must start listening as he defeats Layla MoranEd Davey urged the Liberal Democrats to “wake up and smell the coffee”, as he was declared his party’s fourth leader in five years after a string of poor general election performances.Davey, who has been acting leader since last December, was a cabinet minister in the 2010-2015 coalition government.

The pandemic has simply accelerated that transformation, he said ahead of a British Retail Consortium webinar on the impact of Covid-19.Even an industry that has weathered its fair share of storms has never seen an event of this size and significance, and it’s becoming clear that the rules of engagement are changing. As retailers navigate uncharted waters, these are the rules that matter right now:Put safety firstAbove all, responsible businesses have to prioritise safety, both for staff and customers. According to Kyle Monk, head of retail insights and analytics at the British Retail Consortium, retailers are working hard on both implementing safety measures and communicating them clearly. Luckily, technology is on our side when it comes to designing systems that put safety first, but not at the expense of the customer experience. He cites a technology company that has shop assistants available by video screen in-store. The remote shop assistants can engage with you in a similar way in which they would normally.While it may seem at first that the new retail environment will not make the most fun of shopping experiences, with creativity, innovation and by utilising tech, companies can get the balance right.Be collaborative“The scale of the pandemic and the speed with which we’ve had to adopt a new way of living has left many of us feeling uncertain – especially retailers,” says Andrew Lawson, senior vice-president EMEA for Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. The good news, however, is that a sense of optimism is emerging as businesses deal successfully with unstable operating conditions. “We’ve seen incredible stories of resilience coming out of the pandemic, as retailers and their suppliers band together to maintain the flow of goods,” says Lawson.This collaborative spirit will be important for the industry if it is to retain momentum, share best practice and agree about what support may be needed from the government. “It’s kind of unprecedented,” says Monk. “I don’t think, to be honest, any other industry is coordinating in the way that retail is at the moment.”PrioritiseWhile some retailers have launched e-commerce platforms in record time – one European chain that had around 1,000 stores but no e-commerce platform, managed to launch one in 13 weeks – Lawson suggests that incremental digital transformation might be the better way forward. Zendesk is finding that many of its customers are reluctant to invest time and money in total digital transformation when there is still so much uncertainty. “The priority is to identify solutions that can deliver returns on investment quickly,” he says. “For example, by looking at an omnichannel approach, you can bring all the information you have on a customer together in one place. This will provide your marketing and sales teams with invaluable insights.”Support your staffWe may never return to business as usual but, according to Lawson, companies can move forward by supporting and listening to feedback from staff. He also emphasises the connection between a happy and valued workforce, and the ability to be agile, scalable and resilient. “By helping employees adapt to new systems and processes through training and regular communication, and by really listening to feedback, the new styles and systems that we work under really can work for everyone,” he says.Appeal to your fansThere has never been a better time for companies to revisit their core purpose – building a trusted and valued brand. Research from Zendesk shows that customers have been more patient during the pandemic. While the volume of service requests and wait times have gone up, customer satisfaction remains fairly steady, indicating brand loyalty. Customers will support the brands that they want to succeed, says Monk.And Gibb believes successful retailers won’t have customers going forward, they’ll have loyal fans – people who care deeply about what that brand really stands for.

Now everyone faces a new issue: how to return to some semblance of business normality.“The world of work – particularly how we think about work and how we think about where we work, has fundamentally shifted,” says coach and productivity expert Karen Eyre-White. “A lot of businesses have been in crisis mode. What we’re seeing now is them having to get back to a new normal with strategy, boundaries and structure in place.”Some things haven’t changed. As before, high productivity will be a priority – particularly given the gloomy economic predictions. Achieving it depends on motivation, training and technology, time management and support from others. But how can businesses make sure they have these essentials in place as we move out of lockdown and get back to work?Have clarity of purposeWith so much uncertainty around, business leaders need to reassure staff by projecting confidence and clarity wherever possible. “Try to be certain about as much as you can,” says Eyre-White, whether that involves scheduling regular catch-up meetings, or deciding the office won’t reopen until next year. Managers can boost their own productivity and that of their team by being clear about their priorities for any given day or week, and encouraging others to do the same.Aligning those priorities with the company’s objectives will keep even a remote team moving in the right direction, says Chris Bailey, author of Hyperfocus: How to Work Less to Achieve More. “The greatest challenge that businesses face in normal times is orienting what everybody’s working on toward what the purpose of the business is … and that’s still the case,” he says. “The more intentional we are about how we work and what we work on, the more productive we become.”Where priorities have changed, it’s important to communicate that effectively to staff, says Sarah Manning, senior HR director at Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. “I can’t imagine many organisations didn’t have to pivot in some way in lockdown. Leaders need to be really clear now about what the expectation of their teams are going to be and put in measures to help people adapt.”Empower staff to find their way of workingProductivity can be difficult to measure, but focusing on the tasks achieved rather than the hours someone is at their desk can boost efficiency. Despite reports that lockdown led to an upsurge in demand for workforce surveillance tools, Eyre-White says that such an approach is unlikely to be effective. “Inidually, everyone needs to do different things in order to be productive,” she adds. “I just do not see how a surveillance system is compatible with that.”Instead, businesses should be encouraging staff to find what works for them – some people might be most productive if they go for a walk in the morning, others might take short breaks after 45 minutes of focused work, while some team members might need to work around a young family at home.Projecting empathy for the circumstances many of us find ourselves in is important, says Manning. Particularly at present. “Life is crazy right now. I think employers need to acknowledge that.”Promote good communicationWhen it comes to managing virtual teams, good communication is key to ensuring staff feel supported and informed. “Once a company has made a decision, communicate it clearly,” says Manning. “You need to be careful not to go out with half a message and cause a whole lot of anxiety for people.”Keeping communication channels open can promote a culture of collaboration.Apps such as Zoom, Slack, other digital tools and internal help desks can help ensure “people still feel engaged, connected and therefore invested”, says Manning. Zendesk, for example, has held remote quizzes, yoga classes and Friday night drinks during lockdown. There are other examples of companies holding digital book clubs, remote murder mystery games, and scavenger hunts.“Anything you can do as a manager to foster meaningful connections between employees will go a long way,” Bailey says.It’s OK to have down timeStaff may be working from home, but it’s important not to encourage an “always on” culture that blurs the boundaries between work life and home life, Eyre-White says. “There’s this idea of e-presenteeism and needing to be seen,” she adds. “Staff can’t be seen in the office so they may feel they need to be replying to their emails or messages instantly. And that’s not how you get productive work done. You need time away from those things. Businesses need to be clear that it’s OK.”One way to set the tone is to offer training to managers to help them adapt to working with, and supporting, remote teams. Simple measures can set an example, such as resisting the temptation to email outside work hours, and blocking out time for breaks on a calendar that the team has access to.No one should feel guilty about taking a break from work, says Bailey. “Focusing on things all day long is one of the worst things we can do because our mind just needs a chance to wander. Mind the guilt that you experience around relaxation and know that it’s a phenomenon most of us experience.”Embrace flexibilityAlongside the difficulties of the past few months, for many firms there have also been opportunities for lasting change.“If going remote didn’t kill a business, companies are going to have to decide their answer when employees ask: ‘Can I work from home?’” Manning says. “There are huge benefits from a cost perspective … and I do think companies can potentially attract more candidates and more ersity.”Staying flexible – and that might mean some staff work remotely in the long term – will help foster an inclusive, productive culture that has broader benefits.“This has definitely opened our eyes up to those different possibilities,” Manning adds. “We are going to have a much more flexible approach to where people can work and how they work.”Things are changing fast.

A huge drop in sales during March seemed to sound the death knell for at least some sectors of the industry. Online sales, on the other hand, have rocketed and new approaches are emerging among those retailers that are learning to be agile.“Covid-19 has really accelerated a bunch of inevitables. A lot of things are just happening a lot faster,” says Steve Hewett, global vice president for retail customer experience at the tech and consultancy firm Capgemini.For many companies, online is exploding. “This was already happening,” says Hewett. “But some companies are achieving the sort of online growth in weeks that they expected in three or four years.”This has implications for how companies do business, and it’s likely to be crucial to be able to deliver a hybrid onlineoffline experience to the post-Covid-19 customer. Here are five trends currently reshaping the retail sector:Brands are getting chattierIt seems that customers engaged with brands more during lockdown. “For years, buying something meant going to a physical place, seeing the branding in the store and understanding who that brand is,” says Adrian McDermott, president of products at Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. “We need to establish the digital equivalents of finding, meeting and having those conversations.”Prices could remain “sticky”Rajesh Bhargave, a consumer behaviour expert, suggests that retailers need to be wary of changing their prices – whether up or down. “Consumers tend to remember what they paid previously and would view price increases as unjust in poor economic conditions.”Dropping prices is not always the answer either. Many consumers will have taken a financial hit and their wallets will be closed for concessionary spending. A knee-jerk reaction might be to cut prices to bring back that demand but, says Bhargave, associate professor of marketing at Imperial College Business School in London, this could have negative long-term effects and erode pricing power: “If you’ve been paying £10 for a meal and suddenly that’s £8 you start to wonder about the quality of the meal.”Brands have to add valueInstead of dropping prices, brands are likely to start looking at different ways to add value, says Bhargave. “If people want to dine at restaurants, they might want a more private and safe experience,” he says. “So how can you start offering a different service that charges a higher price and offers better value?”Video calling is another area that business is only starting to explore. “With so much taking place on Zoom, is there a higher-end service you can provide in this area?” Selfridges, for example, is offering online beauty and styling appointments, with products then delivered to customers at home.This is part of a move towards getting more revenue from fewer people, and appointments for in-store shopping also fall into this category. “It’s all part of offering a more customised, high-end experience,” says Bhargave.To bring the joy back into shopping, some stores are putting their energies into their window displays to encourage browsing and others are providing queue entertainment.The need for a new kind of agilityThings may never be the same. “We’ve almost got to hit the reset button,” says Hewett. “People are returning to school and the office and there’s no playbook on what the wants and needs are.” Moreover, whatever they are could change dramatically again. Hewett adds: “There’s an organisational need for agility that wasn’t there before, as brands aren’t able to be as tactical as they would like.”Things are changing fast. But you can be faster.

Despite government support, having to close their doors for months had a crippling effect on many and forced them to take action to keep afloat.For Steve Sanderson, founder of the independent menswear retailer Oi Polloi, lockdown pressed fast forward on an already tough situation for small businesses. The company’s store in Manchester has always been at its heart, but it also has a strong online and social presence. “Bricks and mortar operations are really difficult,” he says. “What’s going on at the moment is sort of a super fast wormhole journey into the future.”Sanderson says that things are going to be particularly tough for fashion stores, with an inevitable drop in footfall, plus the issues of being Covid-19-secure, such as being unable to let customers try on clothes unless the items are quarantined or cleaned afterwards. “If people can’t try things on, why would they come in to a clothes shop?” he asks.There are, though, some rays of hope. “We have a good connection with customers through our bricks and mortar business, and certain people will always like that. But we can’t afford to just be open – we have to find a way of making it work.“We’ll have to adapt and become something else, something people can’t get from anywhere else. I like the idea of click and collect because you can do something quite interesting with that. You could then also narrow down the time the store itself is open.”For Michelle Drew, co-founder of Established 25 Atelier, which sells fashion and home accessories, the coronavirus crisis forced her to reassess her ambitions. Before lockdown, Drew, who started in 2017 making scarves and bags for friends and family, was selling at a quarterly design market in Greenwich and had a monthly stall at Spitalfields market. When Covid-19 brought things grinding to a halt, her first thought was that she needed to get her website up and running, and really engage online. “I didn’t have a choice,” she says.Since then, Drew has joined online workshops and used the time to rethink her plans. “Previously, I thought I’d love to collaborate with other designers and have a premises. I’m now wondering if that’s the way forward, because so much has changed and I’m not sure things will ever be the same.”While Drew plans to return to physical selling at some point, she sees her business relying more on online trading. “It’s still a precarious situation. I definitely will return to the markets because I enjoy the contact, but I’m looking at other ways to move the business forward.”Bigger retailers, too, have faced challenges, for all their greater resources. Some have come through with flying colours, though, particularly if they had the right technology to hand.For Tesco, the coronavirus crisis brought an unprecedented surge in demand, but the company was well placed to react quickly. It already had emergency plans in place thanks to a “doomsday” management exercise four years ago. It had also embraced remote working, and had the technology to handle communication with 460,000 staff, suppliers, people services and security operations. These systems allowed the company to double its capacity for delivery and click and collect in just six weeks. Improvements to the computer algorithms used to drive picking technology – plus the army of pickers hired to cope with the increased demand – mean that whatever the future brings, the chain appears to have the flexibility to deal with it.Similarly, the online flower delivery company Bloom \u0026amp Wild proved its resilience. For its founder Aron Gelbard, protecting jobs by staying open was important, as was providing people with a way of showing they care for the loved ones they couldn’t see in lockdown.With its tailored CRM system, which manages queries from a range of channels, Bloom \u0026amp Wild now employs more than 25 customer service agents who manage between 3,000 and 3,500 inquiries every week – rising dramatically during peak times such as Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day and, undoubtedly, lockdown.The company uses Zendesk to manage its customer relationships, allowing agents to deal with inquiries across Twitter, email, phone, online chat, Facebook Messenger and SMS. Alongside this, analytics help the company forecast customer demand and plan for peaks.As a business that exists purely in the virtual world, it’s an example to retailers everywhere of what can be achieved by clever use of technology.Things are changing fast.

It’s definitely impacting on mental health for so many girls and young women.“It’s just such a shame that girls have to resort to coming off social media, and doing things like trying to change the way they look just to make themselves feel more confident, when in reality most of the things they see aren’t realistic at all.”Eight out of 10 respondents aged 11-21 had considered changing how they looked, with more than half thinking this would improve their confidence or make them feel better about themselves.Three-quarters would like cosmetic procedures, such as lip fillers and Botox, banned for under-18s, while two-thirds would like new legislation preventing them from being exposed to adverts for diets or weight loss.Girlguiding’s chief executive, Angela Salt, said: “Young people are an important part of our recovery, but they are undoubtedly one of society’s hardest hit by the impact of the pandemic.“We are proud to be able to offer girls and young women help and support to navigate these relentless pressures and aim to extend our reach further, so even more can benefit from the support Girlguiding provides.”Girlguiding has submitted evidence to this year’s women and equalities committee inquiry into body image."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce88fa59252d3813211fe8f51d71790aa547616d/0_0_2265_1359/master/2265.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=24bb8bdec02d8b4df535539f1d8fd19f","title":"taught me value slowing down solace of allotments","story":"UK allotment holders took comfort from their plots in the worst days of the pandemic.

This is the story of three days inside the bubble“We’re in the bubble, bro,” Isaac Chamberlain exclaimed as, rather than bumping elbows, he gave me a bear-like hug in a Covid testing room at a Holiday Inn on the outskirts of Redditch, near Birmingham, last Thursday morning. It was easy to understand the 26-year-old boxer’s readiness to demolish social distancing measures because he was just 60 hours away from making his return to the ring. We also knew that, as soon as we had been tested, we would be confined to a strict quarantine. It was one last embrace before another lockdown.The Brixton cruiserweight was desperate to resume his career which had been put on hold the previous 22 months.A chain of small catastrophes – including the jailing of his American promoter, broken promises and the onset of a global pandemic – meant that his past four scheduled fights had been cancelled. But Chamberlain, who is one of boxing’s most intelligent and intriguing fighters, was on the cusp of a comeback in the sport’s first promotion on British terrestrial television since the coronavirus turned the world upside down.I had become friendly with Chamberlain after first interviewing him nine months ago. As an 11-year-old boy he had delivered drugs for gangs in south London but, since boxing helped him escape that brutal landscape, Chamberlain had been determined to one day become a world champion. That might seem a familiar backstory but Chamberlain examines his life and writes about it with an introspection and eloquence that is different to most fighters.His mask was blue, and mine was black, but the crinkly folds around his eyes told me Chamberlain was smiling. A Covid test was one of the final barriers before he could fight again. His new promoter, Mick Hennessy, who helped Carl Froch and Tyson Fury become world champions, waited outside with his son, Michael, another fighter on last Saturday night’s bill.Chamberlain moved to the designated spot, where the nurse waited, and slipped off his mask. He opened his mouth so a swab could be taken. A nasal swab followed and both were sealed in sterilised containers. There was nothing else we could do but wait for the results.The fighters, Hennessey’s promotional team, British boxing board officials and I disappeared to our respective rooms. Meals came and went, delivered to our doors with a quiet knock. I worked, swapped messages with Chamberlain and looked out of the third floor window. The words “NO EXIT” were painted on the road outside. We were going nowhere.At 10pm I heard voices outside. When it was my turn I received cheerful confirmation that I had tested negative for coronavirus. A black bracelet, worn on my wrist, carried the message: Testing Passed. Everyone in our bubble was clear. Saturday night’s promotion, and every fight on the bill, was on.None of us left the hotel for the next 44 hours but, just before lunchtime on Friday, the familiar ritual of the weigh-in unfolded in the same room we had been tested. Paul Booth, the shaven-headed MC, wore a blue suit and a black bow-tie as he called each fighter to the scales.Chamberlain ambled over in white socks and sliders. He wore his mask, tracksuit bottoms and a black T-shirt which said End Racism on the back. The fighter stood barefoot and bare-chested on the scales, wearing his mask, and Booth confirmed he had made the cruiserweight limit. Chamberlain’s squat opponent, Antony Woolery, who had a modest record of two wins and two losses, looked as if he was trying to hide a little paunch as they did the traditional face-off in masks. The difference between their physiques was stark – and it was obvious which of the contrasting pair had been awarded a five-year contract by Hennessy.Boxing is still a psychological ordeal. The night before a fight always drags. Hennessy’s son, Michael, a baby-faced 20-year-old middleweight, broke the unsettling monotony. He and his trainer Junior Saba stepped into the corridor on the third floor where most of us were in our isolated rooms. The whappity-whap thud of gloves smacking into pads echoed outside the elevator as Hennessy Jr and Saba killed time that Friday night.Fight day was another slow trial. But, with a languid Chamberlain setting the mood, the morning was strangely relaxed. I spoke to both Hennessy Sr and Jr as they reflected on their roles as promoter and fighter. “This is the most unusual promotion I’ve ever run, and I’ve been through plenty of strange ones,” Hennessy Sr said wryly. “It’s been difficult because it’s our first bubble, and the first night of boxing on terrestrial television, but everything’s gone well.”The headline bout was a British light-heavyweight title fight between Shakan Pitters and Chad Sugden. The 6ft 6in Pitters, alongside Chamberlain, represents Hennessy’s new wave of fighters. “They’re very charismatic and hugely promising fighters,” Hennessy said of Pitters and Chamberlain. “You just have to spend time with Isaac to know he’s special. He lights up the room. We can get three million tuning into Channel 5 so I’m excited to build Isaac’s name on terrestrial television.”Hennessy had reconciled himself to the fact his son was consumed by boxing. The promoter tried to keep him away from the ring but, finally, when Michael was 11, he allowed his boy to join a gym in Kent. After Michael had won his third amateur bout, Hennessy told his son how proud he was as he tucked him up in bed. “I’d just turned off his light,” Hennessy remembered, “and he said: ‘Hey, Dad? 3 and 0, baby!’”Hennessey sat on his son’s bed and explained the harsh business of boxing. There were two options for Michael. He could keep fighting in his own gym and padding a winning record or he could go on the road and, amid the inevitable dodgy decisions and bruising defeats, he would learn how to fight. “I took the road,” Hennessy Jr told me.Aged 15, Hennessy Jr was so smitten with boxing he asked his dad if they could move to Mexico so he could turn pro. He was in thrall to stories of great Mexican fighters becoming teenage professionals. His dad laughed and told him to keep working hard at school. Michael got five A*s and five As in his GSCEs.Hennessy Jr smiled when I mentioned fight reports which described him as being “angel-faced.” He pointed out his old school preference for great fighters in Sugar Ray Leonard, James Toney, Arturo Gatti and Canelo Alvárez. Chamberlain is also a boxing connoisseur and, that morning, we sat in the deserted lounge and watched videos on his phone of his favourite boxer. Joan Guzman, a former world champion super-bantamweight, was a slick stylist from the Dominican Republic. Guzman carried enough power to earn himself the name of “Little Tyson” in the late 1990s but Chamberlain loved his fluid technique. He also showed me how Guzman used to leave his corner after the first bell and leap and twirl in the air before throwing a punch. “I’m gonna do that tonight,” Chamberlain cackled. “Just watch.”There was less frivolity at 6pm as Chamberlain and I sat on two wooden chairs in a Channel Five studio. A boxing ring was lit up by the surrounding huge screens which all carried the No 5 against a bright red backdrop. It was dark in our corner. Instead of thousands of people drinking and singing Sweet Caroline while the countdown to a night of boxing intensified, the TV studio was hushed and empty. “This is surreal,” Chamberlain said softly. “It’s making me have deep thoughts and powerful emotions. I can’t believe I’m fighting again.”I watched the Covid cleaning team chatting at ringside. Later, I learned that the four temporary cleaners, who sanitised the ring after every fight, were actually doctors. Sultan Hassan, who worked that night as a medic and a cleaner dressed in full PPE straight out of a sci-fi movie, sent me a tweet: “This would be the most qualified cleaning team comprising a consultant plastic surgeon, anaesthetist and two emergencyGP doctors. Well done Mick Hennessy for a well-organised show.” By the time Hennessy Jr stepped into the ring, for the second bout of the night, and the fifth of his career, we had almost forgotten the Covid circumstances. Chamberlain’s voice echoed above the fighters’ gasps and grunts and the disconcerting thud of fists smacking into flesh and bone. Boxing seemed very raw as there was no crowd noise to disguise the sound of hurt.“Good shot, bro,” Chamberlain shouted to Hennessy. “Use your feet. Hunt him down. That’s great … feint to the body. Double jab, right hook, Yeah! Beautiful boxing, bro.”Between rounds, Chamberlain turned to me: “This is nerve-wracking, man!” Even when Hennessy was pressured by his opponent, Tom Brennan, Chamberlain reassured him by shouting: “He’s got nothing, Mike. Use that jab. Start flowing, bro!”Hennessy Jr won the fight on points and, with an hour left until he stepped into the ring, it was time for Chamberlain to retreat to the curtained area. His hands were wrapped in silence while we listened to the punches landing amid shouts from the two corners as the next fight began.In an eerie blue light Chamberlain lay on the floor and began to stretch. It looked as if he was about to begin an elaborate dance routine as he rose to his haunches and extended his legs.Later, he stood patiently while Vaseline was applied to his eyebrows. His gloves were pulled on and then, with 20 minutes left, Chamberlain began to hit the pads held for him by his trainer.The next call came. “Ten minutes to go …” Everything felt very serious. Chamberlain was concentrated and glistening as, with sighs and cries, he crashed punches into the shuddering mitts.“Five minutes, gents,” a Channel Five production man said as sweat flew across the tented room. Chamberlain offered his black glove so we could bump fists. It was a little good luck from me to a fighter who had been through so much.Chamberlain wore a shimmering black singlet and, across the back, those persuasive words were stitched in white: End Racism. I walked behind the fighter as he headed for the ring. There was a long pause when, close to the seats where we had watched Hennessy fight, Chamberlain waited. He watched his opponent enter the ring.Finally, the moment came. The sound of Clearly, a track by A2, an artist from east London, reverberated around the arena. Chamberlain was picked out by the television cameras as he walked across the vacant studio while A2’s desolate words boomed. Without any fans it was like nothing I had seen in boxing. It was a fight for our Covid times.Chamberlain kept his promise and did a leap and twirl in his corner, in honour of Guzman, after the opening bell.The gulf in class was obvious even if it took two rounds for Chamberlain to shake off his ring rust against an aggressive Woolery. After a minute of round three, having repeatedly snapped his beautiful jab into Woolery’s face, Chamberlain opened up. He speared heavy hooks into his rival’s sagging frame. A vicious left hook to the body dropped Woolery. The referee stopped counting at seven. Chamberlain had won on a third-round knockout.His next test will be in the ring a week on Saturday, again on Channel Five and in another bubble – with this fight in an empty television studio in Wakefield.“It felt like a fight,” Chamberlain said in his dressing room. “I was zoned in and didn’t notice anything outside the ring. As soon as he stepped in I hit him with the jab. Boom. I kept thinking: ‘Wait for him to come in and jab.’ I wanted him to throw because I’m very good with aggressive counters. His jab would come and I’d change the angles. I was trying stuff I’d learned these past 22 months. But I hit him and I hurt him. I then went bap, bap, bap to the head, to bring his hands up, and then, boom, back to the body!”After Woolery visited Chamberlain’s dressing room to pay his respects and ask for a photo, it felt calm. This is how boxing, and life, has to be for the foreseeable future. “It’s weird,” Chamberlain said, “but it’s almost starting to feel normal.

The distinct shapes made by those on the pitch and the angles they tend to inhabit the colouring and character of different grounds in different countries the proximity of players to crowds, and the room therein for visual interplay the evocative backdrops and improvised plots of amateur cricket, which tell their own stories and perhaps most uniquely, the value of time, or what Neville Cardus called cricket’s “occasional static quality”, opening up the space to capture the gaps between the action, when cricket people are often at their most revealing.The game’s iconography stretches back through the centuries, infusing us with images that bind the generations to cricket’s broader narrative arc. In Issue 34 of Wisden Cricket Monthly, a cohort of cricket lovers consider the value and power of cricket photography, and select the pictures that mean the most to them.Adrian Dennis, the Oval, 4 September 2000Moments earlier Courtney Walsh has been bowled by Dominic Cork in his final Test match on English soil, confirming England’s first series victory over West Indies for 31 years. The veteran fast bowler has been relentlessly magnificent throughout the summer but with the last rites complete he is suddenly just another face in the crowd, swamped by the jubilant home supporters. The image reminds me of a commuter on a packed railway platform, trying to navigate his way home. Jo Harman, WCM magazine editorThis was taken by my first boss, Adrian Murrell. It’s iconic, it’s Botham, you just know instantly what Test match that was and what had happened. And it’s so quintessentially cricket, with the dressing room set-up, with the whites and the sweater, and with everything hanging up behind him. It’s got a nostalgic feel to it, of an era when photographers could just wander in and start taking pictures. It wasn’t staged, it’s a totally natural image, though it’s been subsequently recreated – when Flintoff won in ’05 Tom Shaw got him with the cigar, and then after Ben Stokes’ innings after Headingley, Stu Forster asked if he could go in the dressing room to take the same picture. That one didn’t have a cigar but it had the same feel, of Stokes looking shattered and staring into space, thinking about what he’d just done. Gareth Copley, Getty Images photographerThe night women’s cricket reached unprecedented heights, with over 80,000 at the MCG and a record TV audience across the world. This joyful image of Australia’s T20 World Cup champions on stage with a global pop culture icon encapsulates the reach and appeal that the women’s game can achieve. It is a coming together of women’s sport and girl power. The selfie being taken at the front of the photo places it perfectly in the modern day, where social media has played a huge role in the accessibility and visibility of women’s cricket and its international stars. Alison Mitchell, broadcasterMike Atherton looks like he’s playing this ball from Courtney Walsh comfortably enough but the shine of the ball and the sheen of Jamaica’s Sabina Park pitch speaks of the monumental challenges England batsmen faced in the Caribbean. This is from an ODI on England’s ’94 tour. John Stern, WCM editor-at-largeIf and when time travel is developed, cricket fans will be queuing up to pop back to the Golden Age and watch Victor Trumper, whose magical skills and style prompted unequalled adoration, but whose batting is almost impossible to imagine. This rare, genuine action photo of the Australian legend (by George Beldam, the photographer who took the iconic shot of Trumper that inspired a book by Gideon Haigh over a century later), batting in his defining summer, in one of cricket’s most dramatic matches, offers a precious visual record of one of the sport’s defining geniuses.But it also hints at what cricket, its players, tactics and techniques, and its crowds, might have been in the early 20th century. It makes you wonder what happened to the invisible ball – did Trumper unfurl a moment of his trademark majesty, to be imprinted on the souls of the thousands present? Maybe he just patted it to the curiously upright extra-cover. This photograph cannot show us what it was like to see Trumper bat, but it can make us imagine what it would have been like to be a cricket fan watching him bat, to be seeing for ourselves a man who transported batsmanship on to a different aesthetic plane. Andy Zaltzman, comedian and TMS scorerI was a massive KP fan and still am. As an England supporter, the 1990s were such hard work and then suddenly, in 2005, KP arrived: brash, flamboyant, exciting and playing in a way that seemed scarcely credible. I was lucky enough to watch him score four Test hundreds live and had amazing seats for two days in a row at Lord’s when he scored his double-ton against India.This picture is full of joy, and a time before his tragic fall, and is a reminder of a great era of England cricket, of happy times although it makes me feel a little wistful too. Some incredible and dazzlingly exciting cricketers for England have followed but there was a dynamic freshness and uniqueness to Kevin Pietersen that I doubt will be seen again. James Holland, historianThis, taken from a hot air balloon in 1905, is the oldest known photograph of the Kennington Oval. Back when I first used to go there, the spectacle of cameramen perched on cranes high above the action always used to fill me with vicarious dread – but they had nothing on the man who took this snap. The camera was so heavy that he had to have someone cling onto him as he leaned out from the basket holding it. I am glad he made it back down safely to terra firma, and that he brought this photograph with him. I find it oddly moving. The distinctive curve of the stadium, the contours of the pavilion, the gas holders: a century and more may have passed, but so much stays the same. Tom Holland, historianPhotographs are significant because, when we look at them, they evoke particular memories and emotions. Heather Knight’s incredible innings at Wormsley against Australia in 2013 to save the Test is one that I am privileged to have seen in person it was also the first match which I reported on from the press tent. But I must admit that my main reason for choosing this photograph is a bit of a silly romantic one: my future fiancé Syd Egan is just about visible in the background, in a high vis motorcycle jacket. We hadn’t met even met at this point – but I love the thought that our paths might well have crossed at this match, without us even knowing it. Raf Nicholson, WCM’s women’s cricket correspondentIt was a scene that never should have happened after Lance Klusener struck Damien Fleming for two of the most gloriously timed clubs through cover as the World Cup semi-final reached its dramatic conclusion. It left four balls, one run to get for South Africa. Allan Donald’s error of judgment which followed prompted this defining moment, captured by the great Patrick Eagar. Adam Collins, WCM Australia correspondentCricket, more than perhaps any other sport, is a game of family ties. We play because our dads play, our little brothers play because we do. As kids, my brother and I bowled thousands of balls at each other – in the garden on a rough strip of concrete that covered the old septic tank in the attic bedroom of our house, where the main aim was to take the other’s head off with the heavy rubber ball on the boundary edge of our local club and other forgotten places too numerous to list.So on that famous evening in 2011, with older brother Niall watching on, Kevin O’Brien’s 50-ball century, the fastest ever at a World Cup, must have felt like the culmination of all those years of throwdowns, tantrums and lost balls. As cricketing brothers you guide each other through the many ups and downs of the game and are more invested in the other’s success than you’d ever want them to know. This is my favourite cricket photograph because it perfectly captures that feeling. Joe Provis, WCM chief designerIt was impossible to choose just one of all the amazing cricket photographs out there, so I’ve cheated. This photo is nine years old now but I still love everything about it: the miniature pads that my mother-in-law made, the policeman’s helmet headgear, the inexplicable choice of a pair of gardening gloves behind the stumps and, above all, the complete concentration on the boys’ faces. Lovely memories. Tanya Aldred, writerI had finished up from shooting the England team for the previous 13 years, covering almost every tour since 2000, and this marked a new beginning for me. I shot this as an editorial feature for All Out Cricket magazine and it was one of the first shoots I had done with Joe Root. A year previously, Michael Vaughan had told me that Joe would be the next England captain, so I knew he was destined to be a star. He was very relaxed and comfortable during the shoot, and there was a calm about him, like he knew he was on course to be one of the greatest batsmen England had produced. It was shot in the indoor school at Headingley and with the curtain behind him it feels like he is backstage, about to go out and perform. Tom Shaw, photographerMy dad, a land agent, had three things stuck to the wall behind his desk. One was a paragraph from an interview in which Tom Stoppard said that if he hadn’t been a playwright he’d have liked to be a land agent one was Yeats’ poem He Wishes For the Cloths of Heaven and one was Patrick Eagar’s photograph of Andrew Strauss catching Adam Gilchrist at Trent Bridge in 2005. It’s not just that it epitomises the exultation of that series. I love the way you can see Strauss’ shadow on the grass like an aircraft’s, and the way his mouth hangs open in his own astonishment at what’s happening, and the way the sightlines of umpire, bowler, batsmen and slip all converge on the ball – every vector of attention concentrated on that magical point in space. And there’s the wonderful feeling not just of looking at but participating in the picture, because Strauss’ e has left a gap where second slip should be, and that’s exactly where we find ourselves, sixth in the curve of onlookers, about to go up in celebration with Freddie and Tresco. Perfect moment and perfect composition – it’s got everything. William Fiennes, novelistIt’s an Eagar at Fenner’s but it’s the administrative-building backdrop that makes it and the administrative building makes me think of Gerhard Richter’s Administrative Building which he was painting and blurring, blurring and painting, nine years earlier. Here it’s 1973 already, the crowd of one sees Cambridge, I see Dresden, wonder what Jane Joseph sees. Beyond the ball, which she’s lashed. Incredible figures earlier, 10-7-7-3, now her game-high 23 not out is guaranteeing Trinidad beat Young England in a languid cliffhanger one-dayer. This was Joseph’s fourth game, she’d play two more only, still it’s six more than her namesake, Harold Joseph, same island, said to spin a ball both ways, both modes, wrist, finger, plus have six variations. The uniforms, their non-uniformity, are interesting. Big backstory there. And South Africans were supposed to be in this World Cup. The Trinidadians and Jamaicans said no, in brilliant defiance of the administrators who are likely seated, eating triangulated sandwiches, gasbagging, sucking up to whoever’s passing, not watching, eyelids three quarters of the way to shutting, within that administrative building. Christian Ryan, authorI was a cricket-obsessed 13-year-old when the mighty West Indies toured England in 1984. Although I’d read all about the players, I’d never seen them play in real life or even on the television. What I saw that summer was simply astonishing. Each of the West Indies players was magnificent to watch but as a team, they were just mind-blowing. I used to try to find a radio or a TV at every break to catch as much as I could before I headed back to the classroom. I remember thinking I didn’t need to bother on the last day of the second Test at Lord’s, as the match was obviously heading for a dull draw. I didn’t believe it when, mid-afternoon, I was told by my science master that the Windies were about to win the match. England had been seven down at the start of play and 300-odd ahead. David Gower had declared, setting an impossible target of 341. I saw the last hour of Gordon Greenidge and Larry Gomes in action. Greenidge made it look impossibly easy and completely controlled, even when ball after ball seemed to disappear to the boundary. Ever since I’ve batted in a short-sleeved jumper and a cap. I can confidently say that those are not the magic ingredients that make a good batsman. But it’s worth a try. I still dream of playing as good a shot as Greenidge in this photo. It might just happen, one day. Peter Frankopan, historianThe trouble is, I don’t really have a favourite photo. It depends on my mood. Should it be a peak action photo, one that shows cricket at its most athletic? Should it carry atmosphere, a special lighting effect perhaps? Should it portray a special moment? Should it feature a very famous player? I am going for a bit of nostalgia. This photo was taken at Lord’s during the final England v West Indies Test in 1973 and shows the scene as Geoff Boycott made his way back to the pavilion having been caught by Alvin Kallicharran on the boundary after hooking Keith Boyce in the evening session of the third day. It has a few period notes. Firstly there is no wild celebration amongst the West Indian fielders in spite of the fact that England, following on, were now three wickets down. However, the crowd are showing their appreciation in a way that is seldom seen today. For a start the spectators were allowed to sit on the grass at Lord’s (thereby increasing the capacity by a few thousand) and enthusiastic celebration was tolerated (up to a point). Look carefully and you can just see a policeman amongst the celebrations. By selecting a slightly shorter lens than usual (there were no zoom lenses in those days), I was able to include the players and the crowd in the same photo. What else is different? There were no advertising boards. Boycott was wearing a cap. In those days you faced fast bowlers without a helmet and with a minimum of padding. It was Garfield Sobers’ final Test in England, which he celebrated with an undefeated 150, as well as taking six catches in the match. He is my favourite cricketer and is seen with Rohan Kanhai in the centre foreground. In 1973 most photographs were taken in black and white. Mainly because that was what the market required. Newspapers, magazines and books were nearly always printed in black and white. Besides, colour was difficult to use for action photos with long lenses, simply because the film required lots and lots of light. To use the fast shutter speeds necessary for action photography in those days required really bright sunshine. Patrick Eagar, photographerI’d seen the wildness before, the place swaying and screeching to a human being’s breath as the game went on over there somewhere, a sideshow warm-up for the moment when a wicket falls and they swim to the steps for the door to open and the man to emerge, adjusting his eyes to his own light, a lifetime adjusting and adapting to weather the glare, and here now, for this last walk down those spattered steps as this version of himself, moving in to touch but just beyond reach, partitioned from the masses, their handheld reflectors held up to the sun.

It is a moderate to strenuous walk of almost five miles (longer if you choose the circular walk back to Fowey), but you will be rewarded with the discovery of secret beaches en route, where you can stop for a swim and take in the beautiful views. Another highlight is the shipwreck that inspired Daphne Du Maurier’s Rebecca at Polridmouth cove. End the walk with a seafood lunch at Sam’s on Polkerris beach (booking recommended) or a drink at the Rashleigh Inn next door, and watch the sunset on the beach. Natasha CouttsMy favourite clifftop walk is in Lerwick, Shetland. If you start along the Knab towards Sound, it is the most relaxing way to start or end the day. There are sheep who bleat like an old man, seals who are curious and playful and even an egg honesty box at a B\u0026ampB along the way. The colour of both the sea and the sky is grey-blue – sometimes it is hard to tell where the sky ends and the sea begins. If feeling brave, the pebbled beach offers an opportunity for a refreshing swim with the seals.Marie BourneMy tip isn’t so much a walk as a climb: the Elie chain walk. You edge your way along ledges and up and down steps in the cliffs, clinging on to chains anchored in the rock for the more precipitous sections – and there are lots of them. Consider it a via ferrata for beginners. I managed it with five- and eight-year-olds although, in truth, it’s probably unsuitable for most youngsters. But, then again, it’s so refreshing to come across this sort of exploration that hasn’t (yet) been stymied by the health and safety police. You will never forget the experience. Oh, and watch out for the tide times!Paul KirkwoodStart your walk in Bridlington – parking is free on the south side. The walk begins along Belvedere Parade and continues south along a path, past the hamlet of Wilsthorpe, then opening out on to a cliff edge path (which is sometimes awash with butterflies), eventually coming to an excellent coffee shop, the Cow Shed at Fraisthorpe beach. It’s about three miles to there. After coffee and cake with a superb view of the bay, return on the wide-open beach, easy underfoot and with sightings of seabirds and waders, as well as second world war sea defences. Six miles, great coffee, wide open views, an extensive beach, nature and history – all the ingredients of an excellent walk.Sarah VernauWhen adventuring with my family, access is our first consideration, as our little girl has a disability. My partner and I have always adored coastal walks, so we were blown away by the breathtaking circular walk called Baggy Point, just east of Croyde beach in north Devon. It is largely accessible (with the rare rocky patch) and has no shortage of jaw-dropping scenery. • nationaltrust.org.ukStephanieExpect to see wildlife along the picturesque Royal Military canal before crossing to Hythe seafront and enjoying the boardwalk and dramatic sea towards Sandgate. Check out the village’s short stretch of quirky shops, then cut back to the beach to spot some residual artwork from the Folkestone Triennial. Have a lolly at the beachside Mermaids Cafe when you reach Folkestone, then let the kids go wild in the amazing, free adventure park at the Lower Leas Coastal Park. Don’t miss the fabulous coastal planting, then zigzag your way back up the path for afternoon tea at the Grand. Promenade harbour-wards and take in the Channel views, pass the water lift and memorial arch, then finish at one of the vibrant new pop-up bars on the Harbour Arm.KateThere is an easy five-mile stroll on the Isle of Sheppey, beginning in bustling Leysdown-on-Sea. Heading eastwards, the rows of caravans drop away and the vast expanse of muddy sand is bequeathed to flocks of gulls and oystercatchers. The neat breakwaters of Leysdown give way to lines of jagged wooden posts, sticking up like shipwrecks out of the sand. Take a break at Shellness beach, made up entirely of tiny pastel-coloured shells. Then head through the bleakly beautiful Swale nature reserve, keeping the sparkling Swale estuary in view – a great place to spot seals basking on the sandbanks. After an afternoon of soul-cleansing isolation, finish at the Ferry House Inn for outstanding local fare.Alexandra McLanaghanI usually catch the train from Porthmadog to Criccieth, it’s only a few pounds. From Criccieth station head to the nearby castle (currently closed) before dropping down on to the beach path and past the glass-fronted, art deco Dylan’s restaurant, which is always worth a visit. The pebbly beach gives way to easier walking underfoot as you circumnavigate the headland, with fantastic views over Blackrock Sands and an easy walk along the beach, picking up the Welsh Coastal Path to the beautiful beaches before Borth-y-Gest (where the Sea View Cafe does great ice-cream) before finishing your walk into Porthmadog. It’s about five miles, three hours maximum, great at any time of year.Ian OwenThe Norfolk Coastal Path is best known for vast sandy beaches, tidal marshland and pine woods. But one outstanding section climbs from the pretty fishing village of Weybourne and stretches along clifftops overlooking the always dramatic North Sea. This walk defies the reputation of “flat Norfolk” with spectacular views across rolling fields, gorse, heather and woodland. Catch glimpses of steam trains puffing along the Poppy Line to Holt. Follow the path up to the lifeguard lookout point before dropping down into Sheringham. Ride the cute little Coasthopper bus back to Weybourne for lunch at the Ship Inn.NikkiSilecroft, on the Cumbrian coast, has a great beach, and this is a quiet and easy walk – close to the southern fringes of the Lakes, but well away from the tourist crowds. Famous for the opening credits of BBC’s Countryfile, with the horses running through the waves. At high tide there are pebbles but at low tide there’s a flat expanse of sand, as far as the eye can see to the north and south. If you’re lucky, you’ll see no one else. If unlucky you might have to share it with maybe 20 others. Head south for an easy walk on the sand for about four miles, enjoying the views across the sea to the Isle of Man, or inland to the local fells, until you get to the quiet, peaceful village of Haverigg.

Now he’s back in his most famous role in a comedy sequel It is hard to convey just how stratospherically famous Macchio, now 58, became when The Karate Kid – in which he played plucky lower middle-class teen Daniel LaRusso, crane-kicking the snotty rich kids – came out in 1984. Back in the 80s, a young person could become a huge star with just one movie and, to a large extent, those movies still define those actors: Tom Cruise had Risky Business, Matthew Broderick had Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, Michael J Fox had Back to the Future and Macchio had The Karate Kid.Nostalgia for those films and the deceptively basic (but actually tenaciously deep) joys they brought means 80s films are, once again, having a comeback, with the third Bill \u0026amp Ted film getting released next month in the UK, a fifth Indiana Jones apparently creaking out in 2022, and the official sequel to Dirty Dancing now in the works. But it’s The Karate Kid – seemingly the most simple of 80s blockbusters – that has unexpectedly had the most satisfying afterlife with Cobra Kai, the ludicrously enjoyable series that started on YouTube and has just been bought by Netflix.Cobra Kai is the ultimate fan fic, but in the best possible way. Created by Karate Kid superfans Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, it imagines what happened to Daniel and his nemesis Johnny (William Zabka) 34 years on from the famous tournament, with Daniel now a successful car salesman and Johnny a barely functioning alcoholic, until he decides to reopen a certain karate school. But what could have been pure self-indulgence becomes surprisingly rich and textured, as Heald, Hurwitz and Schlossberg take seemingly minor elements from the original film (most notably the social class differences between Daniel and Johnny, but also the cars, the houses and the great fan debate about whether Daniel cheated in the tournament) and blow them up into whole episodes that go to far deeper places than the movies touched upon.“Jon, Josh and Hayden know way more about the films than I ever did,” marvels Macchio. “We’ll be shooting a scene and they’ll say: ‘Remember that time you lifted your left arm? The way you pointed that finger was definitive to my childhood!’ I’m like: ‘Dude, I was just saying a line!’ Oh, it’s really wonderful.”One of the many joys of Cobra Kai is how many of the original cast members appear in it. As well as Macchio and Zabka there’s Martin Kove, who played the bullying Cobra Kai teacher Kreese, and Randee Heller, AKA Mrs LaRusso, Daniel’s mother. There is even a hint at the end of the second series that Elisabeth Shue, who played Daniel’s girlfriend Ali, might make a comeback. But there is one gaping absence and that is Mr Miyagi, Daniel’s sensei, played by the wonderful Pat Morita, who died in 2005.“That’s been tough,” says Macchio, who spoke at Morita’s funeral. “There’s a montage scene in series two in which I’m teaching a younger kid, just as Miyagi taught LaRusso, and that brought a real rush of emotion for me. Every time we shoot I hearken back to those early days of rehearsal with Pat.” And yet, as beloved as Mr Miyagi was as a character, even getting an Oscar nomination for his performance, some Asian Americans have since said that they felt stereotyped by him, getting teased about his exaggerated accent (which Morita put on for the part) and constantly fending “wax on, wax off” references. Was Morita aware of the criticisms?Macchio made three Karate Kid films with Morita, with diminishing returns – the original, though, remains a stone-cold classic – and there was a fourth with Hilary Swank and Morita. Will Smith attempted to revive the franchise in 2010, now set in China, with his son Jaden and Jackie Chan as the mentor. It had, shall we say, a mixed reception. Macchio, famously one of the nicest people ever to appear on screen, is too kind to trash it, saying only “It enhanced the legacy of the original,” and he allows himself to point out: “Also, there’s no such thing as karate in China, so it should have been called The Kung Fu Kid.”While pretty much every other successful young actor in the 80s went through some kind of emotional off-screen ordeal, Macchio remained straight and stable, mainly living with his parents on Long Island and marrying his childhood sweetheart, Phyllis, when he was 26. They are still together and have two children. Macchio’s steadiness – which he puts down to his “upbringing and natural sensibilities” – is so renowned that Funny or Die made a very amusing film in which the actor tries to behave badly to beef up his career. It’s a good joke, but there is some truth to it, Macchio admits, because he always put personal stability before fame.Macchio has always been remarkably good-natured about being so associated with Karate Kid, even though he has had a perfectly healthy career as a jobbing actor beyond it. His first big break was in Francis Ford Coppola’s The Outsiders, alongside Tom Cruise, Rob Lowe, Matt Dillon and Emilio Estevez, and Lowe recounts in his memoir how Macchio was the on-set joker.“I always try to go for the joke, maybe because I’ve always been the smallest guy or the youngest-looking guy, so that was my defence,” he says. (Incredibly, despite looking about 13, Macchio was 22 in Karate Kid.) His other best-known role was in My Cousin Vinny, and Macchio compares the famous chemistry between Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei with what he had with Morita. More recently, there have been steady TV roles in Ugly Betty and The Deuce.But Karate Kid retains a special place in his heart, so much so that he named his son, Daniel, after his character in the film. “There was a chunk of time when my son was like: ‘Did you have to?’ But now he’s proud of it. Unlike Ralph, Daniel is a classic, it never goes out of style, you know?”Cobra Kai seasons one and two are available on Netflix on Friday, with season three due later this year"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abea6c172005fdb1bdb58ec414cac103cc17fbcf/0_122_3200_1921/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85b09738ba0b4e5bc65248731d93bb7d","title":"iowa derecho storm photos farmers","story":"The hurricane-like storm, called a derecho, tore through Iowa this month, damaging buildings and threatening the harvest A rare inland storm known as a derecho passed through the state of Iowa on 10 August, leaving widespread damage in its wake.Winds reaching 140 miles an hour demolished many parts of the city of Cedar Rapids.

The sisters, both members of the Navajo Nation, shared an office at Tuba City Regional Health Care in Arizona. Cheryl conducted reviews to make sure patients were receiving adequate care. Corrina was a social worker. Their desks were just inches apart.They lived together with their mother, Mary Thinn. They helped raise each other’s children.And they died weeks apart, at ages 40 and 44, after falling ill with Covid-19.Lynette Goldtooth, a co-worker and close friend, can’t go near their workspace, afraid she may break down.“I used to sit in Cheryl’s chair.

In May, it reported the highest per-capita infection rate in the United States. The sisters are among nearly 500 members of the reservation who have died of the virus, according to the Navajo department of health.Experts attributed the spread to the prevalence of multigenerational housing and poor sanitation infrastructure – many homes lack running water. Like medical centers across the country, local hospitals across the Navajo Nation experienced shortages of personal protective gear.In early March, Corrina saw a patient who was later discovered to have had Covid-19, her sister Chris said. The patient died, and Corrina, who hadn’t been using protective equipment, developed symptoms a few days later.The sisters’ employer declined to comment for this story.Corrina’s first concern was for Cheryl, who started showing symptoms of the virus around the same time that she did. Cheryl’s job as a utilization review technician required face-to-face interaction with patients to verify their insurance and discuss workers’ compensation. She had underlying health conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis.Chris called Cheryl on her 40th birthday, on 19 March. Cheryl joked about how, as the baby of the four siblings, she was “still young and pretty”. But she also complained that it was difficult for her to breathe. She was admitted to the Tuba City hospital the next day.Corrina’s condition worsened as well, and she checked herself into the emergency room at Tuba City on 21 March. Hospital staff tried assisted-breathing treatments on her, to no avail.Cheryl was airlifted to Flagstaff medical center on 24 March. She never knew that Corrina was briefly in the hospital with her.Corrina was airlifted to Banner Thunderbird medical center in Glendale later that night.“She just messaged us saying she was going to get flown out, that she loves us and that she was going to be back,” Chris said.It was the last time she spoke with Corrina.Because of shortages, the sisters weren’t tested for Covid-19 until they were transferred out of Tuba City. They both tested positive and were then intubated at their respective hospitals. Cheryl died on 11 April, and no family members were allowed to be with her.“I couldn’t even hold my baby,” her mother said. “I couldn’t even hold her hand when she passed.”The family had a small service before burying Cheryl next to their late father, Sgt Jimmie Thinn Sr of the Navajo police, and Cheryl’s ex-husband, who died in January.Numbed by the pain of Cheryl’s death, the family shifted their focus to Corrina.“You tell yourself that we just need to get her healthy enough to come home,” Chris said. “And then all of the sudden, she’s gone.”Corrina died on 29 April – 18 days after her sister’s death and two weeks after her birthday, which she spent on a ventilator. Although she was unconscious, her nurse sang Happy Birthday.Corrina’s oldest son, Gary Werito Jr, had tried for weeks to take leave from his Fort Bliss army post in El Paso, Texas. His superiors declined his requests out of concerns he might contract the virus while on leave.Werito tried to reach her through prayer.“I was telling her, ‘Mom, you’re going to get through this. You’re going to come home. You’re going to meet your granddaughter,’” he said.Werito and his wife were expecting their second child, Corrina’s first granddaughter.Werito remembers his mother as a “model Navajo”.Goldtooth, the sisters’ friend and colleague, said Corrina was particularly effective because she spoke English and Navajo fluently.Cheryl was more soft-spoken than her sister. Mary remembers her as empathetic and insightful. Her siblings often sought her advice.Both sisters left behind young sons. Corrina’s son Michael is 14, and Cheryl’s son, Kyle, just turned 12. The cousins are keeping each other company, reminding Mary of the way her daughters behaved.In late July, Werito left the army for good and came home to Tuba City. His daughter was born on 5 August in the same hospital where his mother and aunt worked. Her middle name is Lois, the same as Corrina’s.Werito said he sometimes forgets his mother is gone and expects her to come home from work.“My grandmother told me it’s a little peace of mind that I’m home now,” he said. “It kind of fills that void that my mom and my aunt left.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc533564f980181c9ed642a976e73edd3c9a0d8a/0_74_6591_3955/master/6591.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=8cdc2f05045699fa024ba589d6fcc629","title":"bame britons less likely trust covid health officials survey","story":"Exclusive: findings raise fresh questions about pandemic’s disproportionate impactBlack and minority ethnic people trusted government scientists and public health officials less than white people did at the height of the UK’s coronavirus outbreak, according to a study that raises fresh questions about the pandemic’s disproportionate impact.BAME people were more likely to believe their employers’ advice than anything Boris Johnson or the government said, and trusted the NHS and Public Health England (PHE) less than white people did, the research suggests.At the same time they felt more vulnerable to the impact of Covid-19 and were far more likely to say it was difficult to follow the restrictions in place to prevent the spread of infection, according to the survey for the Wellcome Trust carried out in March and April as the virus reached its peak.The findings prompted questions about whether more could have been done to better communicate with different communities, with one council leader querying the impact of daily Downing Street briefings that were frequently presented by three white men.A PHE review found black people were the ethnic group most likely to test positive for coronavirus, and white people were the least. People of Bangladeshi ethnicity had about twice the risk of death than that for white people and mortality rates were higher for black and Asian groups when compared with white people. The study found socioeconomic factors, including more cramped housing, jobs that require increased human contact and greater use of public transport were key.“As Europe teeters on the brink of a second wave and we see more local lockdowns, these findings show that a more targeted approach to messaging will be key to ensuring that different groups can access, understand and trust government guidance,” said Carla Ross, a research and evidence lead at Wellcome. “We hope that local authorities and policymakers can use these findings to inform their public health strategies as we enter this critical period.”Arooj Shah, the deputy leader of Oldham council in Greater Manchester, which this month recorded the highest infection rate in the country, highlighted a possible barrier created by the daily Downing Street press briefings that often involved “three white men behind a podium telling you what you are doing”. She said: “You need to start looking like the people you represent.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/644fce9c4a3c28af89f2db8b2fd72980c6963b37/0_1225_2614_1567/master/2614.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97b67c17798120f4549237cf6c185ed7","title":"germany finds it hard to love hegel 250 years after his birth","story":"New books try to lighten up the intimidating reputation of Germany’s ‘most difficult’ philosopherIn March 1807, aged 36, a towering giant of German philosophy was struggling to come to terms with a career dip.With an illegitimate son to support and a patrimonial inheritance run dry, George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel had chucked in an unpaid academic post and accepted a job as an editor at a local newspaper in Bamberg, where he was compiling reports on royal boar hunts. Only a newly acquired coffee percolator offered brief caffeinated thrills.To make things worse, friends got in touch with feedback on his recently completed 600-page magnus opus, The Phenomenology of the Spirit. They found it hard going.The man Bertrand Russell later described as “the hardest to understand of the great philosophers” responded with a rare moment of self-doubt. Sometimes, he conceded, it was “easier to be sublimely unintelligible than to be comprehensible in a simple way”.The humbling Bamberg years feature prominently in three new biographies released in Germany around today’s 250th anniversary of Hegel’s birth, all searching for chinks in the intellectual armour of an intimidating influence on German public life.Because in spite of a raft of essays celebrating his relevance, numerous commemorative events and the reopening of his Stuttgart birthplace as a museum, Hegel’s formidable difficulty and fraught political legacy make him hard for modern Germans to embrace.“What surprised and pleased me alike during my research was that Hegel had a very meandering, non-linear CV,” said Sebastian Ostritsch, an academic at Stuttgart University and author of Hegel: The World Philosopher.While his philosopher friend Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, a student flatmate along with the poet Hölderlin, was made a professor aged 23, Hegel didn’t get a full professorship until his mid-40s, after leaving behind his short digression into journalism and accepting an academic post in Heidelberg.During his spell as a hack, the Stuttgart-born intellectual wrote a short unpublished essay that not only defied his reputation for long-windedness but tackled a common complaint about his philosophy: “Who thinks abstractly?” he asked in the eponymous essay. His answer: “The uneducated, not the educated.”Hegel’s view of history as a realm of non-linear but apparently inevitable progress was, however, later firmly embraced and adapted by Karl Marx, earning him a reputation in some circles as a proto-socialist. Others saw in Hegel’s ideas about the inidual and the state the seeds of the darkest chapters of twentieth-century totalitarianism.As a result, few contemporary German politicians are likely to evoke Hegel’s notion of the weltgeist – an invisible force advancing world history – with the gusto of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who wrote a university dissertation on the philosopher. Angela Merkel is more likely to quote Karl Popper, a noted anti-Hegelian.For Klaus Vieweg, a philosopher at the university of Jena and author of another biography, Hegel: Philosopher of Freedom, it’s all a “disastrous” misunderstanding caused by numerous misreadings. For him, Hegel was neither a covert revolutionary nor a champion of state control but a political moderate whose balancing of economic and social concerns was never more relevant than in pandemic times.“Hegel sketched out a counter vision to rapacious Wall Street capitalism that remains highly relevant,” Vieweg said. “He believed in the market as an indispensable basis for our society, but that the dominant principles of a modern state needed to be something else: freedom, justice and sustainability”.The image of a thinker strictly wedded to a vision of inevitable progress was off, Vieweg said: “Hegel was an optimist, but never a wide-eyed optimist. After the French Revolution, he was convinced that the idea of freedom could be put into people’s heads, but he never believed that would inevitably lead to a freer society.”Yet in the social climate of 2020 even mild Hegelian optimism seems a big ask, as commentator Andreas Rosenfelder wrote in a long article for German daily Die Welt, trailed on its front page with the promise “This Sunday, you will understand Hegel”.“The present age looks like an open war between reason and reality”, Rosenfelder wrote. “In the Hegelian year of 2020, this contrast is brought into sharper relief with every argument on Twitter, every pandemic wave, every autocrat’s election campaign. The world is slowly going mad, and we can only watch from the sidelines.”Hegel does not only present the problem but also can also provide a solution, the article argued. In times of conspiracy theories and filter bubbles, Hegel’s method of thinking – dialectics – can become a kind of intellectual self-help. Or as Jürgen Kaube summarises the philosopher’s central message in the third biography to be published this August: “Thinking is effective.”Earlier this month, German comedian Florian Schroeder showed how it could be done when he took to the stage at a protest of coronavirus sceptics in Stuttgart, Hegel’s birthplace.In a video of the event that has since gone viral, the comedian faces the crowd of hundreds who question the existence of Covid-19 and suspect face masks to be part of a plot to silence their critical opinions, telling them he wanted to talk about Hegel’s idea of dialectics, a method of argument that relies on a contradictory process between opposing sides.“Freedom doesn’t mean being irresponsible. Freedom which only expresses itself as irresponsibility is the end of freedom,” said Schroeder, as the boos grew louder. “Freedom means you have to suffer someone like me. That, my friends, is dialectics.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7c9a5f0d6604a288003210dc18cfabc2bbbd5dc/332_283_3157_1894/master/3157.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0e156bc67a76fa2319aa41a07b95f7c","title":"how do you feel about the uk government self isolation payment scheme","story":"We’d like to hear from people impacted by the new scheme which enables people on low incomes to claim payments of up to £182People on low incomes in areas with high coronavirus infection rates will be eligible for a payment of up to £182 if they are forced to self-isolate, the government has announced.The scheme, which will be trialled from Tuesday in Blackburn with Darwen, Oldham and Pendle, follows weeks of campaigning by regional mayors, councils and trade unions who warned that millions of people could not afford to isolate without pay for 14 days.We’d like to hear from people on low incomes on their thoughts on the new scheme.

Multilateralists have cause for optimism since a majority of those polled believe greater international cooperation could have reduced the impact of the pandemic.The poll, the first international comparative poll by Pew on the pandemic, suggests the disease has had a isive effect on the sense of national unity in many of the countries surveyed.Large majorities in Scandinavian countries, Australia and Canada say their country has been made more unified by the common experience of the pandemic, while the UK is ided over whether it has brought the country together.In Europe, those who have favourable opinions of rightwing populist parties such as Alternative for Deutschland are more likely than those in the centre and on the left to say ision has grown since the outbreak. This may reflect rightwing resentment at what is seen as big government imposing lockdowns and mandating the wearing of masks in public.Public attitudes towards their country’s handling of the pandemic and national unity are linked to feelings of trust in others and economic confidence, the Pew Centre says, but it is hard to detect whether low assessment of a government’s performance is driven by fears over the future of the economy or vice versa.The survey also found that in most countries women more than men reported that their lives had changed considerably due to the pandemic. Pew suggests this may be because of a disproportionate loss of part-time jobs, or the closure of schools leading to an increase in domestic pressures.Pew conducted the fieldwork among 14,276 adults from mid-June to the first week of August, just as a second wave threatened to break out in parts of Europe, meaning it potentially missed a further decline in confidence in those countries."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efa65f80f1a737ca5c813e02f4dd6cd235533fe1/0_269_6495_3897/master/6495.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bdf89b185de78fa22bb376145c1056a","title":"uk coronavirus live people on low pay to get covid isolation payment","story":"Dido Harding says service will continue to be built Ed Davey declared leader of Lib Dems Covid isolation payments could go beyond lockdown areas, says HancockOne of the country’s most senior police officers has said he is “disgusted” at a surge in recorded assaults against emergency services workers in England and Wales.Martin Hewitt, chairman of the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC), said constabularies would “use the full force of the law” to prosecute those accused of striking police officers, ambulance workers and fire crews.His comments came after latest figures showed the number of incidents in a four-week period rose by almost one-third compared with the same period last year.Josh Halliday reports on issues with England’s test-and-trace system, with one in seven home tests failing to produce a result:Public Health Wales said another person has died having tested positive for coronavirus, bringing its total number of deaths since the beginning of the pandemic to 1,595.The number of cases of Covid-19 in Wales increased by 35, bringing the revised confirmed total to 17,843.My colleague Simon Murphy reports that Switzerland and Jamaica are set to be removed from England’s travel corridor list, meaning arrivals from the countries will have to quarantine for two weeks.But Cuba, where the situation has improved, is likely to be added to the list. Ministers are waiting for the latest figures on the Czech Republic before they decide whether to add it as well. You can read the full story here:Kevin Lygo, ITV’s director of television, has been speaking at the (virtual) Edinburgh TV festival about the impact of coronavirus on the channel. “Production is back, generally speaking, a lot of issues are emerging as we start to film stuff, learning how to make big shows without audiences,” he said. “But for ITV it’s not been bad, to keep all the live shows on air through this, five days a week, six, seven hours a day, that was terribly important to us to inform people, to keep our schedule going.“We were looking at so many repeats of quiz shows in the morning if those shows had gone, it was terrifying.“The soaps were the next thing, because they did stop filming and I think now that they are back fully doing it, it has changed a bit but I still think it’s magnificent.“We made an early decision to halve the amounts of soaps we had on air and that enabled us to keep the soaps alive.”Addressing the process of getting dramas back up and running, Lygo said: “We have only started in the last week and quite a few more are gearing up. We had a couple of dramas interrupted and there is a logistical nightmare with actors’ time and directors’ time, but the industry is pulling together to understand there is a pecking order of when people can do shows.”He said that one unanticipated consequence was the number of new viewers watching during the day. He added: “Trying to put a positive spin on all of this, if all these people tried for the first time, hopefully they will stick around a bit longer because the ratings have been up ... It’s a good sign and I think public service broadcasters have shown how trusted they are.”He said the channel’s ad revenue “slightly fell off a cliff” but “we have seen it come back fast so far”.Pogba is not the only footballer to test positive for Covid-19. At least four Chelsea players have returned positive tests, Jacob Steinberg reported today, with others self-isolating after returning from holiday. And Aaron Wan-Bissaka, also of Manchester United, is facing a 14-day quarantine period after returning from Dubai (though he is not reported to have tested positive).The manager of the France football team, Didier Deschamps, has said that the midfielder Paul Pogba has tested positive for coronavirus.That means that the player will be unavailable for selection for France’s upcoming international fixtures.Tanguy Ndombele, who plays for Tottenham, has also been diagnosed with the virus and stood down from the French squad.Deschamps said of Pogba: “At the last minute, we had to make a change to the list because Paul Pogba had been on the list but, unfortunately for him, he took a test yesterday that came back positive this morning.” He has been replaced by Rennes teenager Eduardo Camavinga.That’s all from me, Caroline Davies. Handing back to Archie Bland now. More than 19,000 animals are stepping on the scales for their annual weigh-in at ZSL London Zoo as it warned of the “catastrophic” impact of the coronavirus crisis.Penguins, squirrel monkeys and camels were among the creatures to have their height and weight recorded on Thursday, which allows zookeepers to monitor their health and wellbeing.Forced to close for an unprecedented three months due to the pandemic, the Regent’s Park zoo says a loss of income from ticket sales has put a “huge financial pressure” on its operation, PA Media reports. Sir David Attenborough and comedians including Jonathan Ross and Catherine Tate have fronted videos aiming to raise funds for the Zoological Society of London, which runs London and Whipsnade zoos.More than £1m per month is needed to care for the animals and, while zoos were allowed to reopen on 15 June, social distancing means visitor numbers have been limited.A rise in confirmed coronavirus cases across Liverpool has prompted public health officials to issue an urgent warning, the Liverpool Echo reports. The last two weeks have seen a steady increase in the rolling weekly total, although it is lower than in other areas that have restrictions in place.The cases are not confined to a specific area but are across the city, and the data shows that adults under 40 account for half of the confirmed cases.Public Health England data shows the number of new Covid-19 cases in the city reached 84 in the seven days up to 19 August. The previous week had seen 61.With schools set to reopen next week, people are being urged remain vigilant to help try and avoid cases in the community and in schools and colleges, the paper reports. As a result, a renewed appeal is being made, particularly to under-40s, to respect social distancing, wearing of face coverings, and to abide by limits on household mixing and get tested if experiencing symptoms. Hi. Caroline Davies here, taking over the blog for a while. You can get in touch on caroline.davies@theDido Harding, the interim executive chair of the National Institute for Health Protection, said: “We will continue to build the service further to reach more and more people and to scale up our testing capacity by expanding our network of testing sites and investing in new technologies.”Nicola Sturgeon has provided a breakdown of testing figures for young people as she attempts to reassure parents about the risks to pupils returning to school.She said that this showed that parents should be vigilant “but not unduly concerned”, and reminded parents of the particular symptoms that merited booking a test.She also confirmed that police would from today have additional powers to break up house parties, which have been identified as a source of transmission in a number of recent clusters.She directed a message specifically to young people: “This is not about trying to stop people having fun. We are not trying to police your social lives … but for the overall health and wellbeing of the country it needs to be done safely and responsibly.”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Dismantling of protections \u0026lsquois making it harder for future administrations to use science\u0026rsquoLoss equivalent to an ice sheet over landmass of Ireland to a depth of 300 metresDiesel and petrol consumption fell as transport restrictions took hold, report shows"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"The by-the-wind sailor\u0026rsquos sworn foe, the violet sea snail, floats upside-down alongside itMichael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Bewley’s cafe on Grafton Street in Dublin has reopened after announcing it was to permanently close earlier this year.The cafe was opened to customers again on Thursday morning and is initially offering table service and a limited menu.Paddy Campbell, artist and owner of Bewley’s cafe, said “we’re really happy to be back open again” despite operating at less than a fifth of its capacity.“We have to be conscious of Covid so we can only let in so many people at a time, we have the capacity for 400 people in this building,” he said.“At the moment we can only let in 50 so we have one-fifth of our capacity. That’s not an easy burden to carry but we believe that the values are very important, that Bewley’s is a legacy, Bewley’s is something that we have a commitment to keep going and we hope that the public will support us.“We can’t take in enough people to pay the rent obviously but as the business builds we hope the public will support us and support their own cafe because this cafe belongs to Dublin, not to me, not to anybody else, to Dublin and therefore it’s very important that we all participate in not just opening it today but keeping it open.”The cafe had been closed since March 16th, when the Government introduced lockdown restrictions and the decision to close the cafe permanently was announced in May.The cafe’s 110 staff had been informed on July 1st that they were being made redundant, with the closure blamed on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy, and the €1.5 million annual rental cost on the protected structure.The cafe has been loss making for several years with the rent accounting for 30 per cent of its annual sales.It emerged at the end of last month that Bewley’s had agreed to pay more than €749,000 in rent arrears and interest costs to Ronan Group Real Estate (RGRE), the landlord of the cafe. RGRE is controlled by property developer Johnny Ronan.Cól Campbell, son of Paddy and managing director of Bewley’s, said the future of the cafe largely depends on Dubliners and that “they see it as relevant”.“It will require a deep commitment but we’re up for the challenge,” he said. “In May things looked really bleak, that was the pit. What changed was the journey that we went on... the changing health outlook, perhaps a less bleak economic outlook and a great belief in the resilience that Bewley’s has shown almost over two centuries of life.”Bewley’s Oriental Cafes Ltd first opened on Grafton Street in 1927.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4339638.1598472921!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pandemic is close to having us lock down the country again donnelly","story":"The Minister for Health.

The public health advice is that we are at a tipping point and we are doing everything we can to suppress this virus to stop a second lockdown”.He said that if a second lockdown were to happen, healthcare services will be “severely curtailed”. Currently, the strategy is to use “targeted measures to suppress the virus while keeping as much of our society and our economy open as possible”. He argued that the experiences of Kildare, Laois, and Offaly showed that suppressing the virus through this strategy was possible.He warned, however: “If there is a second wave the Government will have to consider the blunt instrument which we know works, that is, a lockdown. We are doing everything we can to avoid that.”He raised the prospect of lockdown measures still in place in Co Kildare being lifted, if the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) agrees. The profile of the disease will be discussed at a meeting of the team on Thursday.“If the restrictions can be lifted early based on public health advice, they most certainly will be,” he said.‘Comprehensive winter plan’The warning came as the Department of Health confirmed a further 164 cases of the disease had been diagnosed in the State, and no new deaths linked with the virus. As of midnight on Tuesday, there have been a total of 28,363 diagnoses, and 1,777 deaths in the Republic.Mr Donnelly said that the winter plan for the health services is being produced several months early, and will be the “most comprehensive winter plan that has ever been launched”, but he warned that “because of the costings involved . . . it will not be cheap”.At an earlier Committee session, Health Service Executive head Paul Reid said that the plan was “not just about a winter plan”, and that the HSE board is finalising plans “for a set of funding that will see us through the winter and through 2021”.This will involve a range of significant, different approaches aiming to keep people out of hospitals,” he said.Mr Donnelly also said that “we may well end up at a public inquiry” into deaths in nursing homes in the State and that he is “open to the idea”. However, referencing the Scally report into Cervical Check, he said the right approach may not be a public inquiry, and that the best approach for the families of those who had died should be adopted.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4340148.1598533179!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"von der leyen asks government for man and woman as candidates to replace phil hogan","story":"European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has called on the Irish government to propose a man and a woman for the role of Irish commissioner in the wake of Phil Hogan\u0027s resignation. Video: European Commission\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer European commissioner Phil Hogan and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Photograph: Stephanie LecocqEPA.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has asked the Government to suggest a man and a woman as candidates for the position of Irish commissioner following the resignation of Phil Hogan. Dr von der Leyen said that she had “respect” for Mr Hogan’s decision to resign, which came after days of discussions with him to establish his movements in Ireland in which it emerged he had not observed the 14-day period of self-isolation required for incoming travellers from Belgium. “Over the past days I discussed with Phil Hogan about his movements in Ireland, in light of information that emerged regarding respect of public health guidelines in Ireland,” the president said.“In the current circumstances as Europe fights to reduce the spread of the coronavirus and Europeans make sacrifices and accept painful restrictions, I expect the members of the college to be particularly vigilant about compliance with applicable national or regional rules or recommendations.”Dr von der Leyen said it was now up to the Irish Government to “present suitable candidates” to serve in the Commission for Ireland, and that she would ask for a man and a woman to be forward for her consideration.Achieving a gender balance among the commissioners was a goal set by Dr von der Leyen when she took up her post at the end of last year.Ireland is not guaranteed to retain the influential trade portfolio that Mr Hogan held as she can opt to reshuffle her cabinet, and this is understood to depend on the experience of the candidates put forward. Dr von der Leyen said she had not yet decided on the issue.“At a later stage I will decide on the final allocation of portfolios in the college of commissioners,” she said.In the interim, the trade brief will be managed by the Latvian official Valdis Dombrovskis, who is executive vice president of the European Commission.Second chanceMeanwhile, former German MEP Elmar Brok has said that Phil Hogan deserved a second chance and he had been the “perfect” trade commissioner.Speaking on RTÉ radio’s Today with Claire Byrne show Mr Brok said he very much regretted the resignation, but that nobody was so strong that they could not be replaced. “A second chance would have been a good thing.”Mr Brok said he could not predict if Ireland would keep the trade portfolio and that Mr Hogan had been chosen “on purpose” for the role.When asked about possible replacements, Mr Brok said former taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Simon Coveney or MEP Mairead McGuinness would be very strong candidates for the position.“But, they have no experience as a commissioner, as Phil Hogan had – still, someone from that circle might give Ireland a chance of keeping the trade portfolio.”Mr Brok added he hoped he could stay in personal contact with Mr Hogan and that the former commissioner could still play a role in pubic life. “He’s still a young man.”Dublin MEP Barry Andrews said he expects Dr Von der Leyen to appoint a woman to the trade role because she is very ambitious to achieve gender balance in the Commission. Speaking to RTÉ radio’s News at One Mr Andrews said the departure of Phil Hogan was “an enormous strategic loss for Ireland”. It had been inevitable when Mr Hogan had been “too slow” to apologise and after he “stood over his misinterpretation” of the Covid guidelines.Mr Andrews, who is a member of the Trade Commission, said it was a portfolio of enormous importance with “massive issues coming down the line.”Mr Hogan’s appointment as Trade Commissioner had been “an enormous triumph” for Ireland, he added.While he was against the appointment of “a technocrat”, if that was the cost, it would be worth it, he said.Nobody would want their name to go forward and not be successful, he said of the possible nominees.

Michel Barnier said he was disappointed, concerned and surprised by the lack of progress displayed in discussions that took place in Brussels this week, reiterating that at this stage an agreement between the two sides still looked unlikely and that there was a risk the two sides would fail to ratify a deal by the end of the year. “Too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards,” Mr Barnier said at a press conference following the conclusion of the latest negotiations. “I simply do not understand why we are wasting valuable time.” The failure to advance the discussions that began on Tuesday evening leaves only a narrow window in which to agree the text of a trade agreement, translate it into multiple European languages and obtain ratification before the post-Brexit transition period ends on December 31st. While both the UK and EU insist they want a deal, EU officials decried a lack of momentum on the British side in the wake of Thursday’s session, with one describing it as “puzzling”. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, acknowledged in a separate statement that there had been “little progress” during the week’s talks, but he also insisted that a deal remained possible even if it would not be easy to achieve.State aid and fisheriesThe EU wants the two sides to push towards a common understanding on the topics of state aid and fisheries, rather than leaving these highly sensitive topics until later in the talks, but British negotiators are seeking to advance to a legal text in other areas where the two sides are closer together.Lord Frost criticised the EU’s approach on Friday. “The EU is still insisting not only that we must accept continuity with EU state aid and fisheries policy, but also that this must be agreed before any further substantive work can be done in any other area of the negotiation, including on legal texts,” he said. “This makes it unnecessarily difficult to make progress.”Mr Barnier complained that he was not seeing any willingness on the UK side to take on board the EU’s priorities, adding that the need for a “level playing field” that ensures fair competition in areas including state aid would not go away and was a non-negotiable precondition to any trade deal.“No international agreement was ever reached without the parties agreeing to common rules,” he said. The notion of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement without level playing field provisions and a balanced deal on fisheries was a “non-starter” for the EU, and the absence of progress in these areas was blocking everything, he warned.British negotiating officials said the talks were stalling due to the problematic issues of fishing and state aid, over which they accused the EU of seeking to maintain the status quo.“What is frustrating is that Barnier wants to see us continuing arrangements very like those we had as members of the EU. The principle of ‘Brexit means Brexit’ is a good one and should be applied across the board,” the official said.“The process block now is that we must accept their position on state aid and fisheries before we can talk about anything else. We’re obviously not going to do that, so we’re frozen.”Key concernsMr Barnier confirmed that the UK had presented a draft legal text for the trade deal during the round of talks, but he added that this had not addressed the EU’s key concerns, serving instead as a reminder of the UK’s existing positions.Lord Frost added that the UK was seeking a relationship that ensures Britain regains “sovereign control of our own laws, borders, and waters” and is similar to other agreements struck by the EU elsewhere. “When the EU accepts this reality in all areas of the negotiation, it will be much easier to make progress.” A dinner between Mr Barnier and Lord Frost was held on Thursday evening after negotiations concluded, which officials suggested was tense following the lack of progress. “It was a very nice dinner, we had courteous and friendly discussions but we didn’t hide the difficulties between us,” one inidual said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed top baby names england wales 2019 popular name","story":"It can be one of the most difficult decisions new parents have to make - choosing the name of your child which they will carry through life, shaping how they are perceived by their peers or even their opportunities in life.The question is  - do you play it safe and walk the tried and tested route or go out on a limb? An ordinary name that doesn\u0027t draw attention or something more outlandish?The Office for National Statistics (ONS) have now revealed the most popular baby names for last year, with detailed stats on exactly how many children were given each name in England and Wales.You can search for your name via the interactive tool below to see whether a name is going in or out of fashion.Did parents in 2019 beat Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds to the name Wilfred - which languished in 143rd place in the 2018 rankings of boys names with just 383 births?Amid the Royal fallout have British parents followed Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s lead after the birth of Archie last year? In previous years new parents in Britain have been generally reliable in their most common picks for the top names, and this year is no different.For the three years to 2018 Oliver and Olivia were crowned the most popular baby names in England and Wales, and this year they cemented that status.Oliver has been the most popular boys\u0027 name since 2013 while Olivia replaced Amelia in top place in 2016.Among the top boy\u0027s names Alfred, Chester, Hudson, Ibrahim and Oakley entered the 2019 top 100 - replacing Alex, Dexter, Dominic, Kai, Sonny and Tobias.Lara and Mabel replaced Aisha and Francesca in the top 100 girls’ names Mabel has not been in the top 100 since 1924.In 2019, Freya and Lily entered the top 10 replacing Ella and Emily. This is the first time Freya has been in the top 10 most popular girls’ names, while it is the first time Emily has not been in the top 10 since 1984. Margaret and Mary were the only girls’ names to have featured in the top 10 for a longer period of time than Emily.In contrast to the top 10 girls’ names, there were no new entries in the top 10 boys’ names. Arthur continued its recent rise, now at its highest position since records began in 1904 as the fourth most popular boys’ name, 11 years since returning to the top 100.The regional variation in top boys’ names continued in 2019 when, despite Oliver being the top name in England and Wales overall, it was only top in the East Midlands, the East of England, the South West and Wales.Muhammad remained the most popular boys’ name in the North West, Yorkshire and The Humber, the West Midlands, and London while Harry and Arthur were the most popular boys’ names in the North East and South East respectively. Of all the Arthurs born in England and Wales, a fifth were born in the South East.David Corps, vital statistics outputs branch at the ONS, said: “Oliver and Olivia continued their reign as the top boys’ and girls’ names in 2019, but analysis shows choices in baby names can differ depending on the mother’s age. We found younger mothers opted for more modern girls’ names like Harper, which has seen a rise since the Beckhams named their daughter so in 2011, and shortened boys’ names like Freddie. In contrast, older mothers chose more traditional names such as Jack and Charlotte.”Which names have been driven by celebrity and popular culture? Has the rise in popularity in some names been born out of new music and films, and which names have faded into obscurity?Since 2016, when the Amazon Alexa was first available in the UK, the girls’ name Alexa has decreased in popularity from 2016 when there were 332 girls named Alexa to just 39 in 2019.In contrast, a girls’ name that may have increased following the rise to fame of a celebrity is the name Dua. Dua Lipa, the popstar, had her first UK number one single in 2017. In that time, the number of girls named Dua has doubled from 63 in 2017 to 126 in 2019 this is the highest number since our annual records began in 1996.Similar trends have been seen in boys’ names where the name Taron has increased in popularity, with 48 boys born in 2019 being given this name, the most since detailed records began in 1996. This choice in name might be influenced by the actor Taron Egerton who starred in the 2019 award-winning Elton John biopic, Rocketman.Continuing the cinematic trends, the name Kylo appears to have increased in popularity since the release of the new Star Wars sequel trilogy. Kylo Ren, a leading character, first appeared in 2015. Since then, the number of boys named Kylo has risen from 10 to 67 in 2019.Despite the last season of Game of Thrones leaving fans disappointed, names from the fantasy series are still cropping up on birth certificates, with four girls named Daenerys in 2019.Looking back to 1996, when detailed annual rankings of baby names first became available, we have seen names rise and fall and some all but disappear completely.The first name Corbyn faded into obscurity in 2019, with fewer than two babies named Corbyn in the same year the former Labour leader crashed to a devastating election defeat.The ONS suppresses any figures fewer than two, and it is the first time there have been no entries for Corbyn since 1996. In 2018 12 baby boys were named Corbyn.The girls’ names Brittany and Kerry were reasonably popular 20 years ago, with Brittany the 101st most popular name in 1999, and Kerry was 136th in 1996. However, in 2019, there were two or fewer children given these names.There were similar cases for boys’ names. In 2019, there were two or fewer boys named Kieren or Glenn for the first time since our detailed annual rankings were first available in 1996.Kieren’s highest rank was in 1997 when it reached 169th position. The more popular spelling of this name, Kieran, has declined too, decreasing from 89th position in 2010 to 374th in 2019. Meanwhile, Glenn was once the 95th most popular boys’ name in 1964.The steepest fall from the top 100 boy\u0027s names in 1996 is the name MacAuley, which held 95th spot but has since fallen to rank 2,488, with eight births in 2019.For the first time this year there were no entries for the boy\u0027s name Neville, suggesting the name is facing extinction. There were also two or less baby girls named Debra, though there were four girls named Debbie.Other names thought to be extinct have clawed their way back this year - notably Nigel. Not a single baby had the name on their birth certificate in 2016, but last year nine new Nigels came into the world.  The statistics are derived  from the names as they appear on the birth certificate of the child and, as such, don\u0027t factor in differing or similar pronunciations. Grouping names with similar pronunciation would change the rankings.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"europe last waking lockdown folly","story":"Did you hear it? Beyond the second wave sirens and the schools debate, the sound of the penny dropping on the global stage. In recent days, world leaders have hinted at an extraordinary admission: lockdowns are a disaster, and we can’t afford to repeat the mistake.Still, when that spiritless reverend of the global order Angela Merkel delivered this confession a few days ago, she was so officiously ambiguous that the world paid no attention. “Politically, we want to avoid closing borders again at any cost, but that assumes that we act in coordination,” she droned at a summit in the Mediterranean. And with that, an earthquake: saving lives “at any cost” has been excised from the lexicon of liberal internationalism. Instead the aim is to save the economy. This means “acting in coordination” to kill off second lockdowns.Emmanuel Macron was the first leader to drop this little bombshell. Last week he said that France can’t cope with the “collateral damage” of a second lockdown, explaining that “zero risk never exists in any society”. Italy joined in three days later, with the health minister hinting that the country will not return to national hibernation. Meanwhile, after lauding China’s draconian lockdown, the World Health Organisation (WHO) is imploring countries to avoid battening down the hatches again.About time. Lockdowns are officially indefensible. Sweden has won the international experiment, as its firms outperform even the German Großunternehmen while Covid deaths plummet in line with the rest of Europe. Scientists caution that it may take years to develop a vaccine. Economists warn that even the richest economies in the world cannot afford national lockdowns costing up to 3 per cent of GDP per month.Perhaps even doom-mongering politicians have twigged that civilisation threatens to evaporate into a mushroom cloud of psychoneurotic delirium. Polling reveals that Westerners on average believe 6 per cent of their national populations have died from Covid-19. The real figure is around 100 times lower.Or maybe global leaders have been terrified by their instinct to protect the status quo. After all, seasonal travel shutdowns are an existential threat to a borderless Europe. Italy’s collapse following another lockdown would bankrupt the Eurozone. The banal rituals of cosmopolitanism are under threat – from the professional class’s daily pilgrimage into the cities to Starbucks lattes in reusable cups.The trouble is, if Britain is any guide, leaders will struggle to persuade the masses to keep calm and carry on. Risk-averse statesmen aren’t ideal poster children for the message that we must all learn to live with more risk.More importantly, no leader dare tackle the toxic relationship between mass panic and “the science”. Take the problem of dodgy Covid statistics. The bizarre failure of politicians to explain to people the basic fact that “rising” cases could partly reflect an increase in testing is a scandal. So is their inability to point out that, far from being cause for alarm, mild upticks may be an encouraging sign that testing and tracing is working, as the system becomes more effective at picking up localised spikes.Nor do governments have a handle on the spurious second wave modelling that could yet drive us into another lockdown. It is, however, a myth that politicians are helpless against the judgment of career scientists. In Britain and beyond, politicians have never followed the modelling modelling has always followed the politicians.As the pandemic hit, officials across the world requested forecasts for long-term worst-case scenarios, even though it is widely held in expert circles that statistical models are only accurate for roughly two-week stretches. Worse, part of the reason the science has come up with ridiculous solutions is that politicians have asked ridiculous questions.As government adviser Prof Mark Woolhouse recently told a parliamentary committee:“We are not aiming the models at the right target we are aiming them at everyone when in fact the burden of this disease is very concentrated.” Perhaps the number crunchers would do better to model social distancing measures directed at the vulnerable rather than population-wide lockdowns.Sadly, world leaders are less interested in taking the science debate forward than in covering their backs. Their expediency will only fuel paranoia. After an intriguing U-turn from the WHO, face masks are being rolled out as a mass market placebo from Britain to Spain. The notion that they reassure more people than they alarm – let alone the evidence that they work – is risible. Still, they usefully distract from the incompetence of Western states when it comes to the routine mass testing that could genuinely quiet hysteria and avert new lockdowns.And so the Covid saga rumbles on. A grim tale of Machiavellian idiocy, statistical illiteracy, and robotic leaders who have no idea how to level with voters. Still, at least they have realised their lockdown error. It’s a glimmer of hope to which we must cling.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"republican presidential hopefuls use spotlight jostle 2024 nomination","story":"Mike Pence\u0027s address to the Republican National Convention was the latest by a string of prominent Republicans to use the limelight to position themselves for the 2024 presidential race.As Vice President, Mr Pence has positioned himself squarely behind Donald Trump, and will be one of the frontrunners in the race to succeed him.Addressing the convention live from Fort McHenry, in Baltimore, the site of an unsuccessful British assault in 1814, Mr Pence offered a full-throttle endorsement of the US president and their accomplishments over the last four years.The Vice President did not hold back on his attacks on Joe Biden, calling the Democrat a Trojan horse for the radical left who would put America on a path of socialism and decline.But Mr Pence has also sought to quietly differentiate himself from the US president, steering clear of Mr Trump\u0027s most isive and explosive comments.The Vice President is aware that, in as little as three months, the race to succeed Mr Trump could well be underway.It is not just Mr Pence who has hinted at his presidential ambitions - Nikki Haley, the former UN ambassador, and senator Tim Scott have both stoked speculation about their own futures with their keynote addresses at this week\u0027s convention.All three speakers devoted a large amount of their speaking time to spell out their backstories, taking care to thoroughly introduce themselves to the American public.Mr Pence discussed his Christian roots and his strong family network, a reminder of his crucial role in securing the support of white evangelical voters for Mr Trump in 2016.Ms Haley shared the story of her Indian parents\u0027 journey to the US, describing how their success led her to become the first female and first Indian governor of South Carolina, a validation of the American Dream.Mr Scott, the sole black Republican senator, detailed how his family went from cotton to Congress in one lifetime with his electoral success in an overwhelmingly white district in South Carolina.While Mr Pence\u0027s speech offered a ringing endorsement of Mr Trump, Ms Haley and Mr Scott offered more measured speeches, carving out their own political identities.All presidential hopefuls know they must balance a delicate tightrope ahead of November\u0027s election. If the Republicans lose the White House and control of the US Senate, as some polls suggest they will, a reckoning over the party\u0027s future seems inevitable. On the other hand, an election victory could cement the Republican Party\u0027s position as the party of Trump for years to come.But in the event of a resounding Trump victory, the president\u0027s natural successor may not be his deputy Mr Pence - but his eldest son, Donald Trump Jnr, who also addressed the convention this week.An articulate speaker, Donald Jnr has publicly hinted at his interest in a future run for office, and shares his father\u0027s talent for connecting with the party\u0027s voter base.The younger Mr Trump has previously been called Trumpier than Trump on account of his bellicose rhetoric and willingness to delve into controversies when it comes to his discussions of racial tensions and other sensitive topics.One thing is clear: win or lose, President Trump could play a decisive role in who succeeds him.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"interactive map reveals coronavirus cases rising local area","story":"People in England can use the Government tool to look up Covid- data for their local area.To visit the map website, click here.On mobile, enter your postcode, zoom in and click on the dot to reveal your local area.

Usually there is at least a soloist,not a full choir leading the audience, but of course this year the public seats in the hall will be empty because of the virus, and the voices on stage silenced.Now, the lyrics of both songs are pro-colonial. If you ban them from the Last Night of the Proms, ending a tradition going back decades, what consequences will that have Certainly, someone  years from now will say we shouldn’t have done that.It is the same argument for not taking down statues. If you remove statues because that person stands for something evil in their past, you are removing the deed too.Manipulating history only adds to mistrust among the black community.I would like to see the survey that says the public want these two songs taken out of the Proms programme, because it appears to me that the public hasn’t been consulted.Rule, Britannia! was written by Scottish poet James Thomson and he features on the famous Scott Monument in Edinburgh, near where I live.He is also commemorated in Westminster Abbey’s Poets’ Corner, next to William Shakespeare.If we say we must remove his words from the Proms, do we then remove the memorials too Rule, Britannia!, written and set to music in , was mentioned in James Joyce’s novel, Ulysses. It is part of my history and my culture. If we take it away, we take away part of my culture.It’s a song about the power structure at the time, and the arrogance and hypocrisy of Britain vowing to “never be slaves” while at the same time owning and benefiting from about , black chattel slaves in the West Indies who were called ‘property’.Of course, people are sensitive to its meaning, as well as Land Of Hope And Glory, the music of which was written by Edward Elgar.It doesn’t mean we should hide it.I personally don’t find the lyrics offensive because they are a true representation of the terrible truth at the time.If you take that away, then you are replacing history with a fairy story.There is also the possibility that it was written to show the evil of the time, rather than glorying it.The objection is that Rule, Britannia! is used by flag-waving “prommers” as a jubilant finale at the Proms.It is used in the wrong context, and that is part of the ignorance of our society of our history.It’s the same with Amazing Grace, which was written by a slaver of black people and is sung as a religious anthem.Recently, it was proposed that we should ban Swing Low, Sweet Chariot at rugby matches due to its link to slavery. That came to nothing.Instead of banning such songs or stripping away their lyrics, we need to educate people on the history of slavery, starting with putting it on the history curriculum.From speaking to people about slavery, the one constant reaction is always: “Why didn’t anyone tell us this before ”At the Proms, instead of taking the words away, we should put an explanation in the programme. We should tell people it’s about enslaving black people, making money from them, giving them a short le span and then compensating the slave owners when it was abolished because slaves were regarded as ‘property’.If they want to sing it after reading that, then fine, go ahead and sing it. But I bet they won’t sing it as joyfully as they might have done before.When I worked in research, I once had a lovely technician who worked for me. She looked after me so well, and she went to the Proms.If she knew the history of those two songs, being my friend, I doubt she would have sung along.It wasn’t her fault that she didn’t know the history.Those songs didn’t have a place in the Proms in the first place, they are there because of people’s ignorance. I would challenge anyone to know their meanings and still sing them in a frivolous capacity.But we shouldn’t be bothering ourselves about whether those songs should now be removed.What we should be bothering ourselves about is increasing the representation of black people who are the descendants of slaves. We should be concerning ourselves about making sure black people from the Windrush generation get compensation. And we should also be ensuring ourselves that every child is taught the history of slavery so that they can make their own minds up about whether to sing songs like these.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At last, after an unprecedented lockdown of six months, all schools are due to re-open, representing a giant leap back towards normality. But the damage caused by the Coronavirus disruption has been severe.Many parents have been prevented from ing to work. Young people’s education has been badly undermined, especially because the quality of online learning has been so uneven. One study found that a fth of pupils had less than an hour’s instruction a day. Moreover, social activities and friendships – which are a vital part of growing up – have been heavily restricted.The exam chaos over the last fortnight was a fitting symbol of the vacuum created by the absence of proper schooling. No advanced society canwhen a vital sector like education is temporarily paralysed. That is why it is so important that the Government succeeds in its goal of seeing a fullto the classroom. As Boris Johnson put it at the weekend, “it is vital for pupils’ education. It is vital for their welfare. It’s vital for their physical and, indeed, mental well-being.”Given the Government’s mixed record on its management of the Covid crisis, this will be a big test. From the inadequate supply of protective gear to the botched imposition of quarantine rules, Ministers have got it badly wrong at times. They cannot afford another fiasco next week.But to do that, they will have to curtail the influence of militant teaching unions, which thrive in a climate of scare-mongering and grievance. Full of negativity, these hardened left-wing operators turn every pebble of dficulty into a giant boulder of obstruction. They are the abominable no men and women, the ultimate “can’t do” brigade.To overcome the unions’ capacity for trouble-making, reassurances about safety will be absolutely crucial. Most teachers are keen to go back to work, but they want to know schools will not be dangerous environments. That is why the recent upbeat advice from medical experts has been so welcome. It is clear from the Covid experience around the world that not only are children less likely to transmit the disease than any other group, but also that schools are safer than most other workplaces. Yesterday, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries pointed out that a child is more likely to be involved in a traffic accident or die from flu than to be harmed by Coronavirus.That message was also spelt out by her boss Chris Whitty, who said on Sunday that the damage to health caused by a continued schools lockdown is potentially greater than the impact of Covid. “The balance of risk is very strongly in favour of children going to school,” he declared, adding the chances of catching the disease “are incredibly small.” In fact, there is now hard evidence to prove this. Although the vast majority of schools were closed since March, over one million pupils – such as the children of essential workers – went back to the classroom in June. Yet a comprehensive study by Public Health England showed that in the subsequent weeks until the end of term, just  children and  staff tested positive for Covid- – and nearly all these infections occurred outside the school. There were hardly any cases of children passing on the disease to each other, or to their teachers. Other research from around the world has come to the same conclusion.But none of this seems to matter to the teaching unions, eager to exploit anxiety in pursuit of their anti-Tory agenda. These are the organisations which for decades have blocked every major reform of the education system and have defended every outdated working practice. With depressing inevitability, they have continually put their own narrow interests before the wider needs of pupils. They want the respect due to trained professionals but they frequently display the rebellious spirit of the permanent agitators. “Strike action is a very powerful tool,” said Amanda Martin, the President of the ,-strong National Education Unionin an interview with the Communist Morning Star newspaper in , adding, “I’ve run demos and rallies and worked with trade councils to bring everyone out and that’s brilliant.”Led by the NEU, the unions have brought the same attitude to the Coronavirus crisis. Instead of looking for solutions, they have endlessly exaggerated problems. One Whitehall insider says of Dr Mary Bousted, the £,-a-year joint general secretary of the NEU, “it’s all about the union, to hell with the teachers who want to get back into the classroom – let alone the children.” A left-wing radical, Bousted jokes that the word “strike” was one of the first she learnt as a child. Hers is not the voice of co-operation and enterprise, so it is hardly surprising that the Government has struggled to get schools reopened.In June, a planned majorwas thwarted by the unions, dealing a severe blow to Gavin Williamson’s credibility. One left-wing website gushed that the continued shutdown was due “to the hard work of NEU branch secretaries and rank and file militants galvanising the members.” In the months since, an alliance of unions – including Bousted’s NEU and Unite led by the notorious Merseyside militant Len McCluskey – have fought a y battle against a swt re-opening. Central to this effort at sabotage was a vast -point checklist of detailed questions which the Department for Education was told it had to answer. Dubbed by critics “a wreckers’ charter”, the list included queries such as “will lidded bins with double bagging be available in every classroom”, “will dedicated space be available for any breastfeeding women to express milk” and “has behaviour policy been reviewed to acknowledge the increased level of trauma and anxiety experienced by pupils ” Some Tories complained that the union was playing politics. Robert Halfon, the chairman of the Education Select Committee was amazed at the warped priorities: “It is incredible that not one of these nit-picking questions asks the most important thing of all – what’s best for the kids ”Even as September approaches, the whining and resistance has not ceased. “The unions need to stand firm and protect their members,” argues socialist teacher Martin Powell-Davies. In the latest ruse, the public sector outfit UNISON not only wants its members to wear masks in the classroom – something for which there is no scientic evidence of any need – but also to have extra funding for deep cleaning. “Schools need more money to pay for specially trained cleaners, rather than relying on other staff who are busy enough already,” says Jon Richards, UNISON’s head of education. The moan about over-stretched budgets is a favourite of the union movement but it is an empty accusation. The Government is pouring an extra £. billion into education, while this summer it was announced that teachers’ pay is to go up by an average of . per cent, a bigger increase than any other public sector workers received.But that did nothing to stop the combination of whingeing and shroud-waving. The mentality of the hardliners was embodied in a recent statement from the NEU’s far left “Education Solidarity Network” which set out a series of demands to “make sure safety comes first.” Among them were: “smaller class sizes to allow adequate physical distancing” arrangements “for rotas and home learning to be produced in consultation with parents” “local risk assessments to include staggered outdoor breaks, sanitising, provision of transparent coverings to enable access to lip reading and facial expression” and “weekly onsite testing of staff”. Above all, the Network called for extra funding “to implement these measures.” If there were any question of a risk to safety, the union should “prepare for a national strike ballot.”That was so typical. This lot seem to feel more comfortable on the picket line than in the classroom. The Solidary Network might be seen as extreme, but its carping outlook runs right through the unionYesterday, the NEU’s joint general secretary was bleating on the airwaves about the risks of new Covid spikes: “Staff, parents and pupils are being sorely let down by the government because of a lack of a Plan B and of ensuring robust track and trace is in place throughout the country. We believe the Government is negligent in the extreme.” The charge of negligence might be applied with more force to the NEU, whose hostile stance has made thesuch an exhausting obstacle course.

No, they said, you have to buy the item, take it home to try it on, then bring it backit doesn’t fit.

Because I need to protect myself, obviously. But I also have my med kit.The reporter said that a business they stood near had been lit on fire the previous night as riots raged.Facebook has now said it is investigating a ,-member group called Kenosha Guard, which reportedly promoted an event encouraging armed civilians to take to the streets to defend the city on TuesdayThe Milmaukee Journal Sentinel noted that based on Wisconsin law, Rittenhouse is being charged as an adult.The shooting reportedly began just after midnight as a group of protesters faced off police in riot trucks on Sheridan Road.The lead up isnt clear, but police think the first shooting may have resulted from a gas station conflict.Cops said self-styled militias were defending local businesses from looters.Witness Koerri Elijah told Insider that the person who carried out the shooting appeared to be on edge beforehand.I noticed him the entire time. He didnt seem like he was there with anyone, Elijah said.He was armed. He didnt seem like he was a threat, but I thought maybe I should keep an eye on him.Devin Scott, , told the Chicago Tribune he was in a group chanting Black Lives Matter when the gunfire began and that he tried unsuccessfully to revive one of the victims.This guy with this huge gun runs by us in the middle of the street and people are yelling, He shot someone! He shot someone! he said.And everyone is trying to fight the guy, chasing him, and then he started shooting again.Scott said he hit the ground during the next burst of gunfire, then tried to aid a person who was lying prone in the street.He added: I was cradling him in my arms. I was trying to keep this kid alive and he wasnt moving or nothing. He was just laying there.Carol Badoni, , from Burlington, Wisonsin, spoke to the girlfriend of one of the victims.“He definitely was not breathing,” she said.“His eyes were rolled back in his head. There was no pulse.”But she added that she saw no blood, before cops arrived and took the man to hospital.In another clip, a man was seen removing his top to help another victim of the shooting.People on the streets were also seen dragging the injured to the side of the road and performing CPR.A protester who had reportedly been shot in the head was loaded into the back of an SUV and rushed to a nearby hospital.Hours before Rittenhouse was identied as a suspect, social media sleuths named him and posted his picture online.https:twitter ShelbyTalcott status https:twitter ShelbyTalcott status Speaking about the unrest, Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul said: The violence and destruction that took place in Kenosha last night was despicable.While the two people who were killed and the person who was injured by gunfire have not yet been identied, we are thinking of their destroyed futures and their friends and families that must live with this overwhelming grief.Meanwhile, other protests erupted across the country in response to the Jacob Blake shooting.Police in Portland, Oregon, declared a gathering of hundreds of anti-racism protesters outside City Hall as a riot, ordering the crowd to disperse or face arrest.People at the Kenosha protest were heard shouting: Theres people getting shot everywhere.Kenosha has been riddled with violence, looting, criminal damage and fires since Blakes death on Sunday.Blake was shot as he stepped into his car after being unsuccessfully tasered and scuffling with officers attempting to arrest him in relation to a domestic violence dispute.Three of his sons were in the car at the time.On Tuesday, Blakes family confirmed that he is still alive but in a critical condition and is paralyzed.Jacob Blake Sr. said: They shot my son seven times. Seven times. Like he didnt matter. But my son matters. Hes a human being and he matters.While his family have pleaded for peaceful protests, they have hit out at police, saying they systematically brutalize black people.Police attempted to close off Kenosha after Monday nights protests led to buildings being set on fire and stores looted.Seven exit ramps were shut on Interstate- from the Illinois border to Racine, Wisconsin, which is about  minutes north of Kenosha.In downtown Kenosha, a huge crowd of protesters gathered around the barrier at Kenosha County Courthouse.One protester, Nathan, , who didnt want to give his full name said: A lot of fear in the air because of threats to protesters.“I worry a lot about the misinformation,” he said after explaining he didnt think national movement to bring greater police accountability will lead to real change.Although, he said locally, his city would never be the same.“It’s hard to see now, but it will be a positive thing,” he said of the protests.“It’ll bring Kenosha back together. Kenosha has always been a resilient place. It’ll continue to happen.”Thousands joined the protest on Tuesday, with some carrying handguns, AR- rles, knives and dressed in military flak jackets.Dennis, , from Racine, was carrying a pistol he claimed was for protection for himself and other protesters.“Nothing is going to change,” he said, hanging back from the crowd.“This is all for nothing.”One incident saw a group of the protesters violently shake a police barrier and launch fireworks at officers.Cops were seen firing tear gas pellets and rubber bullets into the crowd.One officer was heard shouting: Yall better have gas masks on!

It is ready, willing, and more than able. End problem FAST! he tweeted.On Monday, residents with firearms were seen standing outside local businesses in a bid to stop the looting and arson.One of the armed men in the footage taken Monday night says: Theyre destroying their own neighborhood.

Ultimately we aim to make a vaccine that will not only protect from Sars-CoV-, but other related coronaviruses that may spill over from animals to humans.”  He added that manufacturing of the vaccine should be cheap and said that it does not need to be refrigerated.This means that the vaccine will also be accessible to people in hotter countries.Prof Heeney said it’s unlikely that the new vaccine will trigger a bad immune response.The first trials will take place at the National Institute for Health Research Southampton Clinical Research Facility at University Hospital Southampton.Director of the facility, Professor Saul Faust said: “It is critical that dferent vaccine technologies are tested as at this stage no one can be sure which type of vaccine will produce the best and most long-lived immune responses.”It comes just days after Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty said he would be surpriseda vaccine was available before .The daily increase in fatalities and cases across the UK has continued to slow this month however health authorities are on high alert for any spike in the deadly bug.Prof Whitty today said he would be delighteda vaccine came early.But the CMO said: I’d be quite surprisedwe had a highly effective vaccine ready for mass use in a large percentage of the population before the end of winter, certainly before this side of Christmas.”He added: I think it is unlikely we will have a vaccine that is highly effective and ready to deploy at scale this winter meaning  .I think there is a reasonable chance that we will have vaccines, not a certainty, in the period before the following winter of  .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the policy proved controversial, leading to the worlds sixth highest per capita death rate - with care homes hit particularly badly.New research, reported by The Times, showed that levels of combined T-cell and antibody immunity could be more than  per cent. Dr Tegnell insists that this level of immunity makes it easier to control the outbreaks than when there is no immunity at all among the population.Scientists assumed, at the beginning of the pandemic, that around  per cent of people would need to be infected for the disease to fade away. But Henrique dos Santos Pereira, a scientist at the Federal University of Amazonas, said there was no “concrete explanation” for the mysterious drop in cases in Manaus.Brazil, meanwhile, has suffered one of the worst outbreaks in the world, with ,, cases and over , deaths. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I cannot remember any government being so devoid of direction, leadership, policy, conviction and — frankly — intelligence.And I had to endure Ted Heath AND John Major’s attempts to run the country. Oh, and the shaft of glorious sunshine that was Gordon Brown. Those guys have nothing on Boris. He is the clear leader in the field. If you ever wanted to know what a country would look likeit was led by Frank Spencer, here you go. Yes, I know — I’m showing my age. To be honest, under this administration I’m feeling my age.For those who don’t remember, Frank was a bumbling, dithering, halfwit from the s sitcom Some Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em. The only dference with Bojo is that Frank was thinner. And, mercully, a fictional creation. Boris is all too real. Many kids will be going back to school wearing face masks. For ages, this government insisted that they would not have to do so. Now they’ve changed their minds. Face masks and grouped in “bubbles”. Probably getting only about half of their usual education,that. Any kid who coughs will be pounced upon, exiled to the Outer Hebrides and the entire school shuts down. Never mind that there has been no recorded case of a schoolkid passing on the virus to a teacher.Never mind that our economy needs the schools fully open with a proper, normal, timetable, so people can get back to work.After six months of no lessons , the kids now have to endure insufferable conditions at school.This is because Boris and the rest have proved utterly incapable of standing up to the teaching unions .Other U-turns have involved the wearing of masks in shops, the usefulness of masks in general, whether there’s any point in closing our borders, the schools due to re-open in June, the scrapping of an expensive track and trace system, the re-grading of GCSEs and A levels . . . oh lordy, the list goes on and on.Sometimes the U-turn appears only a day after the original decision.Sometimes we have to wait a week or so. But come they surely do, a long parade of staggering ineptitude. In fact, I think even Frank Spencer would have been more decisive. Maybe the right comparison is with Benny from Crossroads. Yes, it’s my age again. For those who don’t know, Benny was a cast-iron moron.We know that dealing with this horrible pandemic can’t have been easy. We know Boris has had a dficult year.But the utter lack of planning and resolve has been astonishing. Slow to take the virus seriously, bizarrely refusing to close our airports at the peak of the outbreak, hopelessly lost over track and trace and what do with our poor kids.This has been mismanagement on an almost heroic level. My guess is that Boris will not survive as Prime Minister: His party will get shot of him when the opportunity arises. Because here’s the crucial, damaging question.Could Jeremy Corbyn have handled this crisis any worse I DON’T think those smug monkeys at the BBC realised the fury they would unleash when they banned singing our favourite anthems at The Last Night Of The Proms.A petition reached , names in just  hours.And Dame Vera Lynn is suddenly at No in the iTunes chart with Land Of Hope And Glory.The BBC apparently agreed with the Finnish conductor, Dalia Stasevska, that the “jingoistic” words of Land Of Hope And Glory and Rule Britannia would not be heard this year.I wonder what convinced Ms Stasevska to agree to conduct an evening of patriotic songs when she hates patriotic songs Money, you would guess. Meanwhile another BBC bureaucrat, Cat Lewis, likened singing the songs to Nazis singing about gas chambers.Silly woman. The BBC – its entire staff – has no understanding of the British people. It despises them. Support for the corporation is at an all-time low. And yet the BBC is still up to its tricks. Pulling off the unusual feat of being already in a coffin, but reaching out somehow to hammer more nails into its own lid.A TEAM of British scientists has been studying dreams and what they mean.And they’ve discovered they mean sod all. They are just a continuation of memories from the previous day.Other recent studies showed the same thing.

He has too much money. So much that he doesn’t know what to do with it.And as a result is completely insulated from the real world.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to get all of England’s pupils back to class full- time next week.The ex-schools supremos warned that No cannot fail in this test.Lord Baker,  — who was Education Secretary under Margaret Thatcher — said that the Covid education crisis could be as bad as the recession.He said: “This is the Prime Minister’s biggest challenge now, getting all children back to school.“You will find that some parents are anxious, and that some children won’t want to go back — but we have got to get them into the routine of schools.“Once you lose out on a stage of your schooling like this, you may end up losing out for ever.“It affects a child’s entire future. It is very, very important and it must happen.” Ms Greening, , who was Education Secretary under Theresa May, said the past six months have been “hugely damaging” for kids.She said: “Parents have done their level best home-schooling but we urgently need schools open safely so children can get back to full-time education. We also need a catch-up plan to help them recover lost ground.”Mr Hinds, , Education Secretary until July last year, said: “Kids desperately need to get back to school.“In the immediate term, mental and physical health are supported by the routine of going to school, interacting with friends and teachers and accessing purposeful activity.”Mr Laws, , Schools Minister during the Coalition, said: “Given the huge learning loss during lockdown, particularly for the poorest children, it’s vital we do everything we can to ensure a fullto school next week, provided this is supported by the health advice.”It is a crucial test for Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, who is clinging on to his job by a thread in the wake of humiliating U-turns on mask wearing in schools and A-level results.Fuming Tory MPs have urged No to sack himhe fails to get schools reopened on time.Perhaps an adult wearing a mask in a lab makes them safer but I believe children in a school will be less safe with masks. Do we really imagine a world where our teenagers turn up every day to school with a freshly washed mask which they will wear without issue throughout the day  They will swap their masks, ping them, lick them, spit in them and pass them around for fun. They will shout obscenities through them, bully each other over not having the right type, wear them wrong and they will encourage them to touch their faces dozens of times a day.And teachers need to be able to see the mouths of their charges to hold them to account for chatting, swearing and the like. Mask them up and teachers won’t have a clue who said it. Eventually you have chaos in the classroom. Hand-washing, social-distancing as much as one can and keeping children in bubbles is the way to go. Headteachers should not be swayed by how things appear and rather look seriously at how things really are.Schools in Wales are also reopening next week, while they have been open for a fortnight already in Scotland.All of the UK’s chief medical officers have declared that it is safe for children toto school.On a visit to a school in Leicestershire today, Mr Johnson said: “This is an absolutely invaluable time for them — they must get back into school.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I couldnt get the images out of my head.I felt awful when I realised my hair was smoking. I laughed, admittedly, because it was burning my scalp.I turned to my partner and said, its actually burning, like boiling burning. I put tinfoil on it because obviously in hairdressers they wrap it in foil. So I thought I was being clever by wrapping my hair in tinfoil.The tinfoil kept the heat in and it was boiling. Even to touch the tinfoil on the top of my head was like touching a kettle.I lted the tinfoil off and smoke came from my head, and he said you need to go [wash it off].We sat and giggled about it in disbelief really. He made the comparison once it was dry and you could see the ginger and that the ends were frazzled.Hollie sought advice from a hairdresser who warned her that her hair was probably delicate due to post-pregnancy hormones and suggested combining the bleach with conditioner instead.After two more attempts to bleach it across three days, the support worker finally got it to a colour where she could dye it blue as planned.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nicola hadnt worn cream due to the grey clouds while sitting on the top deck of her cruise ship, but the shins on both her legs burst into blistering burns.The -year-old claims the pain was the worst shes ever experienced - even though shes been through two hip replacements and childbirth.The new bride had left suncream in her bag in the cabin after heavy cloud cover and choppy winds cancelled the cruises exertions in the Bahamas, West Indies, for the day.Nicola and husband Stephen Law sat on the top deck chatting with pals without sun cream on - with the mum-of-ones celtic complexion leaving her vulnerable to sun damage.When Nicola woke up the following morning, she immediately collapsed after getting out of bed as shooting pains made her knees buckle and left her in the worst pain ever.Enormous blisters erupted over both her shins which were so big the outlines were visible through her jeans.The terried mum was forced to burst the blisters before walking through airport security for fear that security guards would pull her to one side to find out what she had in her trousers.The wounds produced so much liquid that Nicolas shoes were squelching and she was making puddles so had to buy sanitary pads to soak up the moisture during the six-hour flight.She was in so much agony she needed a wheelchair to get through Dublin airport once she landed.But the complacent mum still dismissed it as regular sunburn - until Stephen, , was urged by a pharmacist to take his we to AE immediately.Now Nicola is speaking out about her ordeal to warn others to take proper precautions in the sun - and to not underestimate sun damage through the clouds.Nicola, from Lisburn, Northern Ireland, said: Ive had two full hip replacements and given birth naturally, and the pain from this was  times worse than any of them. Ive never known pain like it. It was so intense.Ive been sunburned loads of times because I fry dead easily. Usually I do the aftersun and usual moaning and groaning and tell myself off for being stupid. But never has it been that bad.My husband had to help me stand up to go to the toilet or anything. Once I was moving I was okay but standing up when the pain went right up your leg, I buckled a few times because it was that bad.The blisters got so big that you could see the outline of them through my trousers.By this stage I just wanted to go home and I was afraid of the airport security either thinking I was hiding something or not letting me fly.I burst the blisters, which I found out afterwards was the worst thing I couldve done. The liquid that poured out of me, my shoes were squelching. I was leaving puddles when I was walking.I ended up going into a shop in the airport and buying a pack of sanitary towels and a pair of long socks and putting the sanitary towels inside the socks to catch the fluid from my legs.That flight was the longest, most intense flight of my le. It was terrible. We were cramped in one place and my legs were just throbbing.I had to be wheelchaired off the plane to the front of the airport to get my lt because by this point I couldnt physically walk.Doctors diagnosed Nicola with second-degree burns and even contemplated using skin grafts to repair the damage.But luckily, after four days in the burns unit and doctors cleaning and changing her wounds daily, she was allowed tohome on March   without surgical intervention.Nicola claims she has kept her legs covered up ever since and applies factor  sun cream as often as she can - but still feels guilty for ruining the end of her honeymoon.Nicola said: The consultant asked me how long I had been in the sun and he said he couldnt believe how much damage I had done in such a short space of time.He wouldve thought that I had fallen asleep in it or been out in it for hours. He said it was because I was on the top deck so I was closer to the sun.We were out at sea so we had the salty air and the breeze coming at you as well. He said thats actually worse than being in the glaring sun. I didnt know that at the time. I thought because it was cloudy [I would be fine].I knew once I was on the beach I would need the sunscreen, but because the weather was so bad and it was so cloudy and windy, I thought I dont need it yet so I will put it on later as it warms up.It was ignorance and stupidity on my part. I still feel guilty now because I feel like I ruined the last half of our honeymoon.My legs havent seen daylight since then, which was two and a half years ago. Ill never take that risk again. Even though theyve healed, in cold weather they will sting.Thats a good sign apparently as it means the nerves are still alive in my legs.GOT a story  EMAIL exclusive@the-sun Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He said: “I know those dolphins, I swim with dolphins every day. It’s heartbreaking seeing them like this. It’s like deaths in the family.”Other dolphins stranded on shore appeared seriously ill, environmental consultant Sunil Dowarkasing said.Mr Dowarkasing saidL This is a terrible day. We are seeing these dolphins swim up to the shore in distress and then die, said Dowarkasing, a former member of parliament. We have never seen deaths of these very intelligent marine mammals like this. Never. More dolphins may have died out at sea and tests will be done to determine the cause of death of those found on shore.Dowarkasing theorised the creatures were either killed by the toxic oil seepage or chemicals in the bow of the sunken ship, which polluted Mauritius pristine waters.The Japanese bulk carrier MV Wakashio ran aground on a coral reef near the eastern coast of Mauritius on July . Pounded by the surf for days, the ships hull cracked and on August  it began leaking fuel into the waters of the Mahebourg Lagoon, fouling a protected wetlands area, mangroves and a small island that was a bird and wildle sanctuary.The ship later broke in two and the bow, the smaller of the two pieces, was towed out to sea and sunk.The ships captain and first officer have been charged with endangering safe navigation. Its not yet clear why the ship strayed miles off course, with the environmental group Greenpeace calling for an investigation. This is a deeply sad and alarming day for the people ofMauritius and for its singular bioersity, said Happy Khambule, Greenpeace Africas senior climate and energy campaign manager.The long-term impacts of the oil spill will likely affect whales, turtles, seabirds and much of the marine le in the area, Greenpeacewarned.Results from an autopsy conducted on of the dolphins found on Wednesday are expected later today. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This shouldnapost be necessary to say, because we all had history lessons and we were awake for some of them. But Britannia has never ruled the waves.We had officially-approved pirates who stole gold from the Spanish and started the slave trade. We had glorious navies that had a habit of sinking, we dodged U-boats, we provided the first circumnavigation of the globe, and the first man to do it alone. But we also had a king who told the waves to go away, and collective amnesia about the point he was trying to make.King Cnut did not get his feet wet in the th century just so he could be a cipher for a swearword on Twitter , years later. He tried to rule the waves in order to prove that, despite being a warrior king with  North Sea countries beneath his heel, waves do their own thing. Britannia was around before him, was revived as a bit of Elizabethan militarist propaganda, and in  got nicked by a prince who wanted a song to impress his dad, George II. At the time, our ruling of the waves was centred on what became known as the War of Jenkinsapos Ear, about slave trading rights. We lost. The Prime Minister, who likes to give the impression he knows more history than anyone , must know that Rule Britannia is a silly song. He must, surely, realise that these islands did not pop up from an azure main, has noangels, and especially that not only has it got one of the smallest navies of all time, but is about to have a cavalry without any tanks.He probably does think, as verse  does, that foreign nations must, in their turn, to tyrants fall, that we are the envy of them all and our cities shall with commerce shine as verse  proclaims. But itaposs bollocks. Mainly because anything you tell George II in  to keep him happy is bound to be, but also because Boris Johnson has put this country on a course to - let me just check this official government document - ah yes, complete economic and social meltdown. That is no reason for the PM not to make a fuss about the BBC being too wet to let us sing a jaunty tune. Because otherwise we might notice that Dominic Cummings has given £m in uncontested government contracts to his mates, that a misogynist Aussie with no business experience has been put in charge of our Brexit trade deals, and that heaposs u-turned so often the PM is technically doing doughnuts in Downing Street. Of all the things that should be making anyone, of any political bent or age or race, steaming mad today, the fact that an empty Albert Hall will not be shaken to the rafters by , people who only know the chorus anyway is the very least of them.Get angry about Cummings gting a total of £m in contracts to colleagues and friends to find out what the public think of the government, when he could ask his neighbours for free.Fret, why donapost you, about how a shadowy group of Right-wing conspiracy theorists who claim to be protecting children marched on Buckingham Palace to shout paedophile! at Prince Andrew, despite the fact not a single Royal was in residence and the crimes he is accused of, while heinous, do not include paedophilia. Such stupidity is expected, by Brits, in other countries - itaposs pretty worrying to see it manest in The Mall.Or you could be infuriated by shame at the country being run by people who genuinely believe the Board of Trade should be graced by a man of without business experience, but who sent refugee children to sicken and starve on a Pacic island and whose reputation, such as it is, was savaged in the most devastating political speech Australia has ever witnessed.  Second thoughts, letaposs not. Merely boiling with fury does not seem to change much. If it did, Piers Morgan would be God.Letaposs ask ourselves, instead, whether to mask, or not to mask that is the question. Whether apostis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of these absolute cockwhistles, or to take arms against a sea of troublesome twits, and by opposing, end them.Letaposs remind ourselves that weaposre arguing about masks only because incompetents who have spent decades arguing about bendy bananas and how many children theyaposre responsible for are now in charge of keeping us safe, and are arguing about that, too. The question to ask is whether you put up with all this, or arm yourself with the knowledge and facts they would rather you didnapost have. Like the background to Rule Britannia, the lyrics you never knew, and wondering how it is that this country has forgotten it started, and ended, slavery fought just, and unjust, wars honoured, and destroyed, countless wrongaposuns. History will tell you that Britain is not all bad, and not all good. Richard the Lionheart was a magnicent warrior, and brutal Islamophobe and anti-Semite. Elizabeth I was feted as a great beauty, and ended her days a crone with blackened teeth. Queen Victoria was thick as mince, Bazalgetteaposs sewer and WT Steadaposs th century sensationalist journalism did more to improve public health than any -word slogans, and our last  Prime Ministers have been an ever-decreasing circle of ineptitude who have deprived this nation of everything it still had that was great. Common sense went out the window with austerity. Historical perspective, the ability to see the past and future and our place in it, was pissed up the wall in the Brexit referendum.

The scheme comes after warnings people who should self-isolate may notit meant they were unable to work and would lose pay. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: “The British public have already sacriced a great deal to help slow the spread of the virus. “Self-isolatingyou have tested positive for Covid-, or have come into contact with someone who has, remains vital to keeping on top of local outbreaks. “This new payment scheme will help people on low incomes and who are unable to work from home to continue playing their part in the national fight against this virus.” "},{"url":null,"title":"masks schools new rules children","story":"NewsMasks in schools - the new rules on where and when children need to wear face coveringsAfter another spectacular U-turn, the government has decided that some children can and should wear masks and face coverings in school.

Ministers had insisted there would be no recommendation for children to wear face coverings in communal areas, and said the scientic evidence backed them up. But late last night, after the Scottish Government had issued obligatory guidance that pupils should wear face coverings when moving around schools from Monday, the Department for Education issued a change in advice. But what are the new rules  When and where will children have to wear masks - and will it apply to all schools  Hereaposs everything you need to know about the new changes. What measures are being introduced in England  From September , and in secondary schools in England that are within areas under local restrictions, face coverings should be worn when moving around corridors and communal spaces. This does not include classrooms and does not apply to primary-aged pupils. Why are face coverings not required in classrooms   Guidance from the Department for Educationsays that it will not usually be necessary in classrooms, as protective measures mean the risks are lower - such as grouping staff and students in bubbles. Face coverings can have a negative impact on learning and teaching and so their use in lessons should be avoided, it adds.So in which areas should face coverings be worn in secondary schools  Additional precautionary measures apply to places defined as areas of national Government intervention, as listed on the gov.uk website, according to the guidance. Local restrictions are currently in place in areas of Greater Manchester, Lancashire, and West Yorkshire, Leicester, Luton and Northampton. Can schools recommend face coveringsthey are where in England  Schools and colleges outside of local lockdown areas will have the discretion to require face coverings in communal areas where social distancing cannot be safely managed, the guidance says. It gives the example of a school or college which has a layout that makes it particularly dficult for people to stay apart. Are there any exemptions  Yes. Those who cannot put on, wear or remove a face covering because of a physical or mental illness or impairment, or disability, will be exempt. Guidance says that exemptions also apply to people who provide assistance to someone who relies on lip-reading, clear sound or facial expression to communicate. Could the measures be changed further  Education Secretary Gavin Williamson ruled out the requirements for face coverings in Englandaposs schools being extended further. When askedthe measures could be extended, he told the BBC: No, no, thereaposs no intention of extending it beyond that because as bothsaid andsaid is that actually that isnapost what is required. What has the Scottish Government announced on face coverings  Face coverings should be worn by staff and pupils when moving around secondary schools in Scotland from August , according to Holyroodaposs Education Secretary. John Swinney said that the rule will apply on school transport for primary school pupils aged five and above, and all those at secondary school in communal areas, but not in classrooms.

About , more people moved to the UK than left the UK up to March , according to the Office of National Statistics. That is up from , when the last data were published in May - and takes net migration to the highest level since march , when it was an estimated ,. Publication of that figure came at the height of the Brexit referendum campaign and was seized on by anti-EU activists as evidence that Britain had “lost control of its borders” because the UK was unable to stop EU nationals coming because of freedom of movement rules. The latest figures show , people moved to the UK compared with about , who left. The increase in immigration and net migration was fuelled by an increase in Chinese and Indian students coming to study in the UK, analysts said. Of those arriving in Britain, , came for formal study, with , arriving for work, family or other reasons. Jay Lindop, director of the ONSaposs Centre for International Migration, said: “Our best estimate of net migration, using all available data sources, is , for the year ending March . After a period of stability, we were seeing migration levels begin to increase in the past  months leading up to the coronavirus pandemic. This was being driven by increases in non-EU student arrivals, mainly from China and India.  The IPS data were collected up to March  and do not take into account the signicant impact the pandemic has had on international migration since then. Migration Watch UK chairman Alp Mehmet said: The latest net migration figures from the ONS are shocking,not surprising. “The record level of net non-EU migration is an indication of the scale of the problem and what the Government needs to control and reduce. “The proposed points-based system will do nothing of the sortanything, the inflow of migrants from around the world will increase.

The vast majority are in the south and Midlands, figures from Public Health England reveal - following warnings that virus hotspots were moving south. Redditch, in Worcestershire, has seen its rate treble in the seven days to Sunday. Kettering, in Northamptonshire, also experienced a sharp rise, with the number of new infections nearly doubling in a week, while the current rate in Mid Devon is ten times higher than it was the previous week. Oxford, where  infections were confirmed, has seen its rate rocket from . cases per , to . - prompting warnings of lockdown measures. In a statement to people living in the city, Ansaf Azhar, Oxfordshire County Council’s director for public health, said: Do we really want to end up with the kind of local control measures we have seen introduced in ious parts of Lancashire, Yorkshire, Leicester and Aberdeen  “At the minute it feels like we are moving in that direction.

Councillor Sara Rowbotham, cabinet member for health and wellbeing at Rochdale Borough Council, said: Increasing numbers of people who are testing positive for coronavirus have no symptoms so we encourage everyone to get tested.We need to identy who has the virus so we can stop it spreading. Latest data shows a sharp fall in hotspots including Leicester, Northampton, Oldham, Blackburn and Pendle.But the government has been accused of being confused and bungled in its lockdown messaging by council leaders in West Yorkshire. The leaders of Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees have joined their counterparts in Greater Manchester in criticising proposals to tackle the virus on a ward-by-ward basis. Another announcement on restrictions in parts of Greater Manchester, east Lancashire and West Yorkshire is due to be made on Friday after Thursdayaposs meeting of the Joint Biosecurity Centrechaired by Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Englandaposs chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty. Last week, Mr Hancock announced a more targeted approach to Covid- restrictions in which the views of MPs would also be sought to gain the maximum possible local consensus.  He added this would allow local councils to focus resources on the wards which need more targeted intervention in order to drive infection rates down. In a statement, councillors Susan Hinchclfe, Tim Swt and Shabir Pandor, the leaders of Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees respectively, said: Our infection rates have come down signicantly this week, although they are still high. Over the last few months and weeks we, as leaders, have taken dficult decisions and directed signicant resource in our councils to make this happen. However, throughout this time Government messaging has been confused and bungled.  The latest sht in Government messaging that happened last week was that they inferred they wanted to see more localised restrictions, ying them ward by ward rather than by local authority areas. To add to the confusion, Government want to review and change these place by place weekly, leading to inconsistency in restrictions across the North. In the latest guidance from Government there is a presumption that wards with a low number of cases will start to revert to the national restrictions this week.

The house, belonging to -year-old Paul, had to be cleaned by specialists after piles of rubbish and mountains of collections reached the ceiling. His bathroom and kitchen had been completely unusable for years but Paul said he got around this by eating outside, going to cafes and going where to have a shower. Paul and his mother bought the three bedroom house in Crosby, Merseyside,  years ago, after his father died, for £,. On Channel  documentary Hoarders, which airs on Thursday night, he said: We had a nice modern kitchen, nice garden as well, it was a very attractive house.  But hoarding is often triggered by traumatic le events and the problems in Paulaposs home began after the said death of his mum, Liverpool Echo reports.He said: Four and a half years after my mother died, in , thataposs when I started collecting. I think in the back of my mind, I thought aposthat will look nice in the houseapos a bit like what my mother had. And then it began to overwhelm me over time and got too much. The books are the first thing that started to pile up and Iaposve got a couple thousands books now. During the programme, George Mensah of Merseyside House Clearance was called in to clear Paulaposs home.  Unable to even enter the property, George was forced to climb over the mounds of belongings that Paul had accumulated and even used a special camera to be able to see further into the home. During his survey, the master cleaner found rats that had become trapped in the house and then died, being left to rot and stfen amongst the rubbish. Some of the most commonly hoarded items, such as papers, books and clothing, were all found in the rooms of the house as George made his way through. This had filled up every room in Paulaposs house, including the hallway, but some other items that Paul had collected were slightly more unusual. Roman artefacts, weapons and armour were also discovered during the clear out. One bedroom was the only area of the house that George could properly access. Paul hoped that cleaners could sht his hoard for him and he would be able to sell the home, which lies on a quiet street in Sefton, to fund his retirement. During the clean up process, Paul found it dficult to let some of his items go and could be heard telling Georgeaposs colleagues not to throw books away and saying he wanted to keep a part of the Roman wall in York.  After some of the hoard was cleared, Paul was informed that due to the damage he had caused to his home by the hoarding, it would only be worth £, on the market. It took eight skips and nine days in total to clear Paulaposs house before potential buyers were able to come and view the property. Hoarding disorder is the mental health problem that has led people to leave their homes in filthy conditions, piled high with rubbish and has even led to a number of court cases over the years. The Royal College of Psychiatrists and the NHS have signicant information about hoarding disorder and what it can mean for people day-to-day but also explains that hoarding can lead to signicant problems, such as those above. Here are some of the most common questions about hoarding disorder, what it means, and how to stop it getting out of control. What is hoarding disorder  Hoarding disorder is where someone acquires an excessive number of items and stores them in a chaotic manner. This usually results in unmanageable amounts of clutter and in some cases hoarding in your home. Most common items that people hoard Some people with a hoarding disorder will hoard a range of items, while others may just hoard certain types of objects. Items that are often hoarded include newspapers and magazines, books, clothes, receipts and household supplies. Some people also hoard animals, which they may not be able to look after properly. More recently, hoarding of data has become more common. This is where someone stores huge amounts of electronic data and emails that theyaposre extremely reluctant to delete. Why do people hoard  The reasons why someone begins hoarding are not fully understood but it can often be a symptom of another condition. Mental health problems associated with hoarding include severe depression, psychotic disorders and obsessive compulsive disorder. In some cases, hoarding is a condition in itself and often associated with self-neglect. These people are more likely to live alone, be unmarried, have had a deprived childhood or have a family history of hoarding. How can hoarders be treated  Hoarding disorders are challenging to treat because many people who hoard frequently do not see it as a problem, or have little awareness of how itaposs affecting their le or the lives of others. Many do realise they have a problem but are reluctant to seek help because they feel extremely ashamed, humiliated or guilty about it. Itaposs really important to encourage a person who is hoarding to seek help, as their dficulties discarding objects can not only cause loneliness and mental health problems but also pose a health and safety risk. Hoarding makes it dficult for a person to move around their home, and it can also cause their work performance, personal hygiene and relationships to suffer as it takes over their le. So much clutter in a home can be dangerous and unhygienic. It can lead to rodent or insect infestations, be a fire risk and block exits in the event of an emergency, cause trips and falls, or even collapse on peoplekept in tall piles. To help a person with a suspected hoarding disorder, try to persuade them to go with you to see a GP, the NHS says. It adds: This may not be easy, as someone who hoards might not think they need help. Try to be sensitive about the issue and emphasise your concerns for their health and wellbeing. Reassure them that nobody is going to go into their home and throw everything out. Youaposre just going to have a chat with the doctor about their hoarding to see what can be done and what support is available to empower them to begin the process of decluttering. The main treatment is cognitive behavioural therapywith a therapist who will help the person to understand why they are unable to bin things and allow clutter to build up. Antidepressant medicines called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have also been shown to help some people with hoarding disorders, the NHS says."},{"url":null,"title":"lucky dad wins lottery after","story":"AdvertorialLucky dad wins Lottery after le-saving operation - and his reaction is brilliantThrilled Graham was overjoyed to scoop a share of £, playing Peoples Postcode LotteryShareByDave Masters:,  AUG AdvertorialThrilled Graham Forrester has gone from le-saving surgery to a le-changing fortune after winning a share of £, on People’s Postcode Lottery.

There have been many claims that she and Prince Harry struggled with their position in The Firm, which saw them come after Prince Charles, Camilla and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge when it came to events, publicity and cash.During a chat with US rights activist Gloria Steinem about female representation in politics ahead of the US election, she was told about about historical leadership in America.Speaking to media  MAKERS Women, Gloria said: In fact, on the land where we are, before Europeans showed up, there were Native American cultures in which women were equal, in which grandmothers chose the Chief.It was a system of balance and our Constitution is based on that, which we should remember. And it was about a circular idea of consensus, circles of consensus going up rather than hierarchy, which is the source of the linked not ranked. They then reference a bracelet Gloria gave Meghan which has the motto aposLinked not rankedapos. Meghan says I love this, before Gloria continues: Well, you know actually, ‘we are linked not ranked’ is the shortest way I’ve ever found to say what our goal is.  Speaking about her personal views, Meghan says: It means everything to me on every level we are linked not ranked. Gloria adds: And I thank you for understanding that rank is less important than being linked. That’s a big thing. As the younger son of Prince Charles and Diana, Harry is less senior than William and itaposs unlikely he will ever be king - something heaposs always said he was very happy about. However after the births of George, Charlotte and Louis, Harry is now sixth in line to the throne which means his charity work and duties always come after his older brother and dad. According to a new book about Meghan and Harry, Finding Freedom, the coupleaposs lower ranking caused upset being Palace walls. The book claims they often took a back seat to other family members. Authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand write: While they both respected the hierarchy of the institution, it was dficult when they wanted to focus on a project and were told that a more senior ranking family member, be it Prince William or Prince Charles, had an initiative or tour being announced at the same time – so they would just have to wait.  They also claim that the funding element of the hierarchy caused a lot of tension between the brothers. A source told the authors: Where you are born in this family dictates your position of power, and because of that, Harry has always come second to his brother, especially when it comes to funding. There were times in the past that Harry wanted to take on bigger projects and do more work, but he couldnapost get the money to support it. William was always the priority. A lot of quarrels have been over budgets. In the interview with Gloria Steinem, Meghan also gushed about Prince Harry being a feminist and a aposbeautulapos role model for their son Archie.

Kenyon claimed the tribute at Regina Court in Salford, Greater Manchester was a health and safety hazard and was said to have uprooted the ft high tree, killed off the grass and plants with weedkiller and even damaged the ornaments which included commemorative dolls. He was also accused of writing poison pen notes claiming Mrs Ilkovics had a bogus husband and that she had only married him for his money and suggested she was involved in shoplting.Kenyon would rant and rave at her from behind a window at his flat and unnecessarily summoning ambulances to Mrs Ilkovicsapos home wrongly claiming she had a severe mental illness and needed taking away. During one incident Kenyon dumped some of the ornaments in a shoebox on Mrs Ilkovicaposs wheelie bin whilst she was away on holiday with an acerbic note saying: Please find enclosed the funeral ornaments you placed without permission.Said items Iaposm reliably informed are supposed to be placed indoors either side of an urn for example. Whilst one appreciates certain iniduals placing such items and all manner of other rubbish on graves, It is not acceptable in a domestic garden.You have caused not only an affront to my religious beliefs but blocked access to the fire escape and wasted police time.  Another note he put in his window referred to Mrs Ilkovicaposs home saying: Goods available strictly CODconvicted shoplter. At Manchester magistrates court this week the so-called Battle of Regina Court came to a climax with Kenyon being convicted of harassment between September  and February . He was cleared of assaulting Mrs Ilkovics by throwing a dog toy at her. He denied any wrongdoing. The court heard Mrs Ilkovics had married her husband in June  as he lay terminally ill in hospital and he died the following month.  But she fell out with Kenyon when set up the shrine outside their respective homes in the apartment complex which houses the elderly or those with disabilities. Mrs Ilkovics told JPs: Before Rick got ill we planted a little pussy willow in  and after his death I put a few things that were a tribute to him - plastic hearts, flowers and such like. The little heart had apossadly missedapos on it and there was a little angel and a little heart with flowers that my friend gave me to put there. It was something to put there in honour of my late husband - it wasnapost a great big tribute it was just three little ornaments.  When Mr Kenyon originally moved into his flat I had personally asked him does he mindI worked on the garden and put things in it and his answer was: aposyou can do anything you want with it - Iaposm not into gardening.apos I like a nice garden it is therapeutic for me. But the first thing was I received was note in the box I had made which was saying I only married Rick for his money and that he was a aposbogusapos husband. My sister had invited me over to Portugal for a week but when It got back, a neighbour was at the door waiting for me she said: aposthey are on the bin and I saw a note about the ornaments. I felt very upset as it was about my husband and my husband was my le. What Mr Kenyon was saying about the ornaments was horrible. How can an ornament cause a fire hazard  I reported it to the housing association but I received three more notes saying hateful and nasty things about me having second and third hand stuff in the garden - that I was this, that and the other.  One was pinned to the dolls outside my front door. I had bought some slates as I thought the turf was dying but it was due to weed killer. I had seen him spraying weed killer on the garden on a number of occasions - why should he use weed killer on the garden knowing it would kill my plants that I took pride in  It has affected me a lot. I have depression and anxiety and at one stage I wanted to kill myself. I couldnapost live with the pain of what he was doing to what once was mine and my husbandaposs pride and joy. It hurt a lot losing my husband and it still hurts now. It then really hurts when I look at what this man has done outside my front door. He could have knocked on my door instead of ripping them up and putting them in a black shoe box on top of my bin.  Itaposs disgusting and horrible to have to live with. I lie awake all night thinking he is going to do something and most of the time Iaposm right. He went berserk on everything and he couldnapost have a conversation with you. He would just shout things like aposcan you get rid of those things apos I was told to remove the dolls from the front door they said it was blocking a fire exit. They had been screwed down but they got broken into pieces by Mr Kenyon. There was one left near my bin shed with all horrible stuff tipped on it. On one occasion my friendaposs daughter paid for me to go to Costa Del Sol to get a break. I had not long been back home when I got a knock on my door at am and there was loads of banging outside.  I knew it would be something to do with Anthony Kenyon. I soon found everything smashed up and pulled up again - the trellis with the roses, the rose bush, the trellis around the garden. The fencing all smashed up. The pussy willow had been twisted asit had tried to drag it out and I nearly fainted. I was anxious and upset because that was the last thing that I could remember my husband by. Mr Kenyon was was talking through the window, ranting and raving about my roses on the ground being at his doorstep and using terrible language. I donapost know what he was talking about. He was mentioning Rickaposs name all the time and calling him names. He didnapost even know Rick who was a wonderful man. I have become a hermit in my own home I donapost feel asmy own home is my home anymore. But I wonapost leave as it has got my memories of my husband.

In fact, the Cambridge family have two stunning royal properties - one in London and another in Norfolk. Their main base is Apartment A of Kensington Palace, near Prince George and Princess Charlotteaposs school, which boasts  rooms, including five reception rooms, three master bedrooms and two nurseries. It also has two kitchens, which earned the Duchess the nickname two-kitchens Kate after the couple spent £.million of taxpayersapos money refurbishing the property when they moved in. Speaking about the Cambridge family home on True Royaltyaposs Royal Beat, royal author Christopher Warwick said: It has  rooms from the basement to the attic, it is not a small house. All of these royal residences at Kensington Palace are called apartments, which of course makes people immediately think they are flats like the American term for an apartment. They are not. If you think of Kensington Place in a way it is built around three courtyards. If you kind of think of them as being these wonderful red brick terrace houses. Because they are all joined, but separate houses. Royal editor Ingrid Seward added: Itaposs enormous - and itaposs like a piece of countryside in London.  The Cambridges arenapost the only royals to live at the palace, and Princess Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank, Prince Richard, the Queenaposs cousin and his we and the Prince and Princess of Kent also call it home. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry also used to live there, in Nottingham Cottage, before moving to Windsor, and then Canada and LA.While parts of Kensington Palace are open to the public, the familyaposs private living area isnapost - and they are given completely privacy there. However Kate and William occasionally use it as a base when hosting guests - which means weaposve have a sneak peek inside some of the more formal parts. When Barack and Michelle Obama visited the UK back in , Kate and William invited them into their apartment for dinner. Later that year the Duchess set up a aposnews roomapos in the Palace to use on the day she guest edited the Huffington Post UK for a day as part of the Young Minds Matter initiative.During the coronavirus pandemic, the couple have been working from home like everyone  - and theyaposve shown us some snaps of their offices.Kate has a line of Penguinaposs Clothbook Classics, novels released in hardback with beautully illustrated covers. Her collection includes Jane Austinaposs Manfield Park and Northanger Abbey and George Elliottaposs Middlemarch. Buying all the books separately would set you back £, but theyaposre currently on offer for £ for all . Kateaposs wooden chair has a creamed stripped cushion. In the background there is a white sofa, and what looks like a childrenaposs armchair which may belong to George, Charlotte and Louis. William also shared a snap of his home set up, which appears to be in a dferent room, with a traditional wooden desk in front of a large fireplace.

Most of the new neighbours on the Maples estate in Holton-le-Clay, Lincolnshire moved in two years ago. Now developers, Snape Properties Limited are getting the road ready for Lincolnshire County Council to adopt and maintain them, including the installation of a two metre path along the road.The homeowners were shocked at the discovery that their land is going to be built over as their gardens and driveways currently go right up to the kerb, reports GrimsbyLive. Robert Stafford, , is one of the residents, who co-owns his property with Lincolnshire Housing Partnership . He said: None of us knew about this. LHP are saying this was in the plans the entire time, but when I was sold the house we were sold it as a two car driveway and a large front garden. The plans that we were shown were also very unclear, it looked like a photocopy of a photocopy, and there was no distinct area between our house and the road. We are all angry because we werenapost told about this when we bought the house. If it was already in place or we were informed from the start that paths would be installed, then fair enough, but we feel like we were mis-sold the house. There was little to no notice about the gardens being torn up, either. We received a letter a few months back saying the roads were going to be made ready for the council to adopt them, but they didnapost say anything about the paths being installed. This has had a big impact on the residents that live there, who have seen their front gardens dug up while they have been out at work. Robert said: A nurse that lives several doors down was almost in tears because she came back from work and found her front garden a mess because they had dug it up. Itaposs upset a lot of people here. My partner stopped them from digging up the land the other day, but it has been marked and we are losing about half of our front garden. Some people own part of their house with LHP, while others own theirs outright, and those that own their house outright are really upset. Iaposve lived here for  months and we are only just finding out about it now.  We got an email from LHP saying itaposs the buildersapos fault for putting down grass right to the road, but they should have told us that we were going to lose that land because of the path either way. Some have it worse than others, some houses have lost most of their front garden, while others have lost grass down the side of the house, which doesnapost make as big a dference. But itaposs been handled really badly. Many of us are incredibly upset at how this has been handled. In the email sent to Robert, LHP said: Typically, this area would be edged and hardcored to clearly distinguish it from your front garden area, however it looks as though the builder has continued to turf up to the edge of the road and this has caused the confusion. With the legal conveyance documentation being correct and neither LHP or yourselves highlighting the dference on the ground through purchase process I appreciate you are now in the position where you feel you have purchased less than you originally thought.

In November last year, the -year-old took a break from work but never ed, instead flying to Frankfurt before jetting off to Japan, where he hanged himself in a hotel room, a coroner was told. Born in Denmark, Adeel moved to the UK with his family in , settling in Slough, Berks., and taking a job at Royal Mailaposs Heathrow Worldwide Distribution Centre, sorting international mail. The inquest heard that the young man was engaged to a distant relative from Pakistan as part of an arranged marriage that was due to take place in February this year.  However, in messages to his brother Umar, he explained the prospect of marriage both excited and depressed him. Later in an email, Adeel wrote: By the time you have read this, I will be dead. I did not leave because of the marriage, I left because I do not want the le I have. I work my arse off and have no rewards. I have been dealt one bad card after another, I do not want to keep playing. If I meet Allah, I will tell him to cut you guys some slack. Having not ed to work on November , , his family was informed and immediately reported him as a missing person. Following police inquiries, it appeared Adeel had flown from Heathrow Airport to Frankfurt. Concerned for his welfare, officers emailed Adeel asking for his whereabouts and on December , they received a mysterious response. Adeel wrote: I have been reported missing. I am not missing, I left home on my own and I am perfectly fine. I do not want to contact my family and I would appreciate ityou would not either. Two days later, Adeelaposs brothers logged into his NatWest banking account and discovered he had made two ATM withdrawals in the same location, so the desperate men flew out to Germany to seethey could find him.  However, their efforts were too late as Adeel was already on his way to Japan - a sentimental destination he had visited twice before. In communications with his distressed brother Umar, Adeel discussed matters which troubled him. He felt he was suffering without having a degree, he was about to run out of money and the prospect of marriage both excited and depressed him, the assistant Berkshire coroner heard. On December , , Adeelaposs devastated family received the email. The Adeelaposs body was found in his room in the Net Room Manboo Hotel in Shinjuku City, Tokyo. His brothers travelled to Japan to recover his property and the young manaposs body was repatriated to the UK.

The Met Office warned: Heavy showers and thunderstorms are expected to develop quite quickly later on Friday morning, but peaking during the afternoon for many, before probably becoming more restricted to the south-east and south coastal counties towards evening.Some places will miss the heavier rain, but other locations could see around mm within an hour and perhaps  to mm in around three hours, sufficient to cause issues on the roads. By Friday night onwards, many places will struggle to get temperatures that are in the double digits, said Ms Diamond.  A spokesperson for the Met Office said: Itaposs staying unsettled this week with further showers and heavy rain in places, before turning more settled and cooler into the long weekend.Low pressure will remain across the UK until the end of the week, bringing further spells of rain, showers and strong wind at times. After a dry and bright start on Thursday, most areas will see showers or longer spells of rain develop through the day. Friday will be another day of showers and it’ll turn windy across eastern areas for a time, but the winds will ease into the weekend as a large area of high pressure builds across the UK from the Atlantic. Chief Meteorologist Frank Saunders said: “We’ve seen a real mix of weather this August - with a heatwave earlier this month and in the last week we’ve had two named storms bringing very wet and windy weather across the country.With high pressure on the way this weekend we’re going to end the month with much more settled weather, with plenty of late summer sunshine for many. It’ll be a dry weekend for most areas too, though eastern areas can expect a few heavy showers on Saturday.” He added: “It’ll feel quite cool despite the sunshine, as northerly winds bring below average temperatures for the time of year with highs of around  to C. At night it’ll feel really quite chilly, with temperatures dropping to single figures for most, and a chance of air frost in Scottish glens.  Looking ahead to the bank holiday weekend, Deputy Chief Meteorologist Chris Tubbs said: “Later on Monday low-pressure will once again start to edge it’s way in from the Atlantic and it’ll turn cloudier with outbreaks of rain for Northern Ireland, with cloud and rain spreading to the rest of the UK by Tuesday.It’s likely to stay unsettled into the remainder of next week as we begin meteorological autumn [on September ], with spells of wind and strong winds at times.” In its long-term forecast for Monday  August to Wednesday  September, the Met Office said: A largely dry day for most on Monday with warm sunny spells at times. Generally light to moderate winds, but perhaps turning cloudier and breezier from the west later with possibly some outbreaks of rain reaching the far west in the evening. Looking further ahead into next week, overall conditions look to turn more unsettled with spells of rain and strong winds, most likely across southern areas.

It is a shame the Prime Minister did not find the time to talk to the parents of the pupils during his visit. He then would have heard first-hand their frustration and dismay over the confused guidance on reopening schools next week. Parents, teachers and unions are crying out for clarity. Instead they have been given conflicting advice, not least on face masks. Earlier this week ministers were adamant there was no need for secondary school pupils in England to wear face coverings. Now they are being told they have to wear them in certain circumstances. This farce comes just days after the exam gradings fiasco. Little wonder that many parents have concluded the Government is making up policy as it goes along. The Prime Minister should spend less time posing for the cameras and more time addressing their concerns. MP class snub Two years ago a report found that bullying and sexual harassment was a signicant problem in Westminster. At the time we were promised a change in the culture at Parliament.  Key to that was MPs attending anti-sexual harassment training. But so far,  Conservative MPs have failed to take the course. This includes the Prime Minister and  other Cabinet ministers.

Shannon Davies, , was prompted to go under the kne in Istanbul, Turkey, after seeing online influencers recommend the clinic - which cannot be named for legal reasons. The salon owner initially forked out £, for a Brazilian Butt lt , breast uplt and augmentation in  but has since ed twice due to shocking results. Shannon, from Pontypridd, Wales, pleaded with the surgeon to remove the excess fat from her bottom but woke to find she had simply undergone another BBL. She is now forced to wear size  trousers as her aposlumpyapos and aposunevenapos bottom doesnapost fit into her old size  jeans. She said: Iaposve always been up and down with my weight and my boobs started to sag. I had no bum and I just wanted a nice curvy body to fill out my clothes. But now I am left with a lumpy bottom and super wide hips as the fat which was injected for the BBL has leaked into my thighs and hips. I regret ever going ahead with the surgery but I just wanted a quick fix.  It seemed like the easy option but I should have just gone to the gym. Shannon recalls feeling like she was in an aposovenapos when she woke from the first surgery in July . Her nipple was purple and she felt like her chest was going to burst open. She adds: I woke up from surgery and I was screaming in pain - it was unbearable. aposI knew something was wrong and I could tell by the look on the surgeons face when he saw my nipple. He removed my nipple and left it hanging on by one thread - I am not too sure how this was supposed to help but I was willing to do anything to avoid losing my nipple. Shannon visited her local nurse every two days to have the stitches and dressing changed for four months after the surgery. She said: I couldnapost wear a bra as it was so painful and my boobs completely dropped. I wasnapost happy at all with the results. A cone had formed on the right side of my leg so I asked the clinicI can have it revised - they eventually agreed after eight months. In March , Shannon flew to Turkey again for three days - she requested another uplt and for fat to be removed for her bum. She claims she was injected three times with general anaesthetic as the dose was initially not enough. She said: The second time was a living nightmare. I was injected in the lt on the way down to theatre but I didnapost fall asleep, nor the second time.  The surgeon told me to get onto the metal bed and then he strapped me down - I was so scared. I wasnapost weighed so they didnapost determine the appropriate dosage! I woke up and my bum was bigger than the first time - he didnapost remove the fat as discussed - he filled it again. Shannon says her botched surgery has left her with a bruised body and an uneven bottom. She flew home after three days and could barely look in the mirror as her new body left her aposhorriedapos. After complaining, the clinic blocked Shannon on social media so she was left to her own devices to try and find someone to revise it. Surgeons have refused in the UK as a BBL is illegal. She said: I was desperate to have everything removed. I just wanted my old body back. In October , Shannon flew back to Turkey for three days to have the implants and fat removed from her bum by the surgeon. However, she claims she awoke to discover no dference. She said: He took my money and all he did was stitch up my boobs again. I have been left with horrendous scarring and barely any confidence. I wanted surgery so I can feel good in my own skin but now I dread summer as I have to cover up. My nipples are too high up and my bottom half is too big.

Typically, -year-old Jacob Pinaaposs thumb measures two inches in , but it can extend to a whopping five and a half inches. Jacob first discovered that his thumb was unique when he was a teenager. And despite how abnormal it is, doctors confirmed that it wasnapost linked to any underlying medical conditions. Now, he has built up an extensive fan base on TikTok for posting regular videos going about his daily le with his incredibly long digit. Whilst a number of people were quick to say it was fake and the videos he had posted had been edited, Jacob was quick to set the record straight.Speaking to Buzzfeed, Jacob confirmed that his expendable thumb is real.He explained: I just dislocate my thumb, by forcing it out of its socket, to make it appear longer.  My doctor says itaposs abnormal but canapost officially link it to any known medical conditions. Since he already has long fingers, he said itaposs hard to notice the freakish nature of his thumb until he dislocates it, which is supposedly painless. Jacob admits that he never expected for his thumb to receive so much recognition, winning him over one million followers.  He said: When I posted my first video to TikTok, I had no clue Iaposd get this sort of attention from it. People have mixed reactions, like disgusted, freaked out, or curious.  When Jacob reacted to a fanaposs comment which read: How is this guy mutating his thumb and scientists are not taking his DNA  TikTok users were extremely freaked out by the sound of the bones in his thumb cracking.

The wind and powerful current had swept the child away from a beach where she was with her parents, and she was almost half a mile from the shoreline when Mr Karnesis carefully moved his ferry into position so the girl could be saved in the Gulf of Corith.Mr Karnesis told Protothema: “The little one was not cool. She was frozen from her fear because the current was very strong. Footage of the extraordinary incident show the little girl sitting calmly as the boat crew plucks her to safety. The clip shows her wearing pink and holding on tightly to her unlikely raft in the wide open ocean as her rescue boats approach. A crowd gathers as a crewman waits at the bottom of the boataposs ramp as her toy floats and closer. The unicorn carrying the child drts toward the boat as the crewman waits with his arms outstretched, and he lunges to pluck her out of the water to safety. Her unicorn floaty toy was also salvaged.  The captain said he was approaching the Port of Antirrio on at about noon on Monday when the Port Authority put out a call saying a child had been swept away from a beach nearby. Local press reported the girl had escaped her parentsapos attention as she played on the toy. When the parents realised that their daughter was out of sight, they alerted the port authority. Mr Karnesis, who captains a local ferry called Salaminomachos, said he spotted the girl and then moved his ferry into position so she could be pulled out of the water.In comments translated by the Greek City Times, he said: I put the ship in such a position so as not to affect the small buoy, I placed it in such a way that the ship was not affected by ripples, becausethe buoy sank we would have serious problems.We approached it slowly and we were able to rescue the child."},{"url":null,"title":"greece records highest number new","story":"NewsGreece records highest number of new cases in new blow for holidaymakersThe surge has sparked fears that Greece could be added to the quarantine list, affecting thousands of Brits set to visit, while holidaymakers out there now face strict rulesShareCommentsByRosaleen FentonExclusives Reporter:,  AUG NewsThere are concerns Greece could be added to the quarantine list for travellers ing to the UK \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

We would say there needs to be a continuing focus on social distancing for kids through smaller classes.“It is possible to have smaller classes but the Scottish Government needs to release more funding. It would also assist children in terms of them catching up, because they have all missed out on so much time in school. Teachers would be able to spend more time with them.“They have got to release money for more teachers to help make classes smaller.#Mr Constable also urged Aberdeen City Council to #go beyond# the Scottish Government#s rules on safety by introducing additional measures.He said: “When the Scottish Government issues advice, we look upon that as the baseline. Local authorities shouldn’t be caught up in just sticking to that – they should be looking at how they can increase that further.“If there are opportunities to stop the transmission of the virus within the local authority, they shouldn’t think they can’t go beyond what the Scottish Government has said. They are able to do that and where they can, they should.“They should be looking at things like whether we should be wearing masks in classrooms, perspex screens and specialist masks for teachers with breathing problems. It’s important councils have an open mind about what can be done on top of the guidance which already exists.”John Wheeler, Aberdeen City Council#s education operational delivery convener, said the local authority was satisfied current safety measures are sufficient.He said: “The national guidance outlines a list of controls that have to be in place and a range of additional controls that can be put in place as an additional precaution.  Schools across the city have worked incredibly hard to put a signicant number of optional controls in place and approaches have been agreed by all staff.#Our data suggests that the controls in place are effective and we continue to monitor things on a daily basis and update approaches in keeping with national advice and local intelligence.#A spokeswoman for the Scottish Government said: “We are already investing £ million to bring additional qualied teachers into classrooms in the new school year, to intensy support for children and young people as theyto full time face-to-face education.“While the recruitment and deployment of teaching staff is a matter for councils, based on their local needs, this funding must be for additional staff on top of the existing teacher workforce and is estimated to be sufficient for local authorities to recruit approximately , people such as post-probationers and recently qualied teachers, as well as any other qualied teachers currently seeking work.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

I’ve spoken to the players about that.‘We know we are not going to win the competition, but we can get to the group stages.“For me, it would feel like a financial win and a win all around. Hopefully we can be that team.”Aberdeen have failed to progress beyond the third qualying round stage in six successive seasons under McInnes.He hopes it will be seventh time lucky in a season in which qualying rounds have been reduced to one leg by Uefa.McInnes is aware the all-or-nothing stature of a single leg makes it more precarious.He said: “If you are the underdog for one game you are underdogs for two games, usually.“With the one-off ties there are fewer minutes to play so for that reason any team who aren’t favourites will have a better chance of going through.‘Whether we are favourites or underdogs, we understand that we have to bring a level of performance that we are happy with.“We’ll give our opponent every respect. Regardless of these early rounds, we’ve always tried to respect our opponent. Any team that beats their opponent - deserves that respect.”Runavik made club history last week by progressing in a European round for the first time.In defeating Barry Town United - in the Faroe Islands, it was the first time in  attempts they had progressed to the next round.In  European matches at preliminary or first qualying round level NSI Runavik have won just three, lost  and drawn two. In , they lost - on aggregate to Hibernian.McInnes said: “I think there is an automatic feeling thatyou have not heard of a team you should be beating them.“Dferent nations are stronger than others, butyou start to look a bit deeper into any opponent you can see there is a calibre of player and performance within each and every team. Runavik are no dferent.“It’s a one-off game. I’ve always felt that ordinarily you need to bring two decent-level performances to get through a tie.“The nature of the competition now means we just need a strong  minutes and hopefully get the job done.”Aberdeen could not send anyone to the Faroe Islands to watch NSI Runavik’s preliminary round due to Covid- travel guidance.McInnes has studied footage of the game, albeit the match was shrouded in heavy fog.Faroe Islands international striker Klaemint Olsen scored a hat-trick. Olsen has scored more than  goals for Runavik.McInnes said: “They’re a very good possession-based team who have good experience and a talismanic striker in Olsen.“We’ve got to make sure we’re good at our own game and bring a level of performance.”Aberdeen have suffered a troubled start to the season with three postponements following coronavirus protocol breaches.The postponements have restricted the Dons to just three Premiership games this season, while, in contrast, Runavik are  games into their league.McInnes said: “We expect a tough match. Their biggest advantage over us is that this is their th game of their season, which started in May.“The benefit of them playing games is that we’ve got to see plenty of them in action. We feel we have a good handle of them.”Aberdeen will hand a late fitness test to Niall McGinn on an ankle injury. Scott McKenna is fit, having been substituted at half-time against Livingston.Funso Ojo is suspended following his red card last season in the - home loss to HNK Rijeka. Craig Bryson , Sam Cosgrove , Mikey Devlinand Ryan Edmondsonare out.McInnes said: “Niall has got a chance. He got a scan on Monday and thankfully it’s nothing sinister. It’s just the nature of the kick that he got.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business.

But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

The village#s fire engine was used to demonstrate to the youngsters how dficult they are to see from the cab of a large goods vehicle, particularly to the rear and near side at junctions.They also learned about primary and secondary road positions, right of way and good observational skills.They were even encouraged to ask their parentsthey do the #Dutch Reach# to keep passing cyclists safe.

Instead of using the hand closest to the door, it means reaching across to open the door with the hand furthest from the door # your left handyou are the driver. This naturally turns your body towards the window, helping you spot approaching cyclists.Mr Catterwell added: #Thanks to Scottish Fire and Rescue Service for the use of the appliance and the drill yard, the Bike Bothy for administrative assistance and training materials and Graham Love for his excellent mechanical services. Also to residents and holiday makers around Craignish who were mostly respectful of the learner cyclists.#P S pupils Fergus Bennett, Beth Gregory, Magnus Hampton, Kay Neville, Harry Whittle and Reiley Van Der Zel received their Bikeability  badges.

The decision was taken to send me to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, and Neil Newman and Billy McArthur drove very carefully on the ersion route to Paisley, avoiding the recently damagedRest and be Thankful route.I am grateful to all those who delivered care to such a high standard, ensuring that my recovery was so successful after excellent treatment at the RAH.Jeremy Houston, PoltallochSir,As I read Councillor Alastair Redman’s letter in the August  edition of the Advertiser I thought how sad it is that a young man should always have such a pessimistic and depressing outlook that he chooses to share regularly with your readers.While we live through a pandemic we have seen the very best in people in our communities working to support and care for each other.Only last week the council publicly thanked the thousands of volunteers for their amazing efforts during the past months.The volunteers throughout our communities worked tirelessly and optimistically, always offering encouragement and kindness helping those who were at home to stay positive during such an anxious time.Local businesses provided an excellent service and continue to do so, enabling people to shop locally without making long journeys.If Councillor Redman cannot see the confident and positive support in all of our communities perhaps he should book an eye test, and he most certainly doesn’t have to travel to Barnard Castle to visit an optician.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertSir,I was delighted to see the piece in a recent issue of the Argyllshire Advertiser featuring a reader from Tayvallich, setting out his case for #Time for Change#. I share many of his concerns, and commend the series of articles.It would be good to hear from a range of Argyll and Bute residents with their ideas for how we get from #here# towards a better #there#. My personal pet project would be an Argyll and Bute Citizens’ Assembly, that would bring people together to generate real strategies to bring about just and #green# change for our area.A good start would be better transport links, via enhanced road and ferry services.A permanent solution to the Rest and be Thankful would be welcome, of course, but it was really heartening to see how Western Ferries rose to the challenge on Friday Auust .  They magicked away that endless queue at Gourock with great patience and goodwill and double service, showing what can be done.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,Following the latest landslide and road closure at the Rest and be Thankful, once again the road closure signs were placed at the wrong place on the Arrochar side.Having spoken to several of the local businesses owners, the main issue around the signs are they are too far away from the incident. There are information signs from Balloch to Tarbet advising of the closure at the Rest.Surely moving the signs to Ardgartan would make more sense. Should anyone have to turn then there is ample space to do this. We cannot continue to render two villages effectively closed in case someone has failed to read the signs or cannot turn.Transport Scotland and BEAR Scotland must guarantee that the signs will not be put back in the same place when further disruption occurs, and it will.Jane Ireland, Slanj restaurant, Tarbet"},{"url":null,"title":"news from the districts august 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMull of Kintyre music festivalhas taken its virtual  event to new heights by beaming a unique Scottish rendition of David Bowie’s #Space Oddity# to the International Space Station.The annual music festival teamed up with the Machrihanish Airbase Community Company , in the running to become the UK’s first spaceport, to record the unique set, featuring local band Slainte Davaar Allstar’s cover of Bowie’s iconic track.With the festival moved online this year the organisers came up with the idea of partnering with the local base and its unconventional location for the exclusive gig.The set was performed on the former top-secret RAF base runway # nearly two miles long and one of the longest in Europe – for current Commander of the ISS Chris Cassidy and Cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner, as they orbit the earth at ,mph.Event manager Iain Johnston of JIG Events said: #The Mull of Kintyre Music Festival has encouraged people to visit Kintyre from all parts of the globe since its inception  years ago and we were naturally disappointed, like every other event organiser up and down the country, to have to cancel this year.

Control system builders ITI will undertake the design, installation and commissioning of the upgrade across the station’s four units.The power station, constructed in a cavern within Ben Cruachan on the shores of Loch Awe, plays a critical role in stabilising the country’s electricity system throughout the Covid- pandemic due to its flexibility. The plant can generate power in less than a minute when needed and can also store excess electricity from the grid like a giant battery, a service which was called upon when the low electricity demand during the lockdown coincided with periods of high wind power in Scotland.The plant’s reversible turbines pump water from Loch Awe to an upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from the grid. The stored water is then released back through the turbines to generate power quickly and reliably when demand increases."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGordon Stewart from Ardfern sent us thisatmospheric photograph, taken from Corranmor Farm on Monday August .A stunning full rainbow appeared that day over Loch Craignish lagoon, captured by Gordon on camera.PIC:no_aYourPictures_Rainbow"},{"url":null,"title":"enjoy cowal highland gathering in the comfort of your own home","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWith just days to go until one of Scotland’s favourite events takes the virtual stage for the first time, Cowal Highland Gathering’s organisers are preparing to unveil a packed programme to a worldwide audience.Cowal’s Virtual Highland Gathering is an ambitious three-day event which mirrors as closely as possible the programme of the gathering itself.Kicking off on Thursday August , Cowal’s Virtual Gathering features a host of exclusive interviews and performances, together with a look back at some of the highlights of the -year-old event.The Gathering’s Friday night gig is back too, with the Gig at the Gathering Unplugged going live from pm.

and those around us.However, people wearing face coverings every day have been noticing that they have started to break out in acne, rashes and skin irritations.Have you had more breakouts since you started wearing a mask We have spoken to Dermalogica skin care expert and beautician Ashley Richards to find out why this happens and how you can protect your skin.What is ldquomaskne Maskne occurs when sweat, oil and bacteria are trapped on your skin while wearing a mask, creating the perfect breeding ground for breakouts.What causes it Maskne is caused by friction, rubbing, and occlusion of the skin by outside forces.Wearing a mask can trap dirt, oil, swear and humidity around the skin.Friction and irritation from the mask pushes bacteria into the skin, which creates micro-tears, and allows the bacteria and dirt to enter the skin more easily.This will lead to blackheads and whiteheads along the bridge of your nose, cheeks and chin. Masks can trigger ious types of skin irritationsand redness .How can you combat maskne There isnrsquot a prevention for maskne, as we need to continue wearing our masks, but there are ways that you can help combat the issues.Skin Care routineIf you want to combat the impact of maskne then having a good skincare routine is essential.It is just as important to cleanse your skin before wearing a mask as it is to cleanse after wearing a mask.To help your skin heal, Ashley would recommend using a squalane or balm cleanser so help remove make-up, dirt and debris.However,you are experiencing chapped, irritated skin or suffer from sensitivity then a gel based cleanseradvised.Dermalogicarsquos UltraCalming Cleanser helps to calm and cool sensitised irritated skin.ExfoliatingExfoliating is key to clear clogged pores and remove dead skin cells which will help reduce the impact of maskne.There are thousands of dferent types of exfoliators available from chemical, physical and masks but it is always important to follow the recommended application and how often you should use the product.Over-exfoliating your skin can compromise your skins barrier , damage the skins capillaries and dehydrate the skin.Ingredients such as glycolic acid, lactic acid and salicylic acid are great exfoliating athelping fight breakouts.Spot treatmentsUsing targeted spot treatments with ingredients such as salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide will help remove dead skin cells and decongest pores.Hyaluronic AcidsHyaluronic acid can hold , times its weight in water - so it is like a magnet for moisture.,params: .pushUsing hyaluronic acid regularly will leave the skin feeling super-soft, radiant and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.Hyaluronic acid has antibacterial properties meaning it will help soothe and protect chapped, irritated skin.FoundationsOpt for tinted moisturisers rather than a heavy foundation or go bare faced to help cause less clogging in your pores - but donrsquot forget your SPF!MoisturisersHeavier moisturisers will sit on the skin for longer due to the humidity of wearing the mask which can cause further clogging and irritation of the skin.However, donrsquot want to stop using a moisturiser all together as our skin still requires hydration and moisture.Instead try using a light and soothing moisturise such as Charlotte Tilburyrsquos Magic Cream light.Chapped SkinFor those suffering from chapped skin try using a physical barrier cream such as Dermalogicarsquos Barrier Repair.Barrier Repair shields against environmental pollution and helps forty sensitive skin with a damaged barrier."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-mobile-testing-unit-hawick---know","story":"A MOBILE-TESTING unitwill run in Hawick for six days, according to NHS Borders.It comes following an outbreak in the townlinked to three businesses.The testing unit will operate from tomorrowuntil Wednesday, September .It will be based in the Teviotdale Leisure Centre car park on Mansfield Road, with tests available between pm-pm.An NHS Borders spokesperson said: \"The MTU can only take a limited number of people each day so it is essential that only people with COVID- symptoms book a test.\"Other household members must self-isolate but should not be tested unless they too are showing any symptoms.\"The symptoms of COVID- are a high temperature or fever a new continuous cough or a loss of or change in sense of smell or taste.\"Tests, which must be booked in advance, can be arranged by visiting this websiteor calling  .The new unit will run alongside the existing facility in Galashiels Netherdale car park, which will operate betweenam and pm.If travellingto a mobile unit is not possible, people can arrange for a home test kit to be posted through their door.NHS Borders jointdirector of public health, Tim Patterson, said: \"I realise that people in Hawick will have concerns about the virus as a result of this outbreak.\"Unfortunately this can lead to the circulation of unsubstantiated rumours, especially on social media.\"I would like to re-iterate that it is crucial for everyone in the community to follow our advice and avoid speculation and rumour about the outbreak.\"Dr Patterson added: \"In terms of schools, all education settings in Hawick are currently safe places for children to learn.\"Unless your child has been asked to self-isolate by NHS Borders Test and Protect team they should attend school as normal.\"However it remains vital that no child attends schoolthey are displaying any COVID- symptoms.\"At the time of publication, a total of nine new cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the Borders in recent days,bringing the regions total to  since the outbreak began.To book a testing unit appointment or a free home testing kit, visit: www.gov.uk get-coronavirus-test or you can call:   "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-book-covid-test-testing-centres","story":"In the last week, demands for Covid testing in Scotland have surged.The First Minister suggests some Scots have had trouble trying to book coronavirus tests over the weekend due to a \"major spike\" in demand, which resulted in technical issues.Butyou are experiencing symptoms, how do you get a test  Heres everything you need to know.When should you take a test If you think you are experiencing symptoms of coronavirus, you should take a test.

Itrsquos not so easy to access, but the fact the trees are now under threat made me want to discover the place before it might be too late. As I write, the decision has yet to be made on the fate of the trees.Irsquom a lover of history and totally understand the need to create a safe, weather-proof home for these historic planes, and to keep the museum as much an authentic visiting experience as possible. But there is a huge amount of space in the existing museum area, so the destruction of woodland seems unnecessary.The museum argues that any additional modern structures near the runway will undermine the historic look of the airfield. The proposed new visitor centre will, they say, create much-needed new jobs. So cutting down the trees to move the planes and create a new home for them is, the museum authorities argue, the only realistic option for them. They say that refusal of their plans will put the new jobs at risk.I totally understand the need for jobs at this time in particular, but the trouble is the approach taken by the museum is part of the reason the world is facing an ecological crisis with deforestation, the destruction of habitats and the extinction of wildle. It is part of the mindset that sees nature as ldquoin the way of development.Donrsquot be ridiculously dramatic, I hear some folks say this is not the Amazon or a rainforest in Indonesia, itrsquos a small wood in East Lothian.And that is precisely the point. It is a small but very rare example of a wood with mature trees in our county. It is a special place, with a ersity of trees and buzzing with wildle. Walk under its canopy and you will discover that. I know itrsquos proposed to plant new trees in a dferent area as compensation, but this wonrsquot connect to the wood and will take generations to grow. It will never replace what will be lost.If we seriously want to do something about the ecological disaster we are making on our planet then we need to start in our own backyard. We canrsquot campaign against deforestation, habitat destruction and declare a climate emergency, and then say: ldquoWell, the rules donrsquot apply to us when we want to destroy woodland to move some planes.Deforestation has a multitude of justications all over the world: dam building, road construction, cattle ranching, extreme poverty of subsistence farmers, profit from timber, oil exploration and pipelines, mining: the list is long. The point is there will always be someone with an economic justication for environmental destruction.While it may be on a much smaller scale, the proposal to destroy irreplaceable woodland in order to move some planes is a product of the same mindset that has brought us to a point of environmental and climate crisis.This mindset is revealed in the Historic Environment Scotland response to the proposal. This is the public body charged with protecting Scotlandrsquos built heritage. It has said: ldquoWe would not consider the trees of Sunnyside Strip to be directly related to the cultural signicance of the scheduled monument ndash they are visible but do not relate to our understanding of the monument as a wartime airfield.In other words, woodland isnrsquot part of our heritage mature trees, many of which were around before the war, arenrsquot historic or worthy of value in themselves. Really The wood is far more a historic part of the wartime airfield site than the massive car park. It seems to be a very selective viewpoint.The truth is that the UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries on the planet. A quarter of our already-decimated wild mammals are in danger of extinction. Our woodlands are small and dispersed, but all the more vital for the habitat they provide. East Lothian has huge developmental pressure, and this wood is a rare and vital part of naturersquos increasingly precarious foothold in our county.A changed mindset would be one which makes the protection of nature and the environment the initial default position. Developers should then take this priority as the starting point for proposals.That hasnrsquot happened with this plan, and credit to the council for rejecting it.There has been so much publicity and justied outrage recently over the destruction and littering of our land by people lsquowildrsquo camping and disrespecting nature. So many people, it seems, just donrsquot care, or seem unable to appreciate the gt of our natural environment and its importance.There is a disconnect from nature at the heart of this. We will never solve the environmental and climate crisis we are in until we can foster love and appreciation of nature, of which we are a part. Our childrenrsquos future literally depends on this.And institutions such as National Museums Scotland should be part of the solution, not the problem. Instead of viewing the woodland as irrelevant to the visitor experience, it could be used to enhance it. The wood is a magic place, with younger trees growing amidst towering old mature ones.My kids were in wonder as they explored the wood, peering up at the tops of the trees, and an old oak caught their attention as its boughs seemed to dip asto say hello. We spent a wonderful hour being immersed in nature.Many of our children, in fact many adults, have limited opportunities to explore and enjoy such places. Imagine the extra possibility of a nature walk in the tall wood, where wildle thrives and trees older than the airfield can tell their story.

This is how I heard about an otter at the Esk for the first time three years ago.A few people mentioned they had seen this elusive creature a few years ago, but never since.The otter became my new photography challenge. I tried visiting the river at dferent times of the day, especially at dawn and dusk, when otters are more active, always trying to keep the noise down to a minimum.After two years of searching, my hope was gone and I almost gave up. Until one sunny day in April during lockdownhellipThe weather that day was enjoyable, so Chris and I decided to go on a walk. The local path was very busy the dog walkers, cyclists, families with children and joggers were enjoying the sun whilst social distancing.As always, I kept my eyes low on the water hoping to see the kingfisher.As we followed the river upstream to the area at The Grove, I spotted something moving in the water.I grabbed Chrisrsquo hand and I pulled him down on the ground right behind a bush.It was not a kingfisher but something I did not expect to see in the middle of the day... an otter fishing!We managed to crawl down the slope and lie down so we would not disturbit.Whilst I was photographing the otter, I also heard a cheery pee-pee-pee and saw the kingfisher flying past the otter. What a day!Since then I have seen the otter a couple more times.The Eurasian otter is a secretive, semi-aquatic species with chocolate brown fur, webbed feet, and a powerful tail. Their thick coats are built of two layers of fur: an inner layer that works as insulation, and the outer, waterproof layer. The two-layered system prevents their skin from direct contact with water and subsequent temperature loss.Their nostrils and ears stay closed as otters swim underwater.Despite being excellent swimmers, they cannot hold their breath underwater for long periods the average time underwater is about  seconds as they e.Otters are solitary, territorial animals, that live in underground holes called lsquoholtsrsquo. The size of their territory ies and depends on the quality of the habitat, amount of food and number of possible holts.It is also known that a male otter has a larger territory that can even overlap several female ottersrsquo territories. Otters usually have a well-defined area within their grounds in which they feed, rest and breed.Seeing signs of otters is generally easier than seeing the animals themselves. If you happen to find yourself at the riverbank or a sea loch, look for five-toed footprints and otter droppings , that are left in places such as fallen trees, rocks and weirs.Spraints are easily identiable as they contain visible fish bones and have a characteristic and not particularly unpleasant smell that has been described as ranging from fish to freshly brewed jasmine tea!The otter that you may see at the coast is very often called a lsquosea otterrsquo however, this is the same species as the animals that live further inland.If you would like to share how you get on finding the otters oryou have any rare kind of wildle in your area, I would love to hear from you.Speak to you next month!zanslensfacebook zanslens instagram zans_lens twitter zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"retired-musselburgh-nurse-writes-book-caring-people-dementia","story":"Dee Jenkins, , of Eskmills Road, said the main aim of the publication ndash I Remember Dementia ndash was to encourage carers of dementia patients.Born in Dublin in , Mrs Jenkins, who has lived in Musselburgh for  years, came to Scotland in  to enter a religious order, the Novitiate for the Sisters of La Sagesse, at Leuchie House, North Berwick.

The lsquomust-seersquo jewels that should be on the wish list of every tourist and local alike ndash the ones that actually surpass expectations and leave a lasting impression once yoursquove seen them.And for lovers of whisky, there are more than a few of these places too ndash the distilleries whose images take pride of place on websites and in magazines and which inhabit the dreams of fans around the world.The lonely trio clinging on to the rocks of Islayrsquos southern shore, their white walls standing as stark protection against the sea ndash Ardbeg, Lagavulin, Laphroaig.The architectural masterpiece that is Macallan, just outside the village of Craigellachie on Speyside ndash only a couple of years old, but already a global icon.And the old walls of the Blair Athol distillery in Pitlochry, so consumed by ivy itrsquos asthe stems and not the stone are keeping the place upright.Irsquove been to Islay, and to Macallan ndash and both more than lived up to my imagination. But while Irsquove driven past Blair Athol so many times Irsquove lost count, Irsquove never actually been able to go and visit.So when an invitation popped up on my email ndash come and visit, and bring someone with you. I would normally have been delighted. Irsquod been planning to take my dad for a day out, and this would normally have been the perfect thing. I would normally have been excited at the prospect of us both actually seeing first-hand this lovely little distillery.But, letrsquos face it, I wouldnrsquot normally expect such an invitation to come in the middle of a pandemic, and I wouldnrsquot normally need to do an impromptu risk assessment before accepting.The Scotch whisky industry is worth upwards of pound billion to the UK economy and millions of tourists flock to distillery visitor centres every year, eager to touch base with one of the most popular drinks in the world. In recent years, the industry has enjoyed record growth ndash and all the signs were that  would be another bumper season.But then Covid struck, the country went into lockdown, and visitor centres closed their doors.However, since last month, when restrictions began to ease and Scottish tourism began to get back to work, the industry has slowly been welcoming visitors.The owner of Blair Athol, drinks giant Diageo, is in the middle of its own rolling programme of reopening. It began with the Pitlochry distillery in the last week of July and will go on throughout summer and well into the autumn.At this time of year, a place like Blair Athol would normally see hundreds of visitors every day, with tour parties of  or more being guided past the giant mash tuns ndash where ground malted barley, or grist, is mixed with hot water to extract the sugars that will give le to the whisky ndash and given a peek inside the washbacks ndash where this sugary broth, or wort, is mixed with yeast and left to ferment to create a strong lsquobeerrsquo ready for distillation.Dozens more would normally just drop in to buy a bottle in the shop, or to enjoy a drink at the Mash Tun ndash a whisky tasting bar thatrsquos open to the public.But lsquonormalrsquo was the last word on our minds as my dad and I drove through the depths of Perthshire on our way to Pitlochry.Wersquod had to book our slot, as drop-ins are no longer allowed, and been given the usual spiel about precautions, social distancing, sanitiser and the like, but Irsquod heard it all so often by now that it barely registered. Itrsquos become like the safety briefing on a holiday flightbefore take off.Irsquove been to a lot of distilleries before, and normally I love the atmosphere, the peaceful way these places ndash in reality some of Scotlandrsquos busiest industrial sites ndash go about their business, but I didnrsquot know what to expect this time round. Would the experience be ruined, like a trip to the shops or a pint down the pub Wersquod been told to bring our obligatory mask ndash and warned that our temperatures would be taken.Groan.So as we walked up to the door and announced ourselves, I steeled myself for some military-style regime of control and discipline.ldquoHello, come in! The tour is about to start. Can I ask you to put your wrist up to the censor so we can check your temperature That was it hellip a little box on the wall not much bigger than a light switch. I held up my wrist as instructed and waited.ldquoBeep! Temperature normal.My dad followed and as the tape across the entrance was pulled back we proceeded to put on our masks.ldquoOh, no, you wonrsquot need these in here.And what turned out to be one of the best tours Irsquove ever been on had begun.Yes, there was sanitiser everywhere, and wersquod been asked to maintain our distance and keep to the one-way system, but far from being a hindrance, these quiet measures seemed to fit in with the feel of the place, and did nothing to detract from the tour.There were only four of us on the tour, and the usually busy public areas were deserted, so it felt aswersquod been given secret, after-hours access to the distillery.It was aswe had the place to ourselves and Karen, our guide, was our accomplice as we sneaked from room to room, past the mash tuns and the washbacks, and into the still room. We stopped here as Karen explained the distilling process and, despite the insane heat of production, we stayed a little while extra to chat and take pictures. This personal touch was a real and unexpected treat.We carried on like this right through the tour ndash Karen passing on her prodigious knowledge, us chatting and stopping to admire the beauty of the distillery. No crowds, no rush.The final pleasure was when we were led into the Mash Tun bar to sample the whisky. It was like an exclusive tasting normally only reserved for the big-rollers and high-payers. I was driving, so after a quick snf of each dram ndash Blair Athol -year-old, Blair Athol Distillery Exclusive, Auchroisk -year-old, and Talisker Storm, in case yoursquore interested ndash I decanted them into the little sample bottles provided and saved them for later.Dad, on the other hand, loved every second of this private display, and after chatting a while more to our fellow guests and Karen ndash ldquostay as long as you like, she reassured us ndash we nipped off to take more photos and visit the distillery shop.The shop was the only place where masks were needed, but it didnrsquot stop us marvelling at the goodies on offer, and chatting some more to the staff who seemed to be relishing this newfound ability to escape from the timetable.Dad bought a bottle, of course ndash Talisker Storm ndash and as we said our goodbyes and took a few more pictures, I vowed to be back in more normal times.But then again, maybe I wonrsquot wait until then and instead book another secret visit when it feels aswe have the place to ourselves.Maybe this new normal has something going for it after all.# Andy Clark is author of the Dr@m whisky blog.

Although their summits are mostly rounded and sweeping, they combine to make a vast and wholly unique landscape.The mountains in the Cairngorms rise up out of the remnants of the ancient Caledonian pinewoods and are home to superb wildle and an array of dramatic corries. Braeriach is the third highest mountain in the British Isles and is protected by a long approach walk through a natural tree line.This Munro comes in at km and takes around - hours to complete.Braeriach, Aviemore, PH QTBraeriachBeinn Alligin, TorridonBeinn Alligin, meaning jewelled mountain, is one of three of the Torridon giants and well deserving of its name. This magnicent pair of munros has its own pinnacle ridge called the Horns of Alligin.Sitting on the seaward side of Torridon it has an unmatched viewpoint with glimpses of Skye and the sea to one side, and great peaks on the other side with the Horns providing a stunning foreground.The Munro is around km and takes around - hours.Beinn Alligin Torridon, Alligin, AchnasheenBuachaille Etive Mor, Glen CoeBuachaille Etive Mor is the head of Glen Coe and reigns supreme with its awe-inspiring pyramidal appearance. It is affectionately known by many climbers as the Bookie and, along with its twin Buachaille Etive Beag, are among the most photographed of the Scottish mountains and itrsquos easy to see why!This Munro is perfect for those who want a climb and some incredible views.It is around km and takes around - hours to complete.Aonach Eagach Ridge, A, Ballachulish PH HXLiathach, TorridonAnother of Torridonrsquos three mountains, Liathach is perhaps the finest of them all. Its higher Munro looks almost inaccessible from most directions and even the easiest ascent involves a bit of scrambling but itrsquos certainly worth the effort.Beyond this point the mountain becomes even more dramatic and offers the perfect path for thrill seekers to climb to the top. The hidden north side of the mountain is even more spectacular and is well worth exploring.Slightly longer than the other of Torridonrsquos mountains this walk is around .km and takes around - hours.Achnasheen, IV ETLiathachSgurr nan Gillean, SkyeMany regard Sgurr nan Gillean as being the finest peak on Skye and it is one of the more dficult on this list. Even the easiest ascent on the southeast ridge is a pretty tough scramble ndash the other two ridges venturing into the realm of rock climbing.It appears fairly dramatic from Sligachan but this actually conceals much of the mountainrsquos finest features and its only upon a closer visit to Coire a Bhasteir that the true scale and magnicence of the Pinnacle Ridge reveals this Munrorsquos true stature.This walk is around km and takes roughly  to  hours to complete.Skye, IV SW"},{"url":null,"title":"gardening-10-bulbs-buy-now-add-zing-spring","story":"You may still be enjoying the summer, butyou want a gorgeous display of spring bulbs, you need to start planting them soon.Narcissi, snowdrops, grape hyacinths, fritillarias and tulips all make great displays, and can be planted from late summer through to the end of autumnyou want a riot of colour in spring.:Gardening: Will my dahlias look their best So check out these favourites to plant this year for a fantastic spring display....

IRIS GERMANICA MISSION RIDGENew from Suttons, but not exclusively, these bearded irises produce exotic blooms of snowy white and lilac-blue, but are not strictly bulbs. They grow from rhizomes, fleshy tubers planted on their sides near the soil surface.

This resulted in  new cases being detected - a positivity rate of . per cent.In the seven days to August , the number of people being tested had risen sharply to ,, with  new cases identied - a .% positivity rate.Many of these iniduals will have been tested more than once across the NHS and community sites we are now performing more than , Covid antigen tests per week - the highest turnover since the pandemic began.: Scotland to roll out -minute Covid testsDespite this sudden upswing in demand - and bearing in mind that the vast majority of testing is carried out on iniduals with possible Covid symptoms - % of those tested are still coming back negative for the Sars-CoV- virus.While some of these may be  negatives, it is also a strong indicator of just how many non-Covid viral infections are circulating in the community causing coughs and fevers.Young children have also long been known to be lsquosuperspreadersrsquo of colds and flu - yet the same does not appear to be true for the newest strain of coronavirus behind the pandemic.Emerging evidence suggests that older children aged  and over can infect others with Covid in much the same way as adults, however, leading the World Health Organisation to update its guidance to advise that teenagers should wear facemasks in certain circumstances.There is less concern about the danger of the virus to children and adolescents per se. The evidence is overwhelming that the age group is at extremely low risk of serious illness or complications.The real alarm surrounds their potential to pass the infection on to adults on campus, or to bring it home to family members who may be a greater risk.Yet even this is unclear.: Fresh call to lt cap on medical school intake for A Public Health England study published on Sunday analysed outbreaks linked to primary and pre-school children during June.Of the million or so children attending,  children and  members of staff were infected in  separate outbreaks - but PHE said most had probably been caused by staff members infecting other staff members, with only two instances apparently linked to pupild infecting other pupils.However, a study by French epidemiologist Arnaud Fontanet at a school in France found that although younger age groups do not \"transmit to the same extent\", \"teenagers are just as contagious as adults\".Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor of cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, told the Independent that it was best to ldquoerr on the side of caution when discussing whether the coronavirus can be transmitted to adults by children.ldquoTherersquos not a mountain of evidence on both sides,\" he said. \"The fact is we know very little about this, precious little.The bottom line, however, is that our testing capacity has not kept pace with the predictable surge in demand caused by schools reopening.The same pattern is occurring in countries such as South Korea, where schools in Seoul were forced to close and revert back to distance learning this week after the th consecutive day of triple-digit daily increases in coronavirus cases. At least  students and teachers have tested positive over the past two weeks in the Seoul city region.Germany too was forced to completely or partially close some of its schools or quarantine pupils and teachers within days of the new term two weeks ago. In Berlin,  schools have been affected by Covid- cases.The messaging in Scotland was clear: schools could only open safely as long as anyone with possible symptoms stayed home and got tested straightaway.: Contact tracing will only prevent outbreakstesting carried out within  hours of symptomsModelling by academics from University College London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that reopening of schools in England in September could lead to a second, bigger wave of coronavirus by December unless a \"comprehensive test, trace and isolate strategy\" was in place. This took into account other factors - such as parents being freed up toto offices- but it illustrates the importance of sufficient and rapid testing capacity.The fact that our testing capacity has been overwhelmed so quickly - evensome of it is confusion among people told to self-isolate wrongly seeking tests - is far from ideal.On the plus side, the test results we do have so far indicate that Covid is only behind around one in every  cases of flu-like illness."},{"url":null,"title":"labours-richard-leonard-dragging-party-him-fmqs-ineptitude","story":"Mr Leonard, who was ignored calls for him to quit ahead of next years Holyrood election, was accused of entering ldquopolitically suicidal territory after pressing Nicola Sturgeon on a host of issues the First Minister has already committed to.

On the basis of past performance there is limited assurance and confidence that the council can make the signicant depth of improvement needed.ldquoThe Accounts Commission have instructed auditors to follow up on todayrsquos report, with a further assessment of the councilrsquos position within  months.ldquoCouncillors and officers must build on recent steps to work collaboratively to address poor educational attainment, ensure its finances are sustainable in the longer term and better understand how its services are performing.The council has started work on an action plan to address the findings over the next  months.A spokesperson for Moray Council said that the report ldquomakes dficult reading and ldquoprovides a sharpened focus on the challenges we face.The spokesperson added: ldquoDelivering the committed and decisive leadership called for by the Accounts Commission requires acceptance of change in the way the council works, at both officer and member level. Vital to this will be greater collaboration to pave the way for transformation at strategic level in both our school estate and the delivery of our services to the Moray community.ldquoOur continuing experience dealing with the Covid- pandemic has thrown the need for strong partnership working collaboration into sharp relief and the council will do all in its power to ensure that lessons will be learned from this.ldquoTo deliver transformation, over pound million has been earmarked from council reserves to address issues highlighted in the report - including pace and capacity.

Quant, born in Blackheath, London, became a household name in the s, as part of the youthquake that revitalised British culture in music, fashion and film.She may not have been the first designer to take hemlines above the knee , but the very short skirt and sht dresses, more often than not modelled by Twiggy, became Quantrsquos trademark. Her bobbed hair, designed by Vidal Sassoon, also added to Quantrsquos recognition factor. She was also responsible for the skinny rib sweater and hot pants.Quantrsquos designs grew out of her desire for a new look and new ideas of what it might be to be female. ldquoI grew up not wanting to grow up, she once said. ldquoGrowing up seemed terrible. It meant having candy-floss hair, stiletto heels, girdles and great boobs. To me it was awful children were free and sane and grown-ups were hideous.Her notions chimed with the times and as a result she did much to shape how the s looked, in the streets of Cha and the fashion magazines and weekend newspaper supplements of the time at least.Quant met her future husband Alexander Plunket Greene while studying illustration at Goldsmithrsquos. He was from old money, but very much a Soho bohemian. In s London the couple were part of the much-vaunted Cha Set. ldquoOur friends and acquaintances were painters, photographers, architects, writers, socialites, actors, con-men, and superior tarts, Quant said in her  memoir Quant on Quant.In  the couple, along with business partner Archie McNair, bought a Kingrsquos Road with plans to open it as a boutique, with Plunket Greenersquos bistro downstairs.Originally, the boutique, called Bazaar, sold clothes Quant sourced herself from art school students, jewellers and milliners, very much a reflection of her own taste. When that proved successful and stock dwindled, she took to buying fabric from Harrods and made up her own designs with her friends in her bedsit overnight to sell in the shop the next morning.Quantrsquos clothes were informal, often in bold colours, and she had an eye for reinventing traditional details. She also had a taste for new materials including PVC, using it to create wet-look clothes. Her designs could be androgynous, taking familiar material, designs and ideas from menswear and using them to her own ends.Kellie Wilson modelling satin shirt and matching shorts from Mary Quants intimate apparel range, ldquoAll the way through le women had to dresshellipthe way the man in her le saw her, Quant pointed out. ldquoShe was never allowed to dress the part of being her. I wanted to design clothes for real people.In  she signed a deal with the American store chain JC Penney and a year later she launched a new, cheaper dfusion line, Ginger Group. By the end of the decade she was the countryrsquos most recognisable fashion designer and it was estimated that up to seven million women in the UK owned at least one of her products.She ersied into cosmeticsand in the s interior designs, including carpets, bed linen and wallpaper, for manufacturer ICI.ldquoClothes are a statement about oneself or what one wants to be, Quant believed. It was an idea that she put into practice for herself.Mary Quant at VA Dundee runs until January , .

Despite the challenges, it has also made us consider how we can approach things dferently to suit the emerging ldquonew world.It has provided businesses with the opportunity to extend their geographical boundaries. Brightsolidrsquos customer base has been typically based in Scotland ndash but by no means do we have to limit ourselves to the way things were ldquoalways done pre-pandemic.The business community has already taken steps to change ndash firstly when we moved our workforces overnight to remote working. While there may have been some early hiccups to the process for some, for the vast majority it has been proven that it can work. Andyou are like me, although I miss seeing my colleagues in person, I donrsquot feel any less connected to them or our customers given the rise in video calls and messaging s.This leads neatly to the concept of glocalisation which has gained traction during the pandemic ndashthe practice of conducting business that considers both local and global environments. Before Covid- hit, many might not have believed themselves ready to trade with a wider audience or look at hiring someone from a citywhere they are not based. But these limits no longer exist. This is an opportunity to rethink mindsets, and the business tactics and technologies needed to support this.A glocalised approach will provide businesses with opportunities. Integral to that is technology which provides the tools to think bigger an opportunity to speak to, reach and work with more people. Many may have already adopted a glocalised approach to their business without realising ndash by launching websites to deliver services when customers couldnrsquot visit physical premises, or have the infrastructure in place to conduct and close sales meetings irrespective of location. Central to enabling that is the cloud which will help businesses get their websites and apps online or provide staff with access to files remotely quickly and securely ndash meaning that they can continue operating with limited interruption to the day to day.Long gone are the days when technology was only the responsibility of the IT team. The cloud has made it more accessible and we are likely to see HR and marketing teams playing a larger role in making technology decisions that impact the business. The involvement of these departments will mean that teams can react and innovate quickly to provide the services they need to make workplaces more attractive to new candidates, customers and current employees alike. This could have positive results, as organisations will be able to tap into a broader talent pool, closing any skills gap that might have existed or allow them to approach a company with a proposal that they may have not previously considered due to their location.While, naturally, there will remain many tough hurdles for us to face we must take the current situation and harness the power to better ourselves and the businesses we work within. I donrsquot doubt that a glocalised approach will be integral to business success ndash both now and as we emerge from the pandemic. To thrive, we must harness the opportunity and take time to review existing processes. It is likely technology will be the solution that helps us navigate beyond the here and now and towards growth again.Linda King is CMO, Brightsolid"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-eight-fold-increase-under-17s-tested-covid-scotland","story":"Nicola Sturgeon said nearly , children aged two to  were tested for the virus last week, but stressed that only  - . per cent - had a positive result.The First Minister said this should be \"reassuring to parents and teachers\" worried about the impact of schools reopening on the spread of coronavirus.It came as the number of cases identied as part of the Kingspark School cluster in Dundee rose to , including  cases among staff and three in pupils from the same class.The additional support needs school for children aged five to was closed for deep-cleaning last Wednesday as a result of the outbreak, with staff and pupils told to self-isolate as a precaution for  days.: The surge in demand for testing was predicatable - but the results should be reassuringMs Sturgeon said: \"I know and I can well understand why many parents and teachers and young people themselves have concerns about theto school, and yes, weve had clusters of cases in some communities involving young people, but I think these figures reveal the bigger picture.\"Ms Sturgeon added that despite a % increase in testing among this age group between the week ending August  and August , only two additional cases were detected last week.Scottish Government figures also show that in the week to August , a total of , people in Scotland were newly tested for Covid- - with  cases detected.That suggests that children under  accounted for % of those tested, but only % of positive cases.Ms Sturgeon stressed that parents should not be seeking a Covid test for cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose, unless this was also accompanied by at least one of the three official Covid- symptoms such as a new persistent cough, a fever, or a loss or change in sense of smell or taste.She said: \"While its understandable that parents in particular want to err on the side of caution, its also important to remember the symptoms of Covid that trigger the need for a test: a new persistent cough, a fever, a loss or change in sense of taste or smell.\"Other symptoms like a runny nose -they are not accompanied by one of the Covid symptoms - should not lead to a test.\"The surge in demand for testing through community sites such as drive-thru centres led to some people being told their nearest available booking slot was in England.Ms Sturgeon said \"technical issues\" with the booking system had also been to blame and were being resolved.Overall, more than , Covid tests per week are currently being carried out in Scotland across NHS and community sites, up from around , in mid-July.However, three additional mobile testing units are being deployed this week to increase capacity by  to  per day.NHS Scotland has also ordered thousands of new Covid testing kits capable of providing results within  minutes."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-scotland-celebrated-international-dog-day","story":"Founded in  by animal welfare advocate Colleen Page, pet owners and animal lovers alike honour their dogs every  August.The aim is to acknowledge all the dogs that need to be rescued everyday, as well as honour the dogs who provide support to people who need them.:Ten dogs found filthy and emaciated on A near JedburghYesterday, the annual tributes poured in for Scottish pups in every shape and size ndash and herersquos a look at your favourite snaps of manrsquos best friend.Happy International Dog Day!

Unlike student nurses and midwives, however, those training to be a paramedic are not eligible for a bursary, despite being unable to take up part time work.  To add insult to injury, their counterparts in England do receive bursaries.“This lack of a level playing field risks putting off those we need to see coming into our health service.  The current arrangements do little to encourage young people to pursue a career as a paramedic and store up problems for the future.“When I wrote to the Health Secretary recently on behalf of a constituent, I was told the government has no plans to review the funding options for trainee paramedics. Today, Nicola Sturgeon said she would look into the matter, having also been approached by a young constituent, angry at the unequal treatment.“The First Minister needs to recognise that introducing a bursary scheme would make a real dference, not least in widening access to the profession.  It’s time the Scottish Government properly recognised the dedication of our trainee paramedics by putting them on the same footing as trainee nurses and midwives.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On the Pentland Firth, people are still being forced to pay over the odds.“COVID has inevitably created challenges, but even prior to the pandemic there seemed to be little urgency from the Scottish Government to deliver on its promise. Assurances that Ministers will now ‘pick up the ball again’ are likely to ring hollow with islanders who just want a date for cheaper fares to be introduced.“Meantime, Ministers could help soften the blow from the delayed introduction of RET by using the underspend to cut fares on Orkney’s internal ferry services.

The infrastructure proposals have been designed to enable Orkney to manage a transition away from fossil fuels, while continuing to generate social and economic benefit from ongoing oil and gas activity.The proposals will have #transformational# impact on Orkney#s economy and society. As well as creating as many  new jobs, there will also be a substantial number of job opportunities during the construction phase.OIC leader James Stockan said: “Our vision is to build a truly sustainable business that is a core economic asset for Orkney, but also a first phase in enabling a scale of investment and logistical capability for the UK, which will be of international signicance.“Prime Minister Boris Johnson clearly welcomed our ambition and Orkney’s potential during his recent visit to our islands, describing as a ‘fantastic idea’ our vision for Orkney as a low-carbon, zero-emissions hub of innovation, with Scapa Flow at its heart.“We believe the time is right to maximise the incredible natural assets and geography of Scapa Flow and Orkney, to ensure a long-term sustainable future for our communities. We are open for business now, and ready to work with potential investors and operators to develop the signicant strategic and international opportunities Scapa Flow offers.“The Scapa Deep Water Quay proposal has been included in the Islands Deal list of projects that has received funding commitment from the Scottish and UK governments, and we are continuing to ensure that the funding earmarked for this will be secured.”Central to the project is the unique geographical advantage of Scapa Flow, described by the council as the largest natural deep-water harbour in the northern hemisphere, as the potential setting for internationally signicant marine logistics to serve the new and emerging sectors, including low-carbon fuel transition and offshore wind developments.Scapa Deep Water Quay is seen as the optimal location for construction and operations and maintenance activities, associated with offshore wind, as well as for a liquefied natural gasstorage and distribution hub. At the same time, this infrastructure has the capability to accommodate semi-submersible s of all types, giving Orkney a unique UK competitive edge within the existing oil and gas market.The project team believes it could be delivered by . Other proposals, such as Hatston and Kirkwall, could take three or four years to deliver.Phase two will ultimately develop the islands’ smaller harbours and piers across the islands.Harbour users and key stakeholders were consulted from the outset, to help gain an understanding of the issues, constraints and opportunities associated with harbour infrastructure around Orkney, through workshops and interviews. The range of stakeholders includes local communities, harbour users, potential funders and environmental bodies such as Scottish Natural Heritage.Harbourmaster James Buck added: “Tackling decarbonisation is the strand that binds these proposals together, providing infrastructure and knowledge for renewable energy developments around our waters will allow us to reach climate change targets. “We will also look at the potential for net environmental gain through habitat reinstatement and enhancement.”According to the OIC, Orkney Harbours is one of the most erse and successful council-run port authorities in the UK, with an annual turnover of £ million and nearly , annual vessel movements.The council added that the exact timing of construction for each of the phase one masterplan proposals is not yet known.This will be determined over the next six to  months, and will depend on a range of factors including market requirements, funding and environmental considerations.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But this week he wished a fond farewell to his feathered friend and sent her on a southbound trip that involved local RSPB manager Helen Moncrieff, NorthLink Ferries and an Aberdeenshire-based horse transportation company, which offered to take Patricia back to her home coop.Patricia should be reunited with her grateful owner this weekend. Eighty-two year-old John Wheeler lives in the far-off village of Hucclecote ndash over  miles away.Mr Jamieson said his suspicions that he may have had more than just an ordinary pigeon on his hands arose when Patricia appeared reluctant to leave.ldquoIt was in our hen run and the hens were making a commotion, he said.ldquoIt was just a rag of bones. It had been released in Thurso.Further inspections revealed a ring on one of Patriciarsquos legs, and a white marking on the other.That led to an online trawl that uncovered a useful website which helped put Mr Jamieson in touch with Patricia#s rightful owner. for full story...Ryan Taylor has worked as a reporter since , and has been at The Shetland Times since , covering a wide iety of news topics.Before then he reported for other newspapers in the Highlands, where he was raised, and in Fe, where he began his career with DC Thomson.

The rest were reduced by a single grade and she has missed out on As in English, Biology and Modern Studies, as well as a C in Higher Chemistry.Eva said to have her grades knocked down so signicantly has made her “completely reconsider her career path”.Exams were cancelled this year because of Covid- and replaced with estimated grades based on past attainment, and the school’s previous exam record.The modelling system adapted by the Scottish Qualications Authority reduced the grades of around , results, with analysis suggesting youngsters from poorer backgrounds and historically poorer performing schools suffered disproportionately.In her letter, shared almost , times on Twitter, Eva said that “it was clear” that her grades had been signicantly adjusted “because I go to a school classed as underperforming”.Her letter calls for the system, which she describes as discriminatory, to be urgently investigated, adding: “The government has been pushing the ‘no wrong path slogan’ but why should pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds and deprived areas be forced into a pathway they didn’t want and worked tirelessly to avoid”.Eva had been predicted in her fourth year to achieve  As and two Cs at national five level, but in her exams she improved to come out with five As and a B.She added that her school’s recent performance had been affected by staff shortages.She had stayed behind after school for extra tuition, aiming to secure a university place and a career in the field of medicine.“Any further efforts by pupils to achieve higher grades in schools which have historically underperformed has been disregarded, she added.“SQA results this year have been more about fitting the statistical trends than the inidual pupil.”According to the Scottish Government#s own statistics, the estimated . per cent of most deprived pupils who would have expected an A-C band at Higher was lowered to . per cent by the SQA#s moderation system.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.jpg","title":"royal celtic societys unique music","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWork has begun on processing the twenty entries received for a unique competition which set the country’s musicians the challenge of creating a new shinty composition.

Kerry McWilliams, the founder of Lightwork NI, a charity that has provided more than  sessions of direct support to families over the past two months, said the crossover between school and family le was a major issue for many of the people she has worked with throughout the pandemic. Kerry said they have found that while children were largely able to keep in touch with the outside world and their peers through the likes of social media, many were uncomfortable being taught by their parents. And she said the stresses experienced by some groups of parents, such as key workers or those who had lost their income, made it more dficult for adults to support their children effectively. Home schooling was a cause of signicant conflict and distress, she said. Parents told us they found it very dficult to get children to do the work children told us they were afraid of being found out.One nine-year-old boy told me, #I don#t want to do school work with my parents because they think I#m really smart and they#re going to find out I#m not - I get good marks because I cheat and copy and when they see I can#t do the work they#re going to know#. This was a common fear for children - a sense of discomfort as school invaded their homes and family relationships. Most children like to keep school and home separate. Parents felt exposed and vulnerable as they were unable to understand or support their children#s learning.Many couldn#t access ICT equipment or provide internet access for multiple children and this led to frustration. She continued: We have lived through a global pandemic, a moment in history unprecedented in modern society. Families I have worked with have all moved through paralysing fear, powerlessness and panic. They have taken a fresh look at what makes them happy, what is worth fighting for - we all realised it#s not toilet roll - and how far they have sleepwalked into a le they wouldn#t have consciously chosen, and don#t really want to go back to. I believe the legacy and consequences of lockdown will be signicant for everyone both in the immediate future and for many years to come.She said there are a number of steps parents can take in the coming weeks and months to ensure their children cope with theto school, including drawing upon the relationships that were built during lockdown and ensuring children#s voices are heard. She also recommended putting in place routines and precautions to ensure everyone feels safe: Then you can stop worrying. Our worries communicate to children - when you feel confident and optimistic, they will too.

The appointment was announced by the Secretary of State Brandon Lewis, with the appointment expected to last three years. It#s after the New Decade, New Approach agreement included a Government commitment to appoint a Northern Ireland Veterans# Commissioner. Mr Kinahan will act as an independent point of contact to support and enhance outcomes for veterans in Northern Ireland.He said he looks forward to setting up his office and providing a strong voice for some , veterans here. We all too often just remember their service in Afghanistan, Iraq, and our own Troubles, but forget about their work in other fields: tackling Ebola in Africa, the protection of shipping in the Gulf, the control and rescue of migrants, as well as the work done by them in African game parks protecting wildle from poachers, he said. Our Armed Forces are active in numerous countries throughout the world offering advice, help and training, often putting their lives at risk so that we all can enjoy ours. We should be proud of them and recognise their skills and the sacrices they and their families have made. We should welcome them back into society when they retire, ensure they are not forgotten are not put at any disadvantage. When they need help it should be there for them immediately.My role as Veterans’ Commissioner is to ensure that this is the case and that coordinated and effective delivery exists for all those who have served. I look forward to ensuring that this is so, he said. Ulster Unionist Party Leader Steve Aiken welcomed the appointment of Mr Kinahan, a former veteran himself. The announcement that Danny Kinahan has been selected as the new Veterans# Commissioner for Northern Ireland will be warmly welcomed by all veterans and the wider armed forces community across all of Northern Ireland. Danny has been steadfast throughout his long political career in fighting to see that our military personnel and their families are given the full recognition that they need and deserve. He will be a first-rate advocate for the many thousands here who have served and by his appointment, we have at long last, joined the rest of the United Kingdom in providing that very necessary representation.Mr Aiken said the appointment was a loss for the UUP as a party. As an elected representative for South Antrim he has served all of his constituents well in Council, the Assembly and in Westminster. As he steps down from all political involvement, we as a Party and I as Leader, wish him all the best in his new and vital role.”Alderman Mark Cosgrove added: Be under no illusions that although Danny has crafted a political career based on building consensus, cross community working and advocating the benefits of the Union, he is a man who beneath it all is a tough negotiator who will always do whatever it takes to deliver for the people he represents. The veterans to whom we all owe so much could not have a better advocate than Danny who will use his decades of experience in this sector to deliver on the many important challenges they face.Belfast Most ReadLet there be light: Derelict Belfast church transformed into heavenly homesDetectives investigating Belfast bonfire attacks on police release images of inidualsCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Wet pubs to remain closed after virus spikeTyrone footballer wins £k on National Lottery scratchcardEamonn Holmes faces criticism over #Rule Britannia# slavery debate,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I had to find a diamond to win and, for some reason, I thought the card wasn’t a winner at first. But then I saw the diamond.“I genuinely couldn’t believe what I was seeing. I didn’t say a word. I just sat there staring at the scratchcard and I went as white as a sheet – so much so that my friends were asking what was wrong. Without speaking, I showed them the card so they could see for themselves.“Nobody could believe it. A couple of the guys actually thought it was a prank with a fake card – but one guy knew that I’d bought it and confirmed that it was legit.Corey continued: “So, after some socially-distanced cheering and jumping about, I called my aunt Edel to break the news and my mum who lives in Scotland. I must admit that emotion got the better of me and I cried my eyes out as I told them what had happened. They couldn’t believe it either.“Then I went home after about an hour, called the number on the back of the scratchcard and confirmed everything with a lovely lady on the end of the phone at the National Lottery Line.”That night Corey was still trying to process it all.He said: “I was so restless and I sat on the edge of the bed most of the night until I finally fell asleep. I woke up a couple of hours later wonderingit was all a dream and then checked where I had hidden the card and was delighted to see that it was still there. It was like this for the next few days and I’m still trying to process it all.”But what does he want to spend his winnings on “I want to spend it wisely, so I’ll probably buy a new car and invest in some property. There are a couple of houses on the market that I have my eye on.“I’d also like to go on holiday when it’s safe to do so and, as a big Manchester United fan, a trip or two to Old Trafford will hopefully be on the cards when sporting events are open to the public again.“The new PlayStation  will be out soon so I’ll buy one of those as well and a few games to keep me going,” continued Corey.“In the meantime, I’ll not do anything too hasty and make sure to sort my family out with a little something. I still can’t believe that I’ve won but it’s a brilliant feeling and I’m very thankful.” Belfast Most ReadLet there be light: Derelict Belfast church transformed into heavenly homesDetectives investigating Belfast bonfire attacks on police release images of inidualsCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Wet pubs to remain closed after virus spikeTyrone footballer wins £k on National Lottery scratchcardEamonn Holmes faces criticism over #Rule Britannia# slavery debate,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The collapse of Stormont coupled with the Department of Health’s view that the school did not demonstrate ‘need and value for money’ led to delays. Finally, in May of this year Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that it had been approved and would open in September . In an in-depth interview with Derry News reporter, Garrett Hargan, Professor Dubras speaks of her elation after discovering the long wait was over, about the hundreds of people who have expressed an interest to date and the wide-ranging benefits that training doctors locally will bring. googletag.cmd.push She also refutes any suggestion that the school will ever be relocated, talks about the prospect of health science courses moving to Magee to complement the medical school and new build projects in the pipeline which will enhance the learning experience for medical students in the city.  For readers who may not know, can you provide a brief background of your career path before taking on the role as Foundation Dean at the Magee Medical School  I’ve been a GP for a long time. My clinical background is that I worked in Southampton looking after homeless people for a long, long time. I was lead GP for a homeless service. googletag.cmd.push From a university perspective, I worked at the University of Southampton for quite a long time and had increasing roles in leadership and ended up running the medical degree programme. I went from there to King’s College in London where I was the Deputy Dean of Medical Education. We were doing a huge curriculum change in this very big medical school, one of the biggest schools in the country with about  students each year. So it was very sizeable and quite a challenge. Then I became the Interim Dean of Medical Education for nine months and then was ready for a new challenge and that’s when this job came up. I arrived in Derry in June . I was really excited about coming here because it was an opportunity to establish something new, obviously with a focus on General Practice. An opportunity to bring my own values to the school and my personal values which have kind of always been about social justice, access and community-based healthcare. It really aligned with the university’s plans. And that’s me in a nutshell. What are your thoughts on the city having lived here for two years now  It’s wonderful, I have felt so welcomed here. I was born and grew up in the Channel Islands, Jersey, and it’s a small community, coastal and I’m kind of used to being in a place where people know other people and I’m used to being somewhere that I can get to the sea. From that perspective I’ve loved it. But I’ve done things like joining Altnagelvin Hospital’s choir, I’m probably the worst member of the choir, but it’s just been lovely and a brilliant way to get to know people. I’ve started running, I joined Star Running Club. Everywhere I’ve gone I’ve been impressed by just how much of a welcoming place the city is. Why did approval for the medical school take so long  It took a little bit longer than I was expecting. But although the journey was a little bit longer and a bit lumpier than I had anticipated, it’s worth it. I think the outcome is a really great one. At this months Western Trust meeting a member of the board said the Department of Health put obstacles in the way. Is that true  No, I don’t think so. It’s been a very thorough process of working with the university to develop our outline business case. And I think the civil service have a responsibility to make sure that these things are robust. At the point where we submitted our final business case to them in October of last year I was confident it was well put together and robust. There was time required for them to consider that. And the Assembly was not in place which was an added dimension to the decision-making process because the civil service aren’t in a position to make that level of decision. So it took longer than any of us expected but with the benefit of hindsight, that was not wasted time. And the GMC process was ongoing in parallel anyway. They visited us in July last year and we did have to pause the process until such time as we had confirmation of student places. But once we resumed the process we were able to pick that up fairly quickly. A little bit longer but I wouldn’t say there was deliberate obstruction at all. How did you feel when it finally got over the line  Oh goodness, delighted. The announcement by the Deputy First Minister in May of our places was just so welcome and then the confirmation that we had by the end of June was equally, each step has been fantastic. But the one that made me feel most excited was the point where the GMC gave agreement that we could recruit staff and students. That was the most signicant for me when our external regulator said it was happy for us to progress. There is some fear in the city, which has been highlighted by local councillors, that the school could be moved given the history of courses being transferred to other campuses. Are there any guarantees that the medical school will not be moved to another campus  I don’t think there’s any question about that, Garrett. How many applications have you received so far for the course  They all go through UCAS and we don’t know how that is going until ious UCAS deadlines are passed. This morning we had the first of a series of webinars with people who are interested in studying with us. We had  people on this morning wanting to know about the programme. We’re running a test centre for The Graduate Medical School Admissions Testand we filled up our places within a week. There is a real interest in coming to study with us. Has a date been set for the GAMSAT  There are two opportunities, one is usually September and the other March. We became registered as a GAMSAT centre as soon as we got the go-ahead to recruit students. Because it’s an Australian company that runs GAMSAT, it’s the kind of gold standard for anyone going in to graduate entry medical school courses. Our September October sittings are full and they will release the dates for March and as soon as those are released people will be able to register. But in order to apply, people don’t have to have taken GAMSAT in those dates. There’s a two-year grace sosomeone did it in  they would still be eligible for our first round of applications. You’ve pointed out that it is not a post-graduate course or limited to people with medical qualications, but open to anyone with a : degree. What fields have applicants come from so far  The beauty of our programme is that we don’t limit it to people with bioscience backgrounds. My experience working with students on other GEMS courses and also the experience of our partner medical school, St George’s in London, is that there’s a real mix of prior backgrounds. You might have people coming in who’ve got Masters of even PhDs in biomedical related subjects but equally I’ve worked with people who’ve come in with degrees in music, who’ve been geography teachers, lawyers, and the interesting thing about graduate entry medicine is that we teach it students work in mixed groups so you’ll find you might have somebody with an English degree working with someone who has a Masters in mechanical engineering or a BSc in biomedical sciences and actually they all learn from each other and are all engaged in that journey. And the people who are non-bioscience in background learn fast and by the end of the first year they are all at the same level and all really benefited from that ersity in backgrounds. At this stage would you know anything about the geographical spread of applicants  We have a database of about  people who have been interested in following the programme and have probably been in contact with us for about three years. They’re fairly widely dispersed, quite a lot of them are from NI and spread out here. Some expressing interest from GB and other international students but there’s a limit to the number of international students any medical school can take. That’s set by the UK government because of the way clinical placements are funded and also going into the foundation programme to become fully registered with the GMC. There’s a cap on medical courses partly because of what it costs to train doctors but in addition to that it’s about the capacity of hospitals and general practices to take those students. We’ve got lots of interest but limited to what we can do internationally. What specic facilities do you need in order to provide the type of first-class course you envisage  We have a building identied for refurbishment. We will have students on campus for their first year and part of their second year. After that they’re largely out on clinical placements and coming back to campus for certain weeks, tutorials and so on. The estate plan is comprehensive to accommodate those students and we’ll be providing them with a range of resources rooms for learning anatomy, for learning clinical skills, communication skills as well as standard tutorial rooms. Do you have those in the current buildings at Magee  Absolutely. Is the aim to still have a new building along the riverfront   Absolutely yeah, we still intend to have our new building but we have the wherewithal and are ready for first intake on the campus.  Would the theory element of the course be taught there once it’s ready  That would be the expectation, yes. Is there any timeline that you’re aware of for that  As you know, the funding for that is within the City Deal process so there will be the standard contractual stuff that will go on. But we have space on the campus to not be pressured for time and ultimately our new build has to be right. It’s not like we’re going to have to move out within a particular timescale. Seventy students have been agreed to begin with a view to increasing that to . Are you confident it will be increased to  and in what timescale are you looking for that to happen  There are ongoing discussions with the Department for the Economy. In our business case we had a sense of how we want to grow year on year but we’re certainly happy to be delivering  doctors a year because that is a substantial addition to the Northern Ireland medical workforce. Does Ulster University have enough experience and expertise to supervise the medical school at council level  One hundred per cent, absolutely. You’ve heard us talk about the rigorous GMC quality assurance process and a lot of that process is about testing out with us, in a very robust way, a whole range of things that include senior level governance, support, commitment, resources so the GMC wouldn’t be permitting us to progressthey weren’t confident in the university’s ability to deliver this. Can you say anything about the plans for on-site teaching facilities at Altnagelvin that were mentioned at the recent Western Trust board meeting  We’re at an early stage of those conversations and obviously we’re working in a partnership with the Trust and we’ll be having conversations with them and with our colleagues at Queens University Belfast. So it’s early days yet with that. Were these plans included in a business case that has already been submitted  Oh yes, it’s costed. Absolutely. Was it with the department of health because a number of departments have said they have no knowledge of it  I can’t remember the details about which department, it was included in the capital requirements within the City Deal. Should health science coursesmove to Magee to complement the medical school and build upon that positive progress, and would you like to see them come  As you know there’s been a consultation on the future location of those courses which has been paused because we’re running a full equality impact assessment. So we’re aiming to resume that shortly. I think from an educational perspective, the more health professionals you are able to educate in the same place the better. Do you think the medical school approval will aid that case  I think it’s a signicant element. Are you confident it will happen and are you personally pushing for that move  It’s subject to consultation, Garrett, so I can’t pre-judge the outcome of a consultation. But you’ve read the consultation document so you know that that’s the university’s preferred outcome . What do you think about a cross-border university named in honour of John Hume that would link UU Magee, the Institute of Technology in Letterkenny  Sligo and North West Regional College   It has been proposed by the Irish government’s Higher Education minister, is that something you’d be supportive of  I think we have to recognise the impact of John Hume as a politician, peace maker and honorary graduate of the university. So John Hume had immense impact and I think we are very keen to work with the Hume Foundation to recognise his contribution in whatever way is most appropriate. And of course, as you know, his daughter is a GP locally so I think commitment to health and social justice are all things which align very much with my own personal values. We have a very strong working relationship with our colleagues at the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, with North West Regional College, so I think from my perspective, the university is going to continue to deepen those working relationships. Student numbers have dropped at Magee every year since. Does the university have to show that it is committed to the campus by delivering on long-promised expansion to , students  I think the mere fact that the university is committed to the school of medicine and training of doctors in the city is evidence of its commitment. Are you aware of a wider strategy to deliver on that promise  I don’t think there’s any doubt about the university’s commitment to the city, as I said, certainly in terms of training doctors, we’ve already talked about the university’s preferred outcome for the health sciences consultation so I think there’s absolutely no doubt about the university’s commitment. Id imagine you have a busy year ahead, what has to be done to ready the school for students in the coming months  As you can see from the university’s marketing material and my tweets and so on you’ll see that we’re actively marketing to recruit students. And we’ll continue that with webinars, we’ll be running the GAMSAT test in October, we aim to run our interviews in JanuaryFebruary of next year whether they are in person or virtual because of COVID. That will be us progressing student recruitment. Then there is staff recruitment which is due to go out in the next week or so. We have a recruitment strategy to get all of those people in post in time for the first students. There’s the building refurbishment, there’s procurement of our virtual learning environment and ious other bits and pieces. So, you’re right, there is plenty to keep us out of mischief. Looking to the future, what will the course bring to the city, and ultimately when these students are able to graduate, how much will that mean to local health care  My goodness, there are so many benefits. One is that we know from really good research over time thatyou train doctors locally they stay local. And will often choose general practice as a career. What it can do for the city first and foremost is, it will grow our health profession workforce. Second is, there is also a huge opportunity to improve morale amongst the workforce who are currently here because they can see real benefit in brining on the future. There’s nothing more exciting than actually working with medical students because they’re amazing people and you know that they’re going to make brilliant doctors. The third thing is that there’s a real opportunity to improve recruitment anyway, because people like to come to places that are involved in medical education. And another benefit is the fact that medical students don’t just stay in their university, they like to get involved with the local community through classes and societies, so they will often run resuscitation training courses for kids in schools, they might work with a range of community groups doing volunteering. So I think everywhere you turn you would see real benefits to the school the medicine and these students in the city.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is not the first time he faced a challenge in that part of Ulster. He tells Liam Tunney his gripping story, outlining his reasons for wanting to break the stigma of addictionA County Derry man has spoken of his experience with addiction as he prepares for a fundraising challenge in aid of the organisation who helped him deal with it. Dean Groogan, from Ballinascreen, is raising money for the Cuan Mhuire rehabilitation centre in Newry by climbing the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains this weekend with a number of friends. The -year-old, well-known in south Derry for his story-telling and recitation talent, has spoken about his story to encourage others who may be struggling to seek the help they need. “I know a lot of people that need help, but they dont know where to get it or how to go about it,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I wasnt originally going to talk about myself, but I was talking to my girlfriend and people close to me and they said, why are you beating about the bush  “They saidI wanted to break the stigma, I had to be straight and honest, and it made sense. The more I tell my story, itll help people come forward and get help themselves.” Dean had been struggling with drug addiction for a number of years before attending the Newry rehabilitation centre, and says the continued fight to cover up his problems took its toll. “For a lot of years I was struggling. I can make all the excuses in the world about mental health problems, anxiety, depression and guilt, but I got deep into addiction with fake highs,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “I was covering up for a lot of years. I can wear a hundred and one masks and people would think I was in great form, but deep down I was a broken person. “I was hiding that for a long time and I tried a thousand times to get myself sorted, but I would not do it on my own. “It was put to me a few times about getting residential help, but I didnt want it, because it was a pride thing for me. I was embarrassed people would find out. “Eventually I had to put my hands up and say I needed help. I didnt lose my job or my family, so it wasnt rock bottom that way, but emotionally, I was at rock bottom. “I didnt know where to go, I was just a broken person in the depths of depression. Just a broken man. I had to get help and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” Dean and Pat McGinn met up a few weeks ago to record a video about Cuan Mhuire. Dean was introduced to Pat McGinn, a former Lord Mayor of Newry and someone who had been through Cuan Mhuire previously. He admits though, thatit wasnt for the intervention of his girlfriend Emma, and close family and friends, he might not have taken that step. “Cuan Mhuire saved my le, andit hadnt been for my girlfriend Emma and my close family and friends, I wouldnt have gone,” he said. “I wont say Cuan Mhuire did it all for me, because they dont just put a magic wand over your head and say thats you free, because you have to put in the work yourself. “I went in and gave it my all and Cuan Mhuire gave me three months to get my head sorted, myself straight, allowed me to recharge the batteries and I came out a dferent man.” Cuan Mhuire was set up in  by Sister Consilio in Athy, County Kildare. The Newry centre was built in  and originally catered for those suffering from alcohol addiction. These days, the spectrum of addiction is much wider. “In this day and age, its not as simple as a man lying drunk in the street. Drugs are everywhere, in every bar you go into, and its so easy for a young person to get hooked on something,” said Dean. “They try it for a bit of craic and the next thing they know, its a few months down the line and theyre in something they cant get out of. It destroys lives. “Drugs are a new thing, people dont really understand. I was speaking to a man who was drinking for years. He said he never touched drugs, butthey had been about in his day he probably would have. “Its so easily available these days and it wrecks families. It rips the soul clean out of you. For me, I detested myself. I knew what I was doing was wrong and that it was wrecking my le. “I just couldnt stop. Addiction is something that you cant get enough of, but that you detest. It was just ruining me and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” The Cuan Mhuire centre in Newry. On Saturday, August , Dean and a group of friends will climb the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains to raise money for the centre. They are already well on the way to their pound, target, and are hoping the trip will be a fun way of raising money and awareness for Cuan Mhuire. “Eight of us are going to start off at six in the morning and tackle the highest peaks in the Mournes,” said the Ballinascreen native. “I know a few boys that have done it in around  or  hours, but were not going to break any records! There are a few men going to meet us halfway up and do us a barbeque, so itll be a days craic as well. “I know money donated to the charity is great, but stigma is the main thing, so Ill be pushing online about the residential care for people suffering with drugs, gambling or drink.” Dean wants to ensure that anyone who finds themselves in need of help knows where to access it, and is especially keen to help men who may be struggling and reluctant to act. “As men, we bottle a lot of things up, personal things like depression or anxiety and people turn to drink or drugs or other highs to mask them things,” he said. “They are taught from no age not to show any emotions, to bottle it up and be a man, and thats not the reality. Theyre turning to other substances to mask the pain and thats just not the way to go. “This is to let them know that places like Cuan Mhuire are out there and will help themthey come forward. “Anything can go through that door thats one thing I found out about it. There are all dferent age groups and all dferent backgrounds and religions. “There are people with plenty of money and people with none. There were even a few people who were homeless whose families want nothing to do with them. “Addiction doesnt care who you are, it will come for you regardless. Putting yourself out there warts and all isnt easy, butit helps someone, thats the reason for doing it.” For more information, visit the Mourne Mountain Challenge Facebook page, where you can find links to the Just Giving page, for those wishing to donate.

He tells Liam Tunney his gripping story, outlining his reasons for wanting to break the stigma of addictionA County Derry man has spoken of his experience with addiction as he prepares for a fundraising challenge in aid of the organisation who helped him deal with it. Dean Groogan, from Ballinascreen, is raising money for the Cuan Mhuire rehabilitation centre in Newry by climbing the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains this weekend with a number of friends. The -year-old, well-known in south Derry for his story-telling and recitation talent, has spoken about his story to encourage others who may be struggling to seek the help they need. “I know a lot of people that need help, but they dont know where to get it or how to go about it,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I wasnt originally going to talk about myself, but I was talking to my girlfriend and people close to me and they said, why are you beating about the bush  “They saidI wanted to break the stigma, I had to be straight and honest, and it made sense.

They are already well on the way to their pound, target, and are hoping the trip will be a fun way of raising money and awareness for Cuan Mhuire. “Eight of us are going to start off at six in the morning and tackle the highest peaks in the Mournes,” said the Ballinascreen native. “I know a few boys that have done it in around  or  hours, but were not going to break any records! There are a few men going to meet us halfway up and do us a barbeque, so itll be a days craic as well. “I know money donated to the charity is great, but stigma is the main thing, so Ill be pushing online about the residential care for people suffering with drugs, gambling or drink.” Dean wants to ensure that anyone who finds themselves in need of help knows where to access it, and is especially keen to help men who may be struggling and reluctant to act. “As men, we bottle a lot of things up, personal things like depression or anxiety and people turn to drink or drugs or other highs to mask them things,” he said. “They are taught from no age not to show any emotions, to bottle it up and be a man, and thats not the reality. Theyre turning to other substances to mask the pain and thats just not the way to go. “This is to let them know that places like Cuan Mhuire are out there and will help themthey come forward. “Anything can go through that door thats one thing I found out about it. There are all dferent age groups and all dferent backgrounds and religions. “There are people with plenty of money and people with none. There were even a few people who were homeless whose families want nothing to do with them. “Addiction doesnt care who you are, it will come for you regardless. Putting yourself out there warts and all isnt easy, butit helps someone, thats the reason for doing it.” For more information, visit the Mourne Mountain Challenge Facebook page, where you can find links to the Just Giving page, for those wishing to donate. Anyone who is in need of help or support with addiction can contact Cuan Mhuire by phone on  or via email – newry@cuanmhuire.ie  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Jeananne Craig worked in the English capital and Dublin for more than a decade, reporting on breaking news and showbiz red carpets.  But after the birth of her second child in , the Rosemount woman decided to relocate to the city where she grew up. “I had a great time in London and some amazing experiences there, but like many Derry people living away from home, I always missed it,” Jeananne said. “We moved to Derry a year and a half ago and are so happy to be here, particularly in the last six months, when having a bit more space and being close to family and nature has been so important.” googletag.cmd.push With a growing trend for people looking to leave built-up cities for quieter, more affordable locations post-lockdown, Jeananne decided to share her experience and that of other ‘city quitters’ in a podcast. All Change Please is co-hosted by Jeananne, who now works as a freelance journalist and copywriter, and her friend and fellow journalist, Jayne Cherrington-Cook, who left London for Kent. They release new episodes fortnightly and interviewees in series one include s music royalty-turned-designer Pearl Lowe, who moved from London to Somerset, Irish presenter and illustrator Maggie Molloy, and original Big Brother winner Craig Phillips, who reveals he once rented a room from the shows notorious Nasty Nick. googletag.cmd.push We cover all sorts of topics, from the practicalities of moving, to working from home and making friends somewhere new - and whether people have any regrets about leaving a big city, said Jeananne. Its all done remotely with Jayne in Kent, me in Derry and our guest joining from wherever theyre based. I actually have to record in my parents house, my own is too noisy with two young children running around and wanting to join in, said Jeananne who, plans to include some well-known local names soon.The logo for All Change Please was designed by local artist Bronach Crabtee, aka The Crafty Crab. The plan is to attract listeners considering a move, but I think our interviewees have such interesting stories to tell, it will make a good listen for anyone looking for a new podcast to enjoy, Jeananne added. The first two episodes of All Change Please are online now, with new episodes released fortnightly on a Thursday. The podcast is available on iTunes, Spoty and Acast, and is on Twitter @allchangepod https:podcasts.apple gb podcast all-change-please id  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Micky Doherty was presented with the Foyle Pride Mark Ashton Award for Outstanding Contribution to the LGBTQ+ community by the citys real Mayor, SDLP Councillor Brian Tierney, at a ceremony at the Holywell Trusts Garden of Remembrance on Saturday night. A spokesperson for Foyle Pride said Mr Doherty, who fronts the citys Pride parade each year, was a truly deserving winner who does so much, for not only the LGBTQ+ community, but also the wider city and district community. Mr Doherty is a tireless charity fundraiser and helped set up a special fund to help local people in need during the oronavirus crisis. googletag.cmd.push Im known in the local area as being a charity fundraiser-theres a charity fundraiser Ill host it, said Mr Doherty. Its just part of me that I like helping people. During lockdown I knew people had started to struggle and they were coming to me and I started to think about how I could help. Because I have been working with charities for a long time people put their trust in me. Mr Doherty was hosting a drive through bingo event last week when he got a phone call to say he had won the Foyle Pride award. I just burst out crying, he admitted. I really didnt expect it so I was just overwhelmed. googletag.cmd.push I just have so much gratitude for the award and for everyone who nominated me and I want to thank them all. Mr Doherty said he wished his late mum, Cathy, could have been there on Saturday to see him receive his award. Its hard to accept that my mammy couldnt be there, he said. Its just not the same without her but I am still filled with so much gratitude for it, he said. Derry LGBT+ campaigner, Suzanna Toland, who passed away earlier this year, was remembered at Saturdays ceremony. It was really nice to see Suzanna recognised for everything that she did, said Micky. She was a very special person.Before she passed away she had set up an LGBT+ disco at Rosie Joes so that people would have a safe place to socialise.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The guidance, announced this evening by Peter Weir, comes into effect from August . The Minister said: “My key priority is that pupilsto school on a full-time basis, as soon as it is safe to do so. “Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time. googletag.cmd.push ”This updates the existing guidance on the use of face coverings in educational settings. “The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits, however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. “It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings. “My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. “In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so. googletag.cmd.push “In relationto communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible.  “Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. “However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. “Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings. “I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice. Peter Weir added: “The first step in keeping our schools safe is that anyone with symptoms should not attend school. Parents should not send their children to schoolthey have any of the Covid- symptoms including: a high temperaturea new, continuous cougha loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Next month, he will be begin to study Sports Psychology at Liverpool John Moores University, with the long-term goal of helping special needs athletes prepare mentally and phsyically for sport. “The College teams up with local sporting organisations, giving us the option of volunteering with them,” said Oisiacuten, who plays Gaelic Football for St Martins GAC in Desertmartin. googletag.cmd.push “This gives me the opportunity to work with some fantastic groups, including Magherafelt Marvels Special Olympics Clubs and Peace Players which promotes ersity through sport. “The practical sessions could sometimes push you out of your comfort zone which was always a good learning experience.” Oisiacutens was awarded the Inspirational Student of the Year award at the end of his first year at the College and while lockdown put sport on hold, he continued to volunteer with Magherafelt Marvels. “Volunteering with the Special Olypmics has given me greater confidence in my own ability and reinforced the importance of giving clear instructions and listering to others,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “We kept in touch and posted home videos on Facebook so the athletes could continue their training at home during the lockdown.” Bronagh ONeill, Sports lecturer at Northern Regional College, said she was delighted with Oisiacutens success. “Oisin was a pleasure to have in the class and the accolade ‘Inspirational Student of the Year’ was so well deserved,” she said. “He was quite shy when he started the course, so it was great to watch him progress and grow in confidence. “He really benefited from volunteering with the Magherafelt Marvels but they have also benefited from his expertise and enthusiasm. I wish him every success at university and in his future career.“ Northern Regional College offers a range of full-time and part-time Sports courses.

It is understood that the mystery vessel was bought for pound with the unknown owner planning to convert it into an Airbnb boat.  Foyle Search and Rescue , the police and other relevant agencies responded to reports of the boat being stuck on Sunday when they offered the crew assistance. The vessel, Day Dawn N , was last known to be engaged in fishing. according to the Marine Traffic website. Another site, Vessel Finder, also states that it received the latest position of the boat at .pm on August . googletag.cmd.push FSR were tasked on Sunday last, following reports of a grounded vessel. Pat Carlin, of FSR, said the boat was likely to be there until mid-September when the tide would be high enough for it to re-float. “She’s stuck solid,” he added. “We went and assessed the boat, determined that the crew were safe and passed that information on to the police service,” Mr Carlin explained “We provided them with some basic supplies that they needed and basically the vessel is grounded and can’t be move until the tide is lted. “All relevant services were notied and are aware that it’s there.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Carlin continued: “I think they were up on the council pontoon and to the best of my knowledge they may have come from outside the area, I don’t know exactly. “They’ll have no choice but to wait, maybe with the sudden floods tonightthey’ll be lucky and might get re-floated otherwise they’ll have to wait until the tides are high enough.” The PSNI confirmed that police assisted partners, including FSR and Coastguard in liaising with the crew. A report from , shows that Day Dawn N  was bought for the purposes of fishing from Portavogie. It was said to be the first time the vessel had been based anywhere  apart from Kilkeel since her arrival in  from Banff where the wooden-hulled boat was built by John Watt  Sons as a trawler. Harbour master at Portavogie, Neil Warnock, yesterday said Day Dawn was based there but left a couple of months ago. “Somebody bought it for a pleasure craft,” he explained. “It’s not a fishing boat any more, the licence on it was sold off a while ago there. “The last I heard the boat was in Portrush, I saw a picture of it at Portrush harbour after it left here.” At Portrush, the assistant harbour master said the boat owner was only there for three days and he believed the man travelled from the Greencastle direction. He was trying to get himself a permanent mooring, he said, but wasn’t able to secure it. The owner left Portrush heading towards Derry where he tried to get a mooring in the town and ended up on the mud flats. “I just know that he bought that for pound. None of the fishermen like decommissioning so they basically would rather they go off. “So I think he bought it for a pound and wanted to change it into an Air B ‘n’ B, but we couldn’t offer him a permanent mooring in Portrush, so he was only here for three days,” the Assistant Harbour Master added. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Foyle Port added: “Foyle Port is aware that a small trawler has run aground at Madams Bank in the River Foyle. “There is no environmental threat or impediment to other marine craft. “Once conditions are right we expect the vessel to become buoyant again.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Another site, Vessel Finder, also states that it received the latest position of the boat at .pm on August . googletag.cmd.push FSR were tasked on Sunday last, following reports of a grounded vessel. Pat Carlin, of FSR, said the boat was likely to be there until mid-September when the tide would be high enough for it to re-float. “She’s stuck solid,” he added. “We went and assessed the boat, determined that the crew were safe and passed that information on to the police service,” Mr Carlin explained “We provided them with some basic supplies that they needed and basically the vessel is grounded and can’t be move until the tide is lted. “All relevant services were notied and are aware that it’s there.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Carlin continued: “I think they were up on the council pontoon and to the best of my knowledge they may have come from outside the area, I don’t know exactly. “They’ll have no choice but to wait, maybe with the sudden floods tonightthey’ll be lucky and might get re-floated otherwise they’ll have to wait until the tides are high enough.” The PSNI confirmed that police assisted partners, including FSR and Coastguard in liaising with the crew. A report from , shows that Day Dawn N  was bought for the purposes of fishing from Portavogie. It was said to be the first time the vessel had been based anywhere  apart from Kilkeel since her arrival in  from Banff where the wooden-hulled boat was built by John Watt  Sons as a trawler. Harbour master at Portavogie, Neil Warnock, yesterday said Day Dawn was based there but left a couple of months ago. “Somebody bought it for a pleasure craft,” he explained. “It’s not a fishing boat any more, the licence on it was sold off a while ago there. “The last I heard the boat was in Portrush, I saw a picture of it at Portrush harbour after it left here.” At Portrush, the assistant harbour master said the boat owner was only there for three days and he believed the man travelled from the Greencastle direction. He was trying to get himself a permanent mooring, he said, but wasn’t able to secure it. The owner left Portrush heading towards Derry where he tried to get a mooring in the town and ended up on the mud flats. “I just know that he bought that for pound. None of the fishermen like decommissioning so they basically would rather they go off. “So I think he bought it for a pound and wanted to change it into an Air B ‘n’ B, but we couldn’t offer him a permanent mooring in Portrush, so he was only here for three days,” the Assistant Harbour Master added. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Foyle Port added: “Foyle Port is aware that a small trawler has run aground at Madams Bank in the River Foyle. “There is no environmental threat or impediment to other marine craft. “Once conditions are right we expect the vessel to become buoyant again.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He took trains from Milan to Torino, and then up the Susa Valley and around six hours later he was installed in Susa where it was  degrees.Race day dawned without a cloud in the sky and with the temperature already soaring, Hanna joined the front row of the grid designed for social distancing wearing his mask. The mask was obligatory for the first m. Hanna tucked into a front bunch that was a whorsquos who of Italian mountain racing. Hanna covered the first mile in :, and then at km the race became steep.

He caught Baldaccini and kept pushing and on to the final k, with  flats and true flats at over , feet altitude, Hanna surged to cross the line in a brilliant eighth place.In the process he had taken the scalps of, not just the former winner of the race Baldaccini, but also Puppi, who had taken second place in last yearrsquos World Long-Distance Mountain Racing Championships, and Bernard Dematteis, the former European mountain racing champion.At Down Royal on Saturday, the sound of hi-tec racing flats reverberated around the horse racing turf as the ChampionChip Ireland Road Race Series continued following its event at Eikon, Balmoral, three weeks ago.It was only August , but could easily have been mistaken for late autumn as the blustery conditions from the remnants of tropical Storm Ellen continued to cause havoc in the quest for personal bests.It was a testament to the consistent running many had done during lockdown and throughout the winter before that there were many personal bests achieved.First up was the km, won by Mourne man Andrew Annett in : in a sprint finish with Annadalersquos Eskander Turki .

At that stage, Bryansford had work to do with Clonduff leading - to -.Charlie Carr split the posts for Clonduff with a superbly taken score. Aidan Carr also got in on the act scoring a minor from play and Stephen McConville got his name on the scoresheet.Aidan Carr added another point and on  minutes the lead was extended further when Arthur McConville landed a big free to make it - to -.Bryansford needed something to steady the ship and they managed it on  minutes, getting their first score on the board when a free from Cathal Burns cut the gap to four points.Clonduff, however, were in no mood to get a case of the jitters and indeed stretched their lead to - to - when, in the th minute, firstly Tom Close got the better of his marker to break free to land another score, and then moments later, Barry OrsquoHagan did likewise.Bryansford were in need of some kind of encouragement and Danny Savage provided it on  minutes when he landed a free.Darren OrsquoHagan however went up the field and confidently steered between the posts to put Clonduff - to - ahead at the half-time interval.Early in the second period, Clonduff kept the foot on the gas to flatten the Bryansford spirit even more.Paddy Brannigan engineered just enough space for himself to punt the ball over Mark Reidrsquos crossbar.And then on  minutes it was - to - when Aidan Carr capitalised on space in the lsquoFord defence to leave Clonduff in the box seat.Clonduff were finding space more and more easy to come by and from a free after five minutes Stephen McConville made it - to -.Bryansford remained honest in the battle and made their third impression on the scoreboard when David McKenna pointed on  minutes.Clonduffrsquos machine was starting to purr productively and they rolled the scoreboard over once more ten minutes after the resumption when Stephen McConville knocked the ball over from play.The sides swapped scores on the -minute mark of the contest when David McKibbin made another minor from a free for lsquoFord, but Stephen McConville pointed for Clonduff to make it - to -.Fintan Canavan scored Bryansfordrsquos fth point before Stephen McConville responded in kind to again leave a nine-point cushion between them.The final minor before the next water break though went the way of Bryansford, Timmy Hanna notching it to make it - to -.In the th minute of the contest, Cathal Burns pointed Bryansfordrsquos seventh point.

That set up something of a tense finish to the contest when it had looked like it would be anything but.Twenty four minutes into the second half, Savage again was the commander-in-chief of the counter-offensive, making it three points in a row for Bryansford to cut the scoreline to - to -.A free gave Bryansford and Savage the chance to leave just a goal between the sides, and he made no mistakes, confidently floating his effort between the sticks, continuing his spell as a one-man danger to Clonduffrsquos superiority.However, as the clock began to become the enemy of lsquoFord, Clonduffrsquos Tom Close pointed from play to give Clonduff that crucial lead of four ahead again.Cathal Burns curled a neat point over the bar for Bryansford going into injury time to make it - to -.Then came a moment to stun Clonduff when Bryansford found a goal.

Like Pantridge, after the war he could neither forgive nor forget and had a burning hatred of the Japanese.During his time in captivity, Pantridge suffered badly from malnutrition, beri beri and other illnesses. Following the Japanese surrender he weighed less than five stone and was a physical wreck.On ing home to Northern Ireland in October  he was still very weak, but was determined to resume his medical career, getting a housemanrsquos position at the Royal Victoria Hospital.Because of his experiences in the POW camps, he decided to specialise in heart medicine. He became a consultant physician and cardiologist at the RVH before inventing the portable defibrillator in the s.Pantridge had become convinced that a patient might be savedan electric shock was applied to the chest as soon as possible after a cardiac arrest. There were defibrillators in hospitals, but they were too big and bulky to be taken outside.Along with others he set out to make a defibrillator small enough to fit inside an ambulance. In  the first ambulance with a defibrillator was operating in Northern Ireland, making the province one of the safest places in the world to have a heart attack.The mobile defibrillator was used to treat US President Lyndon Johnson when he suffered a heart attack in .Although he was known worldwide as the lsquoFather of Emergency Medicinersquo Pantridge was less acclaimed in his own country, and was saddened that it took until  for all front-line ambulances in the UK to be fitted with defibrillators.He had retired in  and died on December , , aged . A bronze statue of him stands outside Lisburnrsquos civic centre as a timeless tribute to his achievements.Cecil Lowry says of Professor Pantridge: ldquoFrank was a man, whose talents and achievements were so extraordinary, that the further we consider his character, the more he will be remembered by the present generation with admiration and reverence.ldquoThis book has told the manrsquos story of incredible bravery in the face of overwhelming odds during the Second World War and his dedication to the concept of the portable defibrillator on his . He was part of the lsquoforgotten armyrsquo and more than  years on, with very few still alive, it is a privilege to set the record straight and to honour him.lsquoFrank Pantridge MC, Japanese Prisoner of War and Inventor of the Portable Defibrillatorrsquo is published by Pen  Sword Books Ltd and is priced pound...prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th August 2020 Dedicated.jpg","title":"Dedicated crossings for school children on Strangford ferry  ","story":"DEDICATED sailings for school children are to be introduced on the Strangford ferry service from next week.The Department for Infrastructure will provide a foot passenger only service from either side of the waterway from next Tuesday.Students will cross from Portaferry at .am and from Strangford at pm, with the sailings co-ordinated with Translink to ensure that there are buses to ferry children to and from school.Confirmation of the new service mdash which requires all passengers to wear face masks mdash comes after a number of children were refused permission to board the ferry on Monday morning from the Portaferry side.Only  foot passengers were permitted on the sailing due to coronavirus restrictions which forced children to wait for the vessel to , sparking criticism from Strangford MLA Kellie Armstrong and local councillor Joe Boyle.Mrs Armstrong, who for a number of weeks has highlighted the issue of limited passenger numbers and how students travelling on the ferry would be accommodated, has raised her concerns with Stormont education minister Peter Weir.She said that her fears were confirmed on Monday when only  foot passengers were permitted per sailing which resulted in some students having to miss two subsequent sailings before they could cross the lough, missing buses to Downpatrick.Mrs Armstrong said she was also concerned that children had to wait for up to one hour with little access to shelter, before yesterdayrsquos storm force conditions.ldquoSchoolsat the end of August every year and social distancing has been in place for months.ldquoAnyone with any transport planning ability would have ensured there was a solution, recognising the number needing to cross on the ferry as foot passengers and enabling students to travel safely, she said ahead of yesterdayrsquos confirmation about the new passenger service.ldquoI contacted the Minister for Infrastructure who confirmed weeks ago that her department was waiting on education officials to clary how many students needed to cross and sailing times.In a letter to Mr Weir, the Strangford MLA suggested that officials ldquofailed to meet the start of school deadline and as a result students were not being provided with appropriate home to school transport.Mrs Armstrong said that in the pastthe ferry could not be used, students were bused around the peninsula and asked why this option was not considered.Cllr Boyle said that what happened on Monday morning impacted on students who attend schools in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch.ldquoI simply cannot believe that as we entered the last week in August with Minister Weir trumpeting the importance of ato school that there was little or no advanced preparation or thought for children and parents within the Ards peninsula. The way they have been treated is diabolical, he declared.Cllr Boyle said parents have raised their concerns with him, highlighting what their children experienced at the start of the new school term by having to wait to use the ferry.He also revealed that he became increasingly concerned when he highlighted the issue on social media and was told how children were being treated.Cllr Boyle said problems were compounded with the closure of the main Strangford to Downpatrick road to allow a number of trees to be pruned to allow double decker buses to use the route in future.ldquoMy main concern is that there was no prior notice in relation to the number of children who could board the ferry.

The Minister cannot allow all this to simply be thrown away.The Strangford MLA added: ldquoThe local community previously stood together to save Exploris and will do so again. I would urge anyone with concerns to make their voice heard and lodge their concerns and together we can save our local economy.It is believed that the poundm aquarium proposal could create more than  full-time jobs and would be the biggest attraction of its kind on the island of Ireland.The firm behind it, reefLIVE, says around  to  jobs could be created during its construction, with  full-time

He said the impact of the small building mdash redeveloped by the Parish Church mdash was expanding all the time.He added: ldquoI know that you will protect and encourage all that happens from there.Dean Hull paid tribute to Mr McDonaldrsquos contribution to not only Down and Hollymount churches but all those within the Lecale Area Mission Partnershipgroup.ldquoScott made a signicant contribution to LAMP and he and his family have been very much part of le here in Down and in Hollymount, also touching on the other churches within the group as well.ldquoScottrsquos ministry very much focused on Down Parish and Hollymount but he has influenced people in churches where and there are those who are sad that they cannot be with us this morning, the Dean continued.Praising Mr McDonald for launching Carols by the Lake and Blue Christmas initiatives, Dean Hull said the latter really touched those dealing with bereavement and loss and hopes that bothcontinue to feature on the church calendar.Mr Dorrian highlighted the key role played by Scott in forging relationships, referencing his work with the Pepper Johns Community Centre and establishing a link betweenHollymount Church and Hollymount Pipe Band. One of the bandrsquos members, Sam Gill, played at the end of Sundayrsquos service.Mr Telford described Sundayrsquos service as a ldquosad occasion as the congregation in Down Parish said goodbye to their minister who had touched all their lives.He said Mr McDonaldrsquos arrival in  ldquosparked renewed optimism within the church with the new man quickly making his mark, especially in relation to the Pepper Johns Community Centre which he helped deliver along with the board of trustees.He added: ldquoPerhaps the best tribute that can be paid to Scott is that he very soon became one of us and, deep down, I think he knows that he always will be. It was a hard decision for Scott and his family to make the move to Newry and it is important that while we are disappointed aboutthis, we support them and continue to do so.On behalf of Hollymount Church, Ms Blair said that Mr McDonald will be very much missed, praising him for his leadership and the ious initiatives that he spearheaded over the past four years.ldquoWe are all fond of Scott who was with us through thick and thin and ups and downs. No matter what, Scott was there, she said.Ms Blair added: ldquoWhile we are sorry to see him go, we wish Scott and his family all the best in Newry..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th August 2020 Students.jpg","title":"Students celebrate GCSE results after ‘challenging year’  ","story":"IT was a dferent GCSE results day this year for local schools and students as the need to maintain social distancing measures was a key concern.As with the recent A-Level results, grades this year were predicted by teachers as examinations could not be held due to schools closure over the Covid- lockdown.Down High Schoolrsquos principal, Mrs Maud Perry, reported that  students collected their results from two designated venues in Downpatrick at dferent times with social distancing measures in place.Nearly % of all students achieved at least seven A* A grades while six pupils mdash Katie Dickson, Ellen Johnston, Cameron McCaughey, Lauren McCormick, Rosa Morgan-Young and Anna Torrens mdash all received ten A* grades while Lucy Healy and Tori Marks secured nine A* grades each.Mrs Perry paid tribute to the hard work of her pupils during such challenging times.ldquoThis was a lovely year group and we congratulate them on these outcomes, which provide a firm foundation for the next stage of their education.

Mine are typically borne of the annual one- or two-week childhood summer holidays in the s - staying in a guesthouse, splashing in the sea, building sandcastles, baking in the sun and or sheltering from the rain, roundabout rides in Barry’s amusements - all sustained by a diet of fish and chips, ice-cream, fizzy pop and candy floss! Returning as a working journalist in later le entailed mental gymnastics to temporarily mask the myriad of memories and concentrate on the task in hand!I remember my parents and their adult friends making plans to go shopping in the White House though I’ve no recollection of going with them, and until this week I wasn’t even vaguely aware of the shop’s enormously colourful history.“The White House was opened by a local man, Henry Hamilton, in ,” began a reader’s note to Roamer, and continued intriguingly “the story goes that Henry left Portrush for America in , leaving his clothes at the edge of the River Bann to shamefully fake his own suicide and avoid debts.”I don’t knowthe reader’s thoughts turned to Portrush after reading last week’s page about Wing Commander Anthony Lovell, the town’s much-decorated WWII ace fighter pilot, recounted here by Hugh McGrattan and told in his book - Portrush: The Port on the Promontory - but the White House seems to be yet another remarkable tale less told. There’ll be more here about it in the near future, starting today with the next line in the reader’s letter: “Henry Hamilton became director of a publishing company in Calornia, before ing to Portrush  years later a wealthy man and marrying his former sweetheart.”The reader’s account is more or less correct - the White House was founded in  after Henry Hamilton faked his death due to debts and fled to America. He ed a number of years later to be with his childhood sweetheart, a Miss Allen, whom he married.His new we insisted they stay in Ireland and so the White House was born, initially a drapery business called Hamilton and Company.According to the reader’s account Henry invited the creditors he’d run away from to dinner and repaid his debts. He also called his new business the White House after a well-known building with a similar name in the USA, and to honour the friends and connections he’d made on the other side of the Atlantic. The White House quickly became a successful commercial enterprise due to Hamilton’s business expertise, management skills and marketing talents. Far ahead of his time, he organised a mail order service and instigated eye-catching window displays and advertising campaigns. The mail order service became so popular that a new Post Office was opened in Portrush in !The White House attracted the highest calibre of clientele, with no less than Queen Victoria ordering her linens from the Portrush store.According to its website, the White House’s tailoring department in the early s also proved very popular with the Prince of Wales and with other royalty and high-society customers like His Highness the Raja of Pudukkottai from India. As yet I’m not sure of the exact dates, or which Prince of Wales used the shop’s tailoring department, but apparently the Raja of Pudukkottai once made an order for  suits which was the White House’s biggest ever transaction at the time.Nor do I know how to properly spell or pronounce Pudukkottaibut the Raja’s aforementioned administrative district was in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu and its ruler’s full name was Raja Sri Brahdamba Dasa Raja Sir Martanda Bhairava Tondaiman. Along with the town, the store’s popularity flourished, aided by the railway, sea travel, better roads and burgeoning visitor facilities. A beautul ‘terrazzo floored’ arcade took centre stage, with a state-of-the-art, electric passenger lt inside which was still in use up until a few years agoDuring the s and s the store became popular with American GI’s during WWII, who spent their leisure time in Portrush away from their bases in Londonderry. They loved to visit the White House buying gts to send home to their families.During the s and s the store expanded and continued to flourish with customers not only coming from Northern Ireland but also from England, Wales and Scotland, brought in by tour companies.The business was taken over by John Moore in , and an up-market boutique was launched, targeting the fashion conscious shopper and attracting new and younger customers.In the s major building works were completed which transformed the premises into a modern establishment with the official re-opening to the public taking place in . Ownership of the White House, with pride of place on Portrush’s Main Street, remains within the Moore family who are currently going through their archives to share more seaside shopping nostalgia here in the near future.

DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPoliticsQuestions asked over Lord Mayor’s decisionA Portadown councillor has called on Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council’s Chief Executive and legal team to investigate the Lord Mayor’s interpretation of a standing order.By The NewsroomWednesday, th August , : pm\"\"The call for clarity was made during August’s monthly meeting of Council by DUP councillor, Darryn Causby.It follows a decision made by the Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage, during June’s monthly meeting of Council to rule a motion relating to the naming of the South Lake LeisureCentre ‘improper’ and decide that it would not be debated.During discussion of his decisionon the night, the Lord Mayor made it clear he had not taken legal advice but had discussed his decision with his Sinn Fein party colleagues.Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson also confirmed that he was only made aware of the decision just as the meeting was beginning and as such, legal advice was not produced.Speaking at August’s monthly meeting, Cllr Causby said he believed the Lord Mayor did not have the authority to act as he did and asked for clarication to ensure such actions are not repeated.“I want to raise a point of order Lord Mayor,” said Cllr Causby. “It refers to standing order .. which is the standing order you used when deciding not to allow a motion placed on the agenda for our meeting in June to be heard.“You interpreted the standing order in an interesting way. I have checked and reading through the standing orders I don’t believe you had the authority to do what you did,you read the standing orders in the correct context.“In terms of the standing order it is for the reporting officer to determinea notice of motion is lawful or improper. The Chief Executive is our officer in that regard and he considered the motion and included it in the agenda for the meeting.“You then took the decision, unilaterally, to not have it heard during the meeting.”Councillor Causby asked for the matter to be investigated to clarythe Lord Mayor acted within the bounds of his authority.“My ask is that the Chief Executive and Council’s legal team investigate the eighth edition of’Knowles on Local Authority Meetings’ as it details the proper protocol, it is the guide and case law,” said the DUP representative.“I want to ensure that we get proper clarity to prevent a decision like from being taken again.”Speaking to the Local Democracy Reporting Service after the meeting, Councillor Causby said this call has nothing to do with the decision taken on the naming of the South Lakes Leisure Centre, rather ensuring that the office of the Lord Mayor remains removed from partisan politics.“With regards to the decision taken on the name of the leisure centre, what is done, is done,” said Cllr Causby.“We are not going to overturn that decision, it has already been made. I just want to ensure a moment like this does not happen again.“The standing order the Lord Mayor quoted is ... It concerns motions that are unlawful or improper. The Lord Mayor called the motion improper but that was not his call to make.“Council Baxter should have been informed of the decision prior to the meeting but he was not, nor was the Chief Executive, the Lord Mayor told us on the night he had informed his party colleagues.“He acted outside the process, outside standing orders and, in my view, quite improperly.”When asked about the process of the investigation, a Council spokesperson said “no comment could be made on the matter”.“In line with legislation, a notice of motion is subject to a call-in periodand no comment can be made on the matter until the call-in period has lapsed,” the spokesperson said.“In this case, as legal advice on the interpretation of the standing order is to be provided, it would also be subject to legal privilege.”Read our coverage of the original debate hereA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Over my years as principal, we have had great support from the club and some of our past pupils have gone on to represent their county.For me, the notable achievement has been to see the way in which past pupils have progressed in a iety of chosen careers and been successful in so many walks of le.Another achievement is the way in which the staff both past and present have worked together as a team to have accomplished so many things over the past  years, not least to have been awarded Outstanding in our last inspection report.The development of the St. Cairealls Community Playschool on the school site has also brought me great joy over the past ten years to see it now as a successful pre-school provider with DENI status and funding for our local children.Having spent so many years of my le in St Cairealls P.S., it has become a second home and the staff and pupils a second family. Retiring for me brings mixed emotions. However , I am looking forward to having more time to spend with my family, my husband Kevin, our daughters Emer, Niamh and Fionnuala and their partners. Also our son Michael and his partner and my two precious grandsons Micheal and Braidan. Mrs McHugh concluded: I want to offer good wishes to the future of this very special school – St. Cairealls Primary School, Aghyaran and success and happiness to my successor, Mrs Michelle Ellis.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cdcdbbbccdfd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_febcbddabbfff   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1598431969897.jpg--post_primary_pupils_now_to_wear_face_coverings_in_corridors.jpg?159843197000","title":"post primary pupils now to wear face coverings in corridors ","story":"Education Minister Peter Weir has announced that guidance on face coverings will be updated to include wearing them in corridors of post-primary schools. This will come into effect on  August when schoolson a full-time basis. The Minister said: “My key priority is that pupilsto school on a full-time basis, as soon as it is safe to do so. “Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time. This updates the existing guidance on the use of face coverings in educational settings. “The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits, however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings. “My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so. “In relation to communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible. “Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings. “I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice. Peter Weir said: “The first step in keeping our schools safe is that anyone with symptoms should not attend school. Parents should not send their children to schoolthey have any of the Covid- symptoms including: a high temperature a new, continuous cough a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.” The Department’s New School Day Guidance will be updated to reflect this recommendation.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cdcdbbbccdfd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_febcbddabbfff   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
