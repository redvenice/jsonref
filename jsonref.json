The hippo had been attacking younger animals and needed to be darted to it could be moved out of harms way \u0027The hippo had lacerations and various other wounds due to pod fights some of which were serious as he was a very aggressive hippo that was challenging and injuring many of the other male hippos.\u0027He had already killed two calves hence the decision for a search mission in daylight which is difficult as tranquilising it is not easy as you don\u0027t want the hippo rushing back into the water and drowning.\u0027But he was safely captured and moved by truck to his new home\u0027 he said.Hippo\u0027s can weigh up to 2 tons and this one was estimated to be about 1.5 tons.They are one of the most dangerous animals in Africa and kill an estimated 500 people every year.They were very common in the Western Cape but were exterminated in the region by the 1800\u0027s but the hippo\u0027s at Quila form part of a large pod that was reintroduced to the area nearly 20 years ago. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/16/4D0E263F00000578-5817855-Wide_receiver_Terrell_Owens_81_of_the_Philadelphia_Eagles_runs_p-a-5_1528472335803.jpg","title":"Terrell Owens wont attend Hall Fame induction","story":"    Terrell Owens #81 of the Cincinnati Bengals warms up before the game against the Dallas Cowboys during the 2010 Pro Football Hall of Fame Game           Wide receiver Terrell Owens #81 of the Philadelphia Eagles runs past safety Kim Herring #22 of the Cincinnati Bengals during the first half of their preseason game on August 26, 2005          Terrell Owens #81 of the San Francisco 49ers celebrates in the end zone after scoring a touchdown against the Dallas Cowboys with 12 seconds left on December 8, 2002 at Texas Stadium in Irving, TexasAlthough he has not revealed the full reason behind his snub, Owens said in his statement: \u0027After visiting Canton earlier this year, I came to the realization that I wish to celebrate what will be one of the most memorable days of my life, elsewhere. \u0027At a later date, I will announce where and when I will celebrate my induction.\u0027One sports writer concluded that Owens was \u0027snubbing the Pro Football Hall of Fame of his presence at the induction ceremony this year after being snubbed the past two years\u0027.

Among the reasons he fell short were his being considered a isive teammate and negative presence in the locker room.Still, he received strong consideration for the hall before getting in last February, along with Moss, another standout receiver.\u0027I think T.O. actually was disappointed when he got in this year,\u0027 said Paul Domowitch of the Philadelphia Daily News, who presented Owens\u0027 case for induction and has been on the selection committee for 16 years.\u0027I think he was happier when he got snubbed and could play the part of the persecuted victim and moan on every radio talk show that was willing to bring him on about the unfairness of the process.\u0027Maybe he was worried that he would become forgotten after the induction ceremony. This way, he gets his gold jacket, but still will be remembered as the guy who told the hall to go stuff it,\u0027 he added.Another Owens supporter in the hall voting, Jarrett Bell of USA Today, has been on the selection committee for 21 years and was \u0027at a loss to understand\u0027 why Owens would decline to attend the inductions.But Bell, like Baker, stressed Owens\u0027 absence would not affect the ceremony much.\u0027Think of the other members of the class of 2018,\u0027 Bell said. He added: \u0027They deserve their upcoming honor and the celebration. There\u0027s no stain on them because someone doesn\u0027t want to show up.\u0027Think of the players who gave their all to the sport, including many worthy of Hall of Fame consideration, who will never be enshrined. \u0027Think of the family members of former players, coaches and officials – many of whom have passed away – pushing for their loved ones to receive special recognition for career accomplishments. Then think of Terrell Owens.

It\u0027s kind of puzzling. ...

This honor is something that I will cherish forever\u0027.Although he will not be on hand to see his bust unveiled in August, Bell said: \u0027Don\u0027t think of even considering it a sad day for the Hall of Fame.

That\u0027s laughable.\u0027Six other mosques are being closed down, three in Vienna, two in Upper Austria and one in Carinthia.All but one of the mosques affected belong to the \u0027Arab Religious Association,\u0027 according to the government.But while Turkey\u0027s presidential spokesman on Friday lambaste the measures as \u0027anti-Islam\u0027 and \u0027racist\u0027 move, other European far-right leaders welcomed the announcement.Marine Le Pen, the leader of the French Front National, said on Twitter: \u0027Austria is taking things in hand and showing that \u0027when you want to, you can!\u0027\u0027          Last week Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (pictured)attacked Kurz, saying: \u0027This immoral chancellor has a problem with us\u0027Matteo Salvini, head of Italy\u0027s League and interior minister in the new government, also tweeted his approval, saying: \u0027Those who exploit their faith to endanger a country\u0027s security should be expelled!\u0027Turkey\u0027s relations with Austria have long been strained, with Kurz calling on the European Union to break off negotiations on Ankara joining the bloc and banning Turkish politicians from campaigning in Austria for upcoming elections.Austria, a country of 8.8 million people, has roughly 600,000 Muslim inhabitants, more than half of whom are Turkish or have families of Turkish origin.Around 360,000 people of Turkish origin live in Austria, including 117,000 Turkish nationals.Last week Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attacked Kurz, saying: \u0027This immoral chancellor has a problem with us\u0027.\u0027He\u0027s throwing his weight around and making a scene,\u0027 Erdogan went on.Both Kurz, of the centre-right People\u0027s Party (OeVP) and the FPOe made immigration and integration major themes in their election campaigns last year.The topic had been pushed up the political agenda by the migrant crisis of 2015-16, which saw more than 150,000 people seek asylum in the country of 8.7 million.In Friday\u0027s press conference Kurz was keen to emphasise that the action was being taken under legislation to regulate Islamic associations that he himself brought in as a minister in the previous government and which had so far - in his opinion - not been used often enough.The conservative Kurz became chancellor in December in a coalition with the anti-migration Freedom Party.In campaigning for last year\u0027s election, both coalition parties called for tougher immigration controls, quick deportations of asylum-seekers whose requests are denied and a crackdown on radical Islam.The government recently announced plans to ban girls in elementary schools and kindergartens from wearing headscarves, adding to existing restrictions on veils.   "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/10/4D0B1E4700000578-5820509-image-m-88_1528451329737.jpg","title":"Richard Attenborough cast 15 stone Marlon Brando eight stone Gandhi film","story":"    Marlon Brando was over 15 stoneBrooding Hollywood icon Marlon Brando was earmarked to act as peace-loving Mahatma Gandhi in the historic, epic British-Indian film based on the man who led India to independence from Britain.Newly discovered archives, held at Sussex University, have finally been catalogued four years after Richard Attenborough’s death.Seventy boxes alone contain Attenborough’s correspondence about Gandhi and, in particular, a difficult choice he had to make about who should play the lead role, reports the Telegraph.Brando, though, was grossly overweight – he had completed his role as Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now.Gandhi, the political and spiritual leader, famously staged 17 hunger strikes during his long-running freedom campaign, the longest lasting 21 days, and he weighed about 50kg (eight stone). By comparison, Brando was nearly twice his size, hitting the scales at more than 15 stone (95kg). The archives show a who\u0027s who of acting legends, all white, considered for the role including Alec Guinness, Al Pacino, Albert Finney and Dustin Hoffman.In 1963, Attenborough wrote to Guinness, asking him to play the title role, however, Guinness’s agent replied in the negative, with the actor himself following up with a derisive comment about his portly physique: \u0027I’m too big, grey, fat and blue-eyed and would sound like Peter Sellers.\u0027          Gandhi director Richard Attenborough considered a who\u0027s who of acting legends including Alec Guinness, Al Pacino, Albert Finney and Dustin Hoffman          Richard Attenborough directing Gandhi, 1982Finney (The Bourne Ultimatum and Skyfall) also declined.

Hollywood icon Marlon BrandoThe hunt continued as the director realised the idea of having a white actor play the part of the Father of the Nation would not pan out. So, instead of choosing Brando, the actor famous for such films as A Streetcar Named Desire and The Godfather, Attenborough settled for Ben Kingsley, who he had seen in Bertolt Brecht’s Baal at the Donmar Warehouse.Riverdale producer signs a $400MILLION all-cash deal to stay...Shopfitters discover chest stuffed with £1m worth of...Share this articleSir Ben Kingsley, born Krishna Pandit Bhanji, was part Gujarati by descent.

It has since partly recovered as the ruble has strengthened, reaching nearly $90 billion last year.Russia has also increasingly turned to China as a market for its energy exports and a source of investment in infrastructure projects.Meanwhile, analysts remarked on the similar leadership styles of the men.Xi and Putin are \u0027soulmates who want to make their countries great again\u0027, Alexander Gabuev, senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center, said.

That same month, Xi was given a path to indefinite rule when the the Communist-led rubber-stamp parliament lifted presidential term limits.China is mired in tough negotiations with the United States to avoid a trade war, while Moscow has deep differences with Washington on multiple diplomatic fronts, including Syria and Ukraine.Putin played up his bond with his \u0027good friend\u0027 Xi in an interview with China\u0027s state broadcaster CGTN this week.He said the Chinese president was the only state leader to celebrate his birthday with him, with the two sharing vodka and sausage.Xi \u0027is approachable and sincere\u0027, Putin told CGTN. \u0027But he\u0027s also a very dependable man to work with.\u0027          Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during a joint press briefing at the Great Hall of the People Maria Repnikova, director of the Center for Global Information Studies at Georgia State University in the US, said China makes Russia look \u0027stronger and more relevant\u0027 on the global stage.For its part, Russia allows China to show the US that it has \u0027other options\u0027 in international negotiations, she said.\u0027Trump\u0027s policies justified (the) growing closeness, especially for Russia but also for China given the volatile relationship with the United States,\u0027 Repnikova said.But \u0027it\u0027s an asymmetrical relationship with Russia more dependent on China than vice versa, especially in the economic sphere,\u0027 she said.After the Beijing visit, Putin will join Xi at a weekend summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in the eastern Chinese city of Qingdao.China and Russia lead the regional security group, which includes former Soviet states and new members India and Pakistan.Putin told CGTN that the SCO had \u0027small\u0027 objectives when it was founded two decades ago but that it was now evolving into a larger global force.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, whose country is an observer member of the SCO, will also attend the summit at a time when China and Russia are seeking to save the Iran nuclear deal following Trump\u0027s withdrawal from the pact. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/13/4D0BE61600000578-5821115-image-a-59_1528461138119.jpg","title":"Scorned woman bashes ex boyfriends Range Rover telling sh ing around","story":"    The woman appears to have rammed her ex\u0027s Range Rover to get revenge for his \u0027sh***ing around.\u0027 Do you know this woman?

Saxon have hired BH Environmental Services Ltd which is licensed to carry out the cull\u0027Advice was taken from Natural England and the local authority prior to engaging Environmental Services.\u0027A hawk was used to disrupt the patterns of the geese and move them on, however such is the scale of the problem and the seriousness of the consequent threat to the health of our children, that a cull was necessary.\u0027We apologise for any upset this decision has caused. As a school, protecting the health and welfare of our children is paramount.\u0027The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) stopped short of outright criticism, saying the death of the geese could be \u0027a learning opportunity for pupils to explore the interconnectedness of people with nature\u0027.A spokesman said: \u0027For the RSPB, culling any wildlife is a last resort after all other options have been exhausted.\u0027These include habitat management techniques such as planting, fencing and a variety of deterrents or distractions.

Mother-of-two Noralyn, 42 (pictured), had parked in a leafy road in Hampstead, North London when she was attacked\u0027I feel angry: angry that the criminals are getting more brazen and violent. You think you are safe inside your car you\u0027re not any more.\u0027And I\u0027m angry there\u0027s no longer a police presence in our area. Hampstead is a prime target for these criminals. The thugs are getting more brazen as they know they can get away with it. It\u0027s frustrating and sad to learn that it now seems to be up to us to defend ourselves and come up with ways to deter these villains.\u0027Police say they have scoured CCTV footage of the area where the robbers struck. They have found nothing. No arrests have been made. \u0027Our inquiries continue,\u0027 they say.Moped crime has become an epidemic. This week, Scotland Yard revealed there have been 22,025 motorcycle muggings in the past 12 months (up 50 per cent on the year before), with armed thieves striking more than 60 times a day. Violent crime is up in 42 out of 43 police areas around the UK, and 1.3 million offences of violence against the person were logged last year — the highest since records began 15 years ago.In the past week alone in North London, an Australian TV presenter in Islington had a £15,000 camera ripped from the hands of her film crew by thugs and a woman was left fighting for her life after her mobile phone was snatched by a moped gang in Edgware. Then, moped muggers jumped onto the bonnet of car in nearby Finchley, knifing the driver and stealing a designer watch. Meanwhile, machete-wielding thugs broke into the home of a dentist in Cheshire, stealing £200,000 worth of valuables.          Shocking images of the robbery have been released by the police. One of suspects can be seen jumping onto to bonnet           Criminal gangs are now going for middle-class parents on the school runAnd, of course, there was the attack on millionaire comedian Michael McIntyre.Moped thugs threatened him and his terrified young son Oscar, ten, with a knife after smashing a window of his £120,000 Range Rover around 15 times with a hammer.The star, 42, had his £15,000 Rolex torn from his wrist by the gang who struck as he drove home after picking up Oscar from his school in North London.He may have been followed from his £5.7million Hampstead mansion and targeted for his exclusive timepiece.But his case shines a light on the new modus operandi of these criminal gangs: they are now going for middle-class parents on the school run.Why? They have calculated that parents with children on board, who are also stuck in after-school traffic, are easy pickings — not least because they are unlikely to jeopardise their children\u0027s safety by defending themselves.And the thugs feel invincible thanks to police failing to get to grips with the issue.Let\u0027s not forget that just 13 per cent of violent offences were solved last year. This was compared with 23 per cent in 2014. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem home affairs spokesman, summed it up this week: \u0027For some areas, it\u0027s fast becoming like the Wild West with criminals no longer afraid of getting caught.\u0027Nowhere is this more apparent than Hampstead — the area in which Noralyn Pitts and Michael McIntyre were attacked. I have watched crime rise alarmingly in recent years, first as crime reporter on local newspaper, The Hampstead and Highgate Express, then as its editor.There are rich pickings in this enclave of North London, populated by the wealthy, the famous and the metropolitan elite. It has more millionaires than any other area of the UK. And right now, it has more moped crime than anywhere else in the country, too.Out of the staggering 22,000 moped crimes in the past 12 months, 40 per cent of these offences happened on my patch, the boroughs of Camden and neighbouring Islington.          Pictures show stunned comic Michael McIntyre speaking with police moments after he was robbed by a moped gang          The comedian became another victim of London\u0027s plague of moped crimes when he was attacked in north LondonThe criminals are cynical, ruthless and opportunistic. They are also becoming increasingly violent.Last November, two men on a moped used hammers to smash through the front window of a bakery on Highgate High Street at around 2.45pm — when it was full of mums on the school run.One mother, who was having coffee before picking up her children from a nearby private school, told me: \u0027They were wearing helmets and started smashing the window with hammers. It sounded like gunfire.\u0027I ran to the bathroom with five other people, one of whom had an 18-month-old baby. It was nasty, brutal and done with complete disregard for people.\u0027There could easily have been more children in there. They could have easily hurt someone.\u0027The two men snatched a laptop before escaping on their bikes. A youth and man aged 21 were later charged in relation to the offence. Meanwhile, moped-riding burglars were last month responsible for an attempted raid on a house in an affluent Highgate road. May Chiao, editor of a science magazine, lives with her husband and their two daughters, aged six and nine, in an end-of-terrace property.          The robbers used hammers to destroy the driver\u0027s window and demanded his silver watch, worth around £15,000May, 46, recalls how the passenger on a moped began banging on her front door, then — when she failed to answer it — slamming his body violently against it as she bathed her six-year-old upstairs.\u0027It was 6.45pm. My older daughter was downstairs doing her homework. She froze and started shaking. I heard this crashing sound. I started running downstairs. I was calling out: \u0027What\u0027s going on?\u0027 And my daughter shouted back: \u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027\u0027I was terrified. I was running around from one room to the other thinking I should call my husband. The moped rider had the bike facing the road, ready for the getaway. Both men wore balaclavas and helmets.\u0027There were three loud bangs, then it went quiet. I ran to the bay window and saw the man coming back with a screw driver.\u0027May held her body against the door and set off the house alarm as the would-be burglar tried to dismantle the lock. The alarm system alerted the police.  Mr McIntyre wears his valuable Rolex most of the time (circled) but was seen without it on his wrist in the aftermath of the terrifying moped attack \u0027It all happened so quickly,\u0027 says May. \u0027I could see the guy with the screwdriver through the front door and he must have seen me standing there.\u0027The police arrived quickly enough — in five to ten minutes, says May — but the men had long since fled empty-handed.\u0027We worry we\u0027ll be attacked again,\u0027 she says. \u0027I think it\u0027s very important that people are aware of this problem. We have locks and we have an alarm.\u0027We never used to use our third lock, but we do now. When we had the alarm installed I thought it was ridiculous to have a panic button, but I\u0027m so glad we did.\u0027 How have we reached a stage where we must barricade ourselves in our homes with panic buttons and alarms and keep up vigilance?The blame, in my view, lies not with inidual policemen but with the wider police culture where catching criminals is hindered by red tape and health and safety fears.Cuts to police forces across the country — there are 21,000 fewer police today than there were in 2010 — have contributed.Three years ago, when I first noticed the new crimewave, I interviewed police Chief Superintendent Richard Tucker before he left Camden for a new post, and he admitted his frustration.\u0027There are protocols we have to follow,\u0027 he said. \u0027We cannot be chasing these bikes everywhere through the streets. It\u0027s not safe to do so. If a lad comes off and the police are chasing, there will be an investigation and officers will be held to account.\u0027I would not want, for the sake of a mobile phone, that a young lad would die, or a member of the public or a young police officer who is chasing a moped are maimed or killed,\u0027 he said.Police are loath, too, to release intelligence about where the moped gangs come from. Some operate as part of an organised network others are more ad hoc and informal. The vehicles they use are invariably stolen sometimes from delivery drivers, at other times from commuters.Many of those convicted of such crimes come from nearby areas of North London, although the percentage of offenders being caught is shockingly low.In Camden, Met statistics show that between April 2017 and April 2018, out of 8,264 reported offences of theft from the person, only 61 of these resulted in charges — around 0.7 per cent. None of London\u0027s wealthy boroughs is safe: robberies have taken place in Kensington \u0026amp Chelsea, Holborn and the West End, where this week a knife-wielding moped rider was wrestled to the ground by shoppers as he tried to ram-raid a luxury jewellers.The fear is that moped gangs will now go on to target the prosperous shires. The police, of course, assure us that they are working hard to keep the public safe.\u0027Every borough is mobilised to tackle offenders using local knowledge to tailor the policing required for their area, which may include Automatic Number Plate Reader deployments, conducting proactive investigations and operations which focus on high-volume offenders, and DNA capture. We are also using intelligence and CCTV to identify linked offences,\u0027 says a Met police spokesman.New weapons to fight back include slimline police scrambler motorcycles and a system that deploys a bed of hollow spikes that are activated remotely to deflate the tyres of motorbikes. Last month, the Home Office gave police drivers more legal protection in high-speed chases.I would also suggest, as a matter of utmost urgency, that regular stop-and-searches of moped riders are carried out, and that pillion riding — involved in nearly every offence — should be banned.In the meantime, like victim Noralyn Pitts, I am angry. Angry, that the area I grew up in and love, a neighbourhood that used to be such a peaceful, secure place to bring up children, is now being destroyed by these thugs.The police and the Government need to regain control of our neighbourhoods and protect the families who value them most — before there are more serious injuries or even deaths."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/21/4D0FD6F300000578-0-image-m-11_1528490885471.jpg","title":"Jermain Defoe left mixed emotions receiving gong charitable foundation","story":"    Footballer Jermain Defoe said he was ‘blessed and humbled’ after he was recognised for services to the charitable foundation set up in his nameFootballer Jermain Defoe said he was ‘blessed and humbled’ after he was recognised for services to the charitable foundation set up in his name.The Premier League star, 35, captured the nation’s hearts after developing a close friendship with six-year-old Sunderland fan Bradley Lowery, who had neuroblastoma, a rare type of cancer.Defoe said he felt ‘mixed emotions’ over the OBE, which comes almost a year after Bradley’s death.

The report showed some people, probably children, throwing gumboots in a field – the competitor who threw a boot furthest was the winner. It was things like this, Easton said, that made Yorkshire different from other places, which had their own traditions that were just as special to them. Some morris dancers appeared, and a man in a Tyneside pub talked about how collective hardship had forged the Geordie identity, these days manifested in a love of Newcastle United Football Club and an equal hatred of its rival in Sunderland. It all felt flimsy and sad – that “regional identity” should amount to this rickle of bones.The last colliery in the north-east closed in 2005, while the last shipyard on the Tyne launched its last ship in 2006, though those masculine industries had ceased to employ significant numbers long before. The north-east is poor, but then so are many other de-industrialised parts of the United Kingdom hardship and heavy industry alone can’t explain its particular difference. As for “welly wanging”, so far as I can tell it dates all the way back to AD2010.Thinking of Newcastle, I thought of my late mother-in-law, who lived and died there: a sweet and clever woman blessed with good humour (“This is my last territorial demand in Europe,” she might say, requesting a cup of tea at bedtime), who in her forgetful days asked me the same set of questions more than once. “What’s your tartan? Isn’t there a Jack tartan? Have you never worn a kilt?”My answers puzzled her – “I don’t know”, “I hope not”, “Not ever” – more by their brevity than anything else. I feel sorry for my irritation now. My explanation, that I came from a Lowland family, and had no entitlement to tartans, clearly didn’t wash. Having glanced through the window of more than one kilt emporium, she knew that the enterprise of the Scottish tourist industry had allotted a tartan to almost every surname in an old British telephone directory, often by deciding that a common Lowland name such as Taylor was really a “sept”, or subision, of a Highland clan such as Cameron. The clans ruled the roost.Oddly, given that Jacks lie thick in the graveyards of the Black Isle, my surname didn’t then feature on these lists. (It does now the Clan Jack Society registered a new design with the Scottish Register of Tartans in 2012.) But I didn’t at all regret the omission. What I found impossible to tell my mother-in-law, without making a priggish meal of it, was that the whole rigmarole of clans and tartans, sometimes known as Highlandism, was largely confected in the 18th and 19th centuries, and that any reality it might be connected to was far removed from the one most Scottish people knew and also that this feudal, claymore-wielding “identity” obscured a true history of achievement that had once made a trousered Scotland important to the world: Adam Smith, James Watt, Keir Hardie, the Forth Bridge and so on.It could have been a long speech, and tedious to the listener. I grew up hearing versions of it. Tartanry had many enemies in Scotland, particularly inside a socialist movement that was keen to establish a more class-based and less fanciful view of history. It fought what amounted to an underground campaign against figures such as Bonnie Prince Charlie and the music hall singer and comic Harry Lauder, who with his kilt and curly stick presented a caricature of Scotland at home and abroad.Kilts in the 1950s were still worn mainly by Scottish regiments and public schoolboys, and often regarded by the rest of us as a middle-class affectation. Mocking evidence came from new scholarship that the kilt’s modern form – the “small kilt” – had been invented in the 1720s by a Lancashire Quaker and ironmaster, Thomas Rawlinson, to dress the workers at his Highland smelter. In the first half of the next century, the Anglo-Welsh Allen brothers printed the first colour illustrations of tartans – inspired, they said, by an ancient but never produced manuscript – that showed how different clans and families had adopted their distinctive patterns at least as early as the 16th century.Hugh Trevor-Roper gave an entertaining account of these developments in his contribution to The\u0026nbspInvention of Tradition, a collection of essays edited by his fellow historians Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger and published in 1983. “The creation of an independent Highland tradition, and the imposition of that new tradition, with its outward badges, on the whole Scottish nation, was the work of the later 18th and early 19th centuries,” he wrote combatively and, as it turned out, to no sartorial consequence. (Thirty-odd years later, nine out of 10 Scottish bridegrooms get married in the dress devised by the ironmaster Rawlinson.)But his words were part of a general revaluation of Scottish history that did have a political effect. Scottish nationalism became less backward-looking, less romantic, less in thrall to fancy dress and myth. What too few people recognised – I include myself – was that no similar process was happening south of the border. England clings to history. Its view of its glorious past – as, for example, the begetter of parliamentary democracy and the lonely bulwark against Hitler – remains unmodified and may even have recently intensified. No myths have been shed.The results are apparent in opinion polls about national identity commissioned by the BBC, which led this week to Easton’s nightly appearance on the evening news. Welly wanging turned out to be a catchpenny sideshow, a misleading overture to more serious surveys of the states of mind of England, Scotland and Wales. All kinds of differences showed up, some unsurprising: fewer people in Scotland said that they felt “strongly British” than in England or Wales the percentage of people in Scotland who strongly identified as Scottish was larger than the percentage in England who strongly identified as English, or as Welsh in Wales.And so the quickening current sweeps our raft towards the waterfall, and the bones of Sir Francis Drake at its bottom."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ac83a750f4824a48257aab1fa7f5c8239a690a/113_0_3510_2106/master/3510.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35765d09add543b125eefc8a83d9eaf5","title":"love island dating men masculinity tv","story":"Women have no idea what men talk about when we are not in the room. Well, how could we? By definition, the conversation changes when we walk in. But most women have their suspicions. Locker room talk had a grim reputation even before Donald Trump. At best, women tend to assume that it’s secretly rather boring: all sport and cars, light on emotions.And that’s where the return of Love Island, ITV2’s spectacularly vacuous hit reality show, has proved unexpectedly interesting. For those readers sadly unfamiliar with the oeuvre, imagine Big Brother minus most of the clothes and all the intellectual pretensions. What’s left is a bunch of swishy-haired young women in skimpy bikinis and heels, thrown together somewhere around a swimming pool with a bunch of improbably muscled hunks in trunks. It’s about\u0026nbspas deep as a puddle in a summer drought, the last place on Earth you’d expect to find men’s innermost feelings laid bare. But while the rather seedy hook is the prospect of people trying to cop off with each other while under 24-hour surveillance, the TV gold here is in the endless conversations.The boys (for some reason they’re always boys, never men) huddle in one corner and the girls in another, earnestly swapping advice as they pick over the entrails of what can barely be called relationships yet. It’s the all-boys-together exchanges that are oddly revelatory. We are not used to seeing young men portrayed as vulnerable and insecure. Parents of sons see the hidden uncertainty in their own boys – the older my son and his friends get, the easier it is to recognise the softness still buried inside hulking great teens hanging out on street corners – but not always in other people’s. And while, rightly, there is much debate about how a porn-influenced culture promoting wildly unrealistic ideas of beauty hurts girls, or how dating apps such as Tinder have poisoned their relationships, we talk rather less about the impact on boys. Love Island is a reminder that it can be brutal for them too.Cheesy old Blind Date, the dating show my generation grew up with, at least paid lip service to the idea that personality mattered. Hidden behind a screen, contestants had a chance to win over their potential dates with terrible chat-up lines before the big reveal. But Love Island’s format is the horribly unforgiving swipe-left culture of online dating made flesh.It opens with the men being paraded one by one, like beefy show ponies, in front of the women, who are instructed to step forward if they fancy anyone. If the attraction’s mutual, you’re now a “couple”. If it isn’t, rejection is swift and crushingly public: the sexual equivalent of being picked last in PE, in front of millions. There’s no pretence that choices are made on the basis of anything other than “Well, would you?” since contestants barely exchange a sentence before matching. Those who don’t fit a certain, narrow definition of beauty are vulnerable. Samira, the sole black woman in the show, was last to be picked despite being gorgeous while Alex, an A\u0026ampE doctor adrift in a sea of spray-tanned models, was rebuffed by all the women. So far the standout theme is the rawness of rejection, and the way the men in particular cope.No doubt all the contestants are conscious that survival depends on charming voting viewers at home. They’d be mad not to be previous winners made six-figure sums from their overnight celebrity, helping explain the oft-quoted statistic that more people applied for Love Island this year than Oxbridge.But you’d need a heart of stone not to be moved by the sight of the lads earnestly comforting a distressed Alex, telling him he’s got a “great personality” and that it’s good to be smart even if it’s doing him no favours right now. There was something poignant, too, about watching laddish Jack pretending to the woman he was evidently falling for that he’s thrilled she only wants to be friends. How often do mass media portray young men putting a brave, rather than angry, face on sexual rejection? Yet it seems an important thing for teenage boys to witness, and to see rewarded.When young men hit the headlines, it’s so often in a threatening context: as sexual predators and perpetrators of violence, gang members and radicalised terror suspects, internet trolls and violent incels. Toxic masculinity evidently is a problem, one we too often shy away from naming.But there is another story that isn’t told enough, because it’s the kind of story the media are badly equipped to tell: the one where nothing much happens. Stuff doesn’t go dramatically wrong. Nobody dies. There is no news. Perfectly nice boys make mistakes but grow up into perfectly nice men, capable of dealing maturely with disappointment, with lives every bit as real as those that make the news. It’s ironic, obviously, that it should take a show as fake and exploitative as Love Island to put these lives on screen.But just like love, maybe reality sometimes hides in the last place anyone would ever think to look."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2c7adfddf0b39f4f025e51b3da3b4ce4db159c3/0_314_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2dc1991a41606327850599784b0c82b8 720w","title":"the wild workout a yorkshire coastal adventure","story":"The North York Moors national park hugs a coastline made for adventurers and the curious. Sarah Wharton tries her hand at foraging, fossil hunting, hiking and stand-up paddleboardingStay over in StaithesThe eclectic personality of Staithes reflects residents past and present. In the jumble of tiny cottages that spill down a gorge to the harbour have lived James Cook (later Captain), who came to work in a grocer’s store, and the influential Staithes group, a 19th-century artists’ group. It’s home to the Staithes festival of arts and heritage in September, and is a shoo-in for basecamp on a trip that takes in culture, natural history and a yomp. Rest up at the Endeavour B\u0026ampB, where host David Linley is a walking encyclopedia of activities, and heritage tales. He makes a mean breakfast too: don’t miss the kippers from Staithes’ own smokehouse. For dinner, try the delicious crab salad at the Royal George – like all pubs in this fishing village that’s something of a sovereign state, it’s independent and family owned. And if food and flavours really are your thing, then book a day of coastal foraging and cooking tips with Taste the Wild, which runs courses out of Staithes. Co-founder Chris Bax says: “Foraging reflects the resurgence of ersity in food: we let people rediscover things we used to eat but have dropped out of fashion.” The Attenborough in all of us will want to get closer to wildlife in an area rich in flora and fauna from moor to sky to sea. Jump aboard a birdwatching and cetacean safari with ecologist Richard Baines at Yorkshire Coast Nature (YCN) and you might just see some minke whales. Or stay grounded and snap up a seabird photography workshop with YCN’s Steve Race. Find your waveStand-up paddleboarding is “surfing without the faff of having to get up while the wave is breaking all over you,” says Simon Palmer, explorer, who co-founded SUP Adventures with Dan Fawkes. Both have that ex-military knack of turning what should be a gruelling encounter – with messy sea, two left feet or black skies – into a fun escapade and day-long grin. “People love it because it’s so accessible, irrespective of ability. It’s a terrific confidence booster if you’re anxious about getting out to learn a new activity or getting in the water. And it’s an all-body workout too.” Conquer position, posture and paddling technique at postcard-pretty Sandsend or alongside Saltburn’s trim, elegant Victorian pier. Then treat yourself to a follow-up session to learn how to read wave conditions and ride on to the beach. For something more stretchy, try SUP Adventures’ river yoga. Determined to have a Point Break moment? Head for surf spots at Staithes, where the rock bottom breaks produce powerful and defined waves (experienced surfers only). Or dip a beginner’s toe at Whitby’s West Cliff beach with Whitby Surf School. Hike into natureIf watersports aren’t your thing, then hiking along this extravagantly handsome Jurassic coastline, creaking with 200m years of stories, puritanical Victorian glamour and fishing folklore, will definitely get your heart rate up. North Yorks Moors senior ranger Bernie McLinden offers some tips: “Hayburn Wyke is a fantastic place to get to,” he says, referring to a secretish cove at the southern end of the North York Moors national park. “I was there at 7pm last night and even spotted a couple of surfers: they seemed to be having a great time.” With a waterfall that plops on to the beach, it’s a fairytale scene to take in on a circular five-mile walk that goes south along the Cleveland Way and returns along part of the Cinder Track, a defunct 21-mile railway line from Whitby to Scarborough that’s great cycling too. Another inspiring journey is the “source-to-sea” hike that picks up the river Esk at Westerdale Moor and closes at Whitby’s harbour mouth. At 37 miles, the full walk takes three or four days, but the Esk Valley railway enables you to cheat and do a day’s chunk to suit. “You might be lucky enough to see an otter along the way,” McLinden says. “At Sleights, if it’s the right time of year, you can see salmon leap. And in springtime, the woodland areas across the park are just wonderful, brimming with the beauty of the bluebells, primroses and ramsons.” Back in Staithes, if you have just 15 minutes to spare you can sprint southwards then upwards on to the cliff and a new part of the England Coast Path, to get the best view of the waterside hamlet. If you have longer, plump for a four-mile circle, taking in the industrial ironstone past of Port Mulgrave. Paddle back in timeThe Dinosaur Coast has never been more alive than when kinetic geologist, marine biologist and sailor Peter McGrath is talking about the natural kingdom that surrounds smartly turned-out Runswick Bay. He says: “One of ‘my’ best finds in 40 years came from my daughter Ruby on one of her first fossiling trips. ‘I’ve found an ammonite,’ she shouted casually. Not just any ammonite! A rare 18cm Hilderocas bifrons is a very good find.” McGrath is on a mission to discover and photograph every fossilised and living thing he can in the area, and shares his vast expertise with interested visitors as part of local firm Barefoot Kayak’s fossil foray team. If McGrath is the vim in this expedition, topping up your knowledge of fossil poo and Devil’s toenails (coprolites and Gryphaea respectively), Barefoot Kayak’s founder, paddlesport guide and coastguard Andy Monaghan provides the calm – putting the newly waterborne at ease with a deceptively laid-back style that nails safety. Paddling along with the duo is relaxing and stimulating in equal measure. Sea kayaking is manageable for most people and great for independent travellers or family groups with a yen for adventure.

Sexy? Day-to-night? Let us help you nail that fabulous forever frockRight, I’m here to tell you what the fashionable summer dress you need to buy this year looks like. I’m about to lay down the law on whether rose prints are more on trend than forget-me-nots, and explain whether a bell sleeve or a trumpet one will hoist you up the best-dressed lists. I’m going to map out those postcodes in which a cold shoulder is still de rigueur and those neighbourhoods in which you must switch to a kimono sleeve. And, after that, I’m going to explain how to break into your own house at the end of the night, if you are unable to take your keys out with you because they don’t fit into your on-trend miniature circular basketweave clutch bag.Or none of the above, actually. I’m here to help you find the perfect summer dress, which is absolutely not the same thing as the most fashionable one. The search for this dress transcends fashion for the simple reason that the perfect summer dress is an almost holy object. The days on which this piece will be worn are the most precious of the whole year, and that makes the dress itself a kind of talisman.There is something nostalgic at the heart of how we think of summer. The summers of long ago stretch out and warm up as the photographs fade, becoming balmier and more lazy in memory than in reality. Nostalgia never goes out of style, so being on trend really isn’t the be all and end all. And besides, many of the best bits of summer are not particularly fashion-forward. There is nothing cool about most weddings, but they are still almost always brilliant: the fact that the bridesmaids are in lurid mint green won’t stop you welling up. There is nothing modish about following a pub garden dinner of beer and salt and vinegar crisps with a cup of tea and two rounds of toast and Marmite munched standing up in the kitchen when you get home, but it remains a stone-cold classic al fresco dining scenario.I am a fully paid-up devotee of erring on the side of overdressed rather than underdressed, but that doesn’t mean you always have to be edgy. There is something a bit naff about trying to be cooler than the party you are going to. Much better to be the most fun guest at the wedding, the one still twirling baby bridesmaids around the dancefloor at midnight, than the one whose day peaked with the 11am mirror selfie of her outfit. The most successful summer dresses I’ve bought recently have been lightweight but with sleeves and a long hemline. There’s a dark Rixo one with a constellation print, below the knee, but with subtle, thigh-high splits in the skirt and a Boden one in rose pink that has singlehandedly converted me to ankle length, because it makes me feel serene even when it’s 27C on the bus. I feel carefree, rather than exposed. They are cool on a hot pavement, but I don’t get goosebumps under air conditioning. I find they work best in a strong colour andor print the ethereal white-nightie vibe makes me feel a bit silly – though it looks charming on lots of other people, so each to their own.Our edit of this summer’s best dresses includes stripes and leopard print, polka dots and florals.

After that he will depart from Disney permanently.Lasseter in November took what he called a six-month “sabbatical.” He apologised “to anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug” or any other gesture that made them feel “disrespected or uncomfortable”. At the time, Lasseter signalled that he hoped to then return to Disney. “The last six months have provided an opportunity to reflect on my life, career and personal priorities,” Lasseter said in a statement. “While I remain dedicated to the art of animation and inspired by the creative talent at Pixar and Disney, I have decided the end of this year is the right time to begin focusing on new creative challenges.”The 61-year-old Lasseter, easily recognisable for his bright Hawaiian shirts, is the highest-ranking Hollywood executive to be toppled in the wake of the #MeToo movement. A pioneer in digital animation, he has been a creative force behind every Pixar release as well as Disney hits like Frozen, Moana and Zootopia. Lasseter directed Pixar’s breakthrough feature Toy Story as well as it first sequel, Toy Story 2.After Disney acquired Pixar in 2006, Lasseter was named chief creative officer of Pixar as well as Disney Animation. Under Lasseter, the previously flagging animation studio was reborn through both Pixar and Disney releases that have amassed billions in box office and a string of Oscars.Bob Iger, chief executive of Disney, praised Lasseter for his vision and assembling storytellers and innovators “to set the standard in animation for generations to come”“John had a remarkable tenure at Pixar and Disney Animation, reinventing the animation business, taking breathtaking risks, and telling original, high quality stories that will last forever. We are profoundly grateful for his contribution, which included a masterful and remarkable turnaround of The Walt Disney Animation Studios.”Pixar’s latest, Incredibles 2, opens in the US next week. Lasseter is an executive producer of the anticipated sequel, which is expected to be among the biggest box-office debuts for an animated release.Disney has not announced his successor."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15eb69ccb8b315aba4d1f6cdddd7553c75cd3419/4_337_6236_3741/master/6236.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef54e1500c7e6298b70f152f51d438dc","title":"kenny dalglish is knighted in queens birthday honours list","story":"• Liverpool great wins recognition for football and charity work• Scot joins elite group after support for Hillsborough victimsThe “King” is to become a knight. The Liverpool and Celtic legend Kenny Dalglish has been awarded a knighthood in the Queen’s birthday honours in recognition of his services to football, charity and the victims of the Hillsborough disaster in 1989.Dalglish’s absence from honours lists since being made a MBE in 1984 has been a source of bewilderment and consternation at Liverpool’s Anfield home, where his status is reflected in the “King Kenny” moniker. That has been rectified with the announcement that the 67-year-old will join a select band of knighted former footballers and managers, a list that includes England’s World Cup winning manager Alf Ramsey, Bobby Charlton, Bobby Robson and Dalglish’s one-time Manchester United adversary Alex Ferguson. He is the first Liverpool player or manager to be given the honour with Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley, the only English manager to win the European Cup three times, both overlooked.In a playing career ning 22 years the Glasgow-born footballer scored 167 goals in 322 appearances for Celtic and 172 goals in 515 games for Liverpool, where he is widely regarded as the club’s finest player. He won nine league championships at Anfield – three as manager – three European Cups and three FA Cups. He is also Scotland’s most capped international with 102 appearances, joint-leading scorer with 30 goals and led Blackburn Rovers to the Premier League title in 1995. But Dalglish’s impact transcends the football pitch, as the citation for the knighthood recognises.“He was Liverpool manager at the time of the Hillsborough disaster in 1989,” it reads. “He selflessly made himself available to the families of the bereaved, attending most of the funerals, organising hospital visits and attending annual memorial services held at Anfield. He has been a steadfast supporter of the families in their quest for and throughout the Hillsborough Inquiry, and was granted Freedom of the City of Liverpool in recognition of his work. He is the co-founder of The Marina Dalglish Appeal, his family’s cancer charity which opened the £1.5m Centre for Oncology at University Hospital, Aintree in 2007 and which has raised over £10m in total.”Dalglish and his wife Marina, now Lady Dalglish, once attended in one day the funerals of four Liverpool fans who were unlawfully killed at Hillsborough. The impact of the disaster on the then 38-year-old led to his resignation as Liverpool manager in 1991. The former Liverpool Walton MP Steve Rotheram, now metro mayor for the city region, tabled a Commons motion in 2011 for Dalglish to be given a knighthood. The motion was signed by 13 MPs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ae0de6404c4a47b21a230b8286e1e8379d871a/0_244_3668_2201/master/3668.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d71e37ce9be2e9466be9be4d03b8f9ec","title":"liverpool nabil fekir transfer in doubt injury","story":"• France international’s move on hold over fitness fears• Liverpool had hoped to announce signing on FridayNabil Fekir’s proposed £53m move to Liverpool has been put on hold due to concerns over the France international’s fitness.Liverpool had hoped to announce the 24-year-old’s signing on Friday afternoon having reached agreement with Lyon over the terms of his transfer on Thursday, contrary to a strongly-worded denial by the French club.The deal was so far advanced that Fekir had not only undergone a Liverpool medical in Paris and agreed personal terms on a five-year contract but conducted an introductory interview with LFCTV, the club’s in-house television channel.An issue with the Lyon captain’s fitness, however, delayed the announcement and placed the transfer in doubt. The attacking midfielder, a key transfer target for Jürgen Klopp this summer, ruptured a cruciate ligament in September 2015 that caused him to miss the majority of the 2015-16 campaign. He also missed several weeks of last season with a knee problem.The delay threatens Liverpool’s plans to secure their second major signing of the summer – and the second most expensive transfer in their history – before the World Cup. France play their final warm-up game against the United States in Lyon on Saturday and the manager Didier Deschamps wants all transfer business settled before the squad flies to Russia.There would be greater consequences for Klopp’s summer transfer strategy should the issue remain unresolved. Liverpool’s manager views Fekir as a replacement for Philippe Coutinho and a perfect fit for a squad already strengthened by the acquisitions of the midfielders Fabinho and Naby Keita this summer. The club has also registered an interest in Xherdan Shaqiri, available for a release clause of between £12m-£13.5m following Stoke City’s relegation from the Premier League.Lyon issued a statement on Friday morning denying Fekir was on the brink of moving to Merseyside. “Olympique Lyonnais categorically denies the false information disseminated by many media about the transfer of Nabil Fekir to Liverpool,” it read. “In this period of transfers where the slightest rumour is often presented as a reality, Olympique Lyonnais reminds that only the information disseminated by the club on its website is authentic.”The statement, however, followed a breakthrough in negotiations between Liverpool sporting director Michael Edwards and Lyon officials and an agreement that Fekir would cost an initial 55m euros plus 5m euros in bonuses.Meanwhile Emre Can will leave Liverpool when his contract expires this summer. The 24-year-old moved to Anfield from Bayer Leverkusen in July 2014 for £10m and is expected to move to Juventus.Jon Flanagan, who spent the end of last season on loan at Bolton, is also leaving Anfield."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/305e493bc8018ac93f3afbbec47f56b82eccecea/0_108_3488_2093/master/3488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=309d9d50d1d3ab2e319a215760f9ca7a","title":"russia england womens world cup qualifier match report","story":"England took another significant step towards next summer’s World Cup finals on Friday with Fran Kirby’s exquisite playmaking skills defying the Russians’ attempts to kick her and Keira Walsh controlling midfield.Thanks to two goals from Jill Scott and another from Nikita Parris in Moscow, Phil Neville’s side returned to the top of their qualifying group, two points clear of Wales with two games to go. Considering only the group winners are guaranteed places in the finals – the best second-placed sides enter the play-offs – this was an important win for Neville before the potentially pivotal trip to Wales at the end of August.When England thrashed Russia 6-0 at Tranmere last September Parris opened the scoring. Relocated to Moscow, the Manchester City striker not only repeated the feat but registered her fifth goal in five World Cup qualifiers.After temporarily swapping flanks with Toni Duggan, Parris drifted inside, stole in front of her marker and connected with a precise right-wing cross from the Barcelona forward before heading beyond Russia’s goalkeeper, Yulia Grichenko.The Lionesses have clearly taken to Neville and the former Manchester United and Everton full-back looked pleased with his side’s performance on an awkward artificial surface.Another header, from Scott this time, doubled England’s advantage. Neville claims that Lucy Bronze could hold her own in the men’s game and the Lyon right-back – captaining the Lionesses in the absence of the injured Steph Houghton – proved she was far too strong for Russia by crossing brilliantly to the far post and picking out Scott’s late dash into the box.It was becoming almost too easy for Bronze and company which possibly explains why England’s captain momentarily lost concentration and allowed Russia to pull a goal back. After neglecting to clear her lines in the wake of a long throw Bronze failed to prevent a dangerous cross finding Elena Danilova unmarked. If the invitation was unexpected, Danilova had no hesitation in accepting it by rising unchallenged to head beyond the helpless Carly Telford.That was the first goal England had conceded along the qualifying road to France but Scott’s mobility ensured it did not take them long to restore a two-goal cushion. Walsh has been one of a number of young players introduced by Neville and she vindicated his judgment by finding her Manchester City team-mate with a beautifully weighted through-pass. By way of returning the compliment, Scott, making another clever late run into the area, volleyed her second goal of the match past Grichenko with the outside of her boot.Despite sporadic tactical tweaking, Russia failed to contain Kirby and her elusive movement between the lines. The Chelsea creator, shifted from attack to a slightly deeper attacking-midfield role under Neville, was frequently minded by Anna Kozhnikova, whose style was cramped when she incurred a booking for sending Kirby crashing on to that unforgiving surface.From the resultant free-kick Duggan tested Grichenko before making way for Beth Mead and, shortly afterwards, Ellen White was replaced by the similarly dangerous Jodie Taylor. Perhaps deterred by the strength of Neville’s bench, Russia had by now abandoned any early pretence of attacking and, dropping ever deeper, were grimly intent on damage limitation.Although the hosts belatedly escaped their own half as Telford saved smartly when left one on one against Ekaterina Sochneva, it was far too little too late for a Russian team whose prime ploy of attempting to foul Kirby out of the game appeared to be about the extent of an alarmingly limited game plan. They now travel to Wales on Tuesday with any lingering hopes of qualification all but extinguished."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/592fe40bbeccc30f72e94678ff2ba58a5b61e5fb/0_95_2464_1479/master/2464.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51d4eee689a425a9a425662f4b6559e0","title":"anthony bourdain made food writing muscular and kinetic","story":"Food critic Jay Rayner pays tribute to the chef who knocked down culinary walls Anthony Bourdain, TV chef and travel host, found dead aged 61 Anthony Bourdain was, by his own estimation, a jobbing restaurant cook who “just got lucky”. It’s a classic bit of Bourdain understatement. It’s true he was never a chef who was going to knock down culinary boundaries – Bourdain was schooled in the French classics – but as a writer he was massively influential, changing forever what the business of food and appetite on the page could be.Before the publication in 2000 of Kitchen Confidential, his memoir of life as a line cook, food writing was, for the most part, a job for those who had pulled their sizeable bellies up to the table in the dining room. It was effete and delicate. Bourdain gave a voice to the career cooks on the other side of the kitchen door the ramshackle, itinerant tribe of restaurant chefs, with their skin burns, tattoos, appetite for long hours and hard drugs. He made food writing muscular and kinetic. He blew the whistle on how your steak was likely to be cooked in a big New York restaurant – by being dumped in the deep fat fryer – and famously cautioned against eating sushi on Mondays, because the fish was less than fresh.Naturally enough, in time, there was a backlash. There were accusations that he was falsely glamorising a life of excess – one he had abandoned – though his fans from behind those kitchen doors wouldn’t hear a word against him. You could spot them a mile off at the public events which inevitably became part of the author’s working life: pallid skin, wild hair, clutching a stained volume they wanted to be signed.Although it was writing that gave him his profile, Bourdain’s biggest contribution to food media may well have been to television. His various series, first for the Food Network, then later the Travel Channel and CNN, had an immersive, nerdy quality that fixed the dishes he was eating to the communities and cultures from which they came. Without him, vast amounts of today’s food content – the various documentary strands, such as Ugly Delicious on Netflix – simply wouldn’t exist.I shot a sequence with him for a London-based show in the summer of 2016 at Fergus Henderson’s St John in Clerkenwell, which he regarded as a culinary temple. He made it clear it was now the mechanics of film-making that most intrigued him. He had no time for the usual artifice of TV: no retakes, no stop-starts, just shoot what happens. As he told the New Yorker in 2017: “I travel around the world, eat a lot of shit, and basically do what the fuck I want.” The fact that Bourdain’s long, rambling journey has finally come to such a sad end will leave his army of fans, including this one, utterly bereft."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21280072fdf3d492d8da9cfdc115430fa665755e/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1276488b83b790b920c97b7eeee1ff2","title":"blind date impassioned short shorts stu richard","story":"Was Stu, 29, charity worker, a bit full-on for Richard, 32, employment lawyer?What were you hoping for?Someone with a good heart and a cheeky smile.First impressions?Handsome and polite nervous but quietly confident.What did you talk about?Yorkshire, Gladiators, and living your best authentic life.Any awkward moments?During one of my rants about a city he misheard “too wide” as “too white”.Good table manners?Flawless.

I’m parked on a Cornish industrial estate with no warmth except the tiny, wavering plume of heat that rises out of my lantern. This place is so lonesome that even the doggers, boy-racers and stoners have spurned it. I curse myself silently. You’re not a Traveller, my mate, you’re a . What sort of Traveller would come and sleep here on their own? I have covered thousands of miles in my van in a bid to uncover the history of Gypsy Britain. But the road is proving tough.Gypsy reality is partly composed of fairgrounds and showgrounds, picturesque lakeside halts, sheltered commons, bright heaths. But it also comprised frozen copses and hilltops. Old maintenance roads with potholes and bad light. Scrapyards. Council waste ground. Lay-bys near the edges of tips. Slag-heaps and drained marshes. Fen ends. Chalk pits, yards and quarries. These are the stopping places, these fringes and in-between places. They are the places that nobody lives except Travellers – or nobody but those who share ancient connections with them: gamekeepers and poachers, scrap-metal men, horsewomen, rangers and shepherds. They are the old nomads’ haunts of the island. Many are smashed and built over some – magically – are still more or less just as they were in centuries long past. They form the hidden Gypsy and Traveller map of the country we live in: they are the bedrock of our reality and, perhaps, the antidote to the unending cycles of romanticisation and demonisation.I had conceived a plan to visit these places, to live in them in my own way, and see what I might learn. Perhaps I might even solve the bizarre contradiction of Britain’s love affair with caravanning, camping and glamping, and its hatred of those who were born to this life, and who largely inspired its adoption as a non-Gypsy pastime. As one Scottish Gypsy Traveller put it: “There are 80,000 members of the Caravan Club, but I’m not allowed to travel?”There is more to this Gypsy geography than a list of physical places. The stopping places themselves are an outgrowth of something non-physical, something that is ancient, unseen yet important, precious and reviled, envied and feared. This thing is the Gypsy belief – the core belief of the culture – that it is possible to live in a different way: in your own way, part of the world, but not imprisoned by the rules. That you can know the ropes and yet not be hemmed in by them. That you can dwell alongside the mainstream, while not being part of it. Otter-like, you can live in the bank of the river and swim and hunt there when you need to, and then climb back out with equal ease and alacrity. There is no better symbol of this belief than the network of atchin tans (stopping places) laced across Britain they are historical, topographical proof that the Gypsy philosophy has existed here, that it still does, that it still can. By staying at the traditional stopping places, I hoped to answer the questions that had been following me, on and off, all my life. What is left of these places? What might we learn from them? What redemption might lie there, in a country that still passes new legislation aimed at ending the Traveller way of life? Is it still possible to live on the road? Was the end of the old Gypsy life a tragedy, or was it a case of good riddance to an irredeemably hard and pitiless life on the edge? Above all, I hoped to resolve the biggest question: the question of myself, whether I could make my peace with Gypsy culture. My conflict seemed to echo the wider tension between nomads and settled people that endures in modern Britain.On the way to our regular pitch selling flowers in the marketplace in Petersfield, my elders would point and nod at empty spaces by the sides of the road, flat areas on verges and slightly raised banks, vacant pull-ins and lay-bys, and make comments as if there was something there, something I couldn’t see. They were glimmers of another world, but it felt as distant as the stars. I knew the places had something to do with the time they were “on the road” – most of my family were settled now, living in houses or caravans and mobile homes on private bits of land.Travellers I knew from the east of England had lived rough deep into the recent past, still working the farms into the 1990s. By then, it had been the best part of 50 years since anyone in my family had depended on that kind of work. So it came as a shock to meet Travellers younger than me who had grown up picking turnips in January. They described reaching down with a gloved hand and grabbing hold of the big, leafy tops, how it would sometimes send a plug of ice shooting upwards.Alongside selling flowers, my family had roofing and car-breaking businesses. We had a big field and a yard, a word that seemed to mean a place where all things might, and did, happen. Terriers, geese and perturbed-looking cockerels roamed in between the legs of cantankerous horses. Stables were stacked full of the musty paraphernalia of horsemanship, flower-selling, roofing and car respraying. Bits of cars lay everywhere, named as if they were the parts or clothes of people or animals: bonnets, boots, seats, wings, belts. There were brass-handled horsewhips, jangling harnesses, buckets of molasses-sprayed chaff and milled sugar-beet, bales of sweet-smelling fresh hay. But all of this old rustic stuff was stacked and wedged in among the hard and greasy gear of the family economy: gas bottles, blowtorches, leaky old engines, spray paint, rolls of lead, felt, and seemingly infinite stacks of every conceivable type of roof tile. A heavy boxing bag swung with barely perceptible creaks, keeping time in the half-light of the dusty old garage.There were caravans there that we sometimes lived in and out of, especially in the summer. We never considered this odd, even though we also had a big house on the land that my grandad had built with his men. And there always seemed to be heavy and dangerous things lying close to hand. The hard stuff of motion was everywhere, although we were settled: cars, tractors and trucks, some brand-new, others eaten by weather and time horses, ponies, traps, sulkies and carts scattered wheels and bolts from Ford and Bedford lorries. And, hung from a barn door like a pair of swords and scabbing to ochre with rust, there were two axles rescued from the ashes of the last wagon owned by our family.We had a name for ourselves: Travellers. In our case, it didn’t just mean anyone who travelled around, regardless of their race: to us it meant our people specifically, the Romanies of Britain. The first Romanies probably arrived on the British mainland towards the end of the 15th century, and had been a contentious presence ever since.Wherever the Gypsies went, they took with them their strange tongue, Romani, and it was through this that the mystery of their origins was solved. An 18th-century German linguist called Johann Rüdiger overheard Gypsies talking, and was struck by the similarity of their speech to Indian languages. Later linguists, including the so-called “Romany Ryes” – rye being the Romani word for a gentleman – such as the English writer George Borrow and the Irish academic John Sampson, would identify layers of borrowings from Persian, Slavic and Romance languages in the Gypsies’ speech, using these to trace a philological map of their long road into the West. English Romani had German-derived words in it, like nixis, meaning “nothing”, and fogel for “smell”.As for the name of the Romanies, it was derived from their own word for “man” or “husband”, rom, and it had nothing to do with Romania, which got its name from the Roman military camps which once filled its territory. The Gypsies called their language Romanes, an adverb meaning “like a rom”. To rokker Romanes meant, simply, to talk like a Gypsy and not like a gorjer – a non-Gypsy. The word gorjies comes from the old Romany word gadje or gadzhe, and though its form has mutated with time, its meaning is the same: the non-Gypsies, outsiders, the people-who-aren’t-us.Almost everyone who has studied Romani in Britain has remarked on how adept its speakers are at coming up with names for things. In some ways, talking Romanes means having to be constantly inventive and alert, both in terms of creating words and also interpreting the new ones that get spun off the cuff and thrown into daily Traveller conversation. There is no stigma attached to inventing words, as there so often is in English nor are new words looked down upon as annoying neologisms that we’d be better off without. Invented words are more likely to be smiled upon or chuckled at as evidence of a witty, intelligent mind one with a good and flexible grasp of the ancient Travellers’ tongue.Besides, if Romani is to retain one of the functions which has kept it alive thus far – and which it has in common with almost all minority languages – namely, to stop outsiders knowing what you are talking about, then it will always be necessary to invent new ways of saying things. According to a Belarusian Romany man I once met, a word is no longer a truly Romani word once its meaning becomes known amongst the gadzhe – it is useless, dead, and best left where it is. This is an extreme opinion, but it points to a common anxiety: that the language will lose its power if it becomes too widely known. Yet words come and go as they please, like mood and temper traded by friends, explained by lovers, and hurled across the fray. Every Gypsy who “gives away” the Romani language risks the accusation of treason.In the old Romany tradition, you can only call yourself a true Romany Gypsy – one of the kaulo ratti, the black blood – if all your ancestors, as far as you know, are of the tribe. I can trace my Romany ancestry back at least six generations I was brought up to know the Romani language to learn the old tales and to keep the Romanipen – the cleanliness taboos of the old-fashioned Gypsies. I was raised, and still live, in a Romany psychological realm a mental Gypsyland.I have both Gypsy and non-Gypsy blood and so, in many Travellers’ eyes, I do not have the right to call myself a true-bred Romany. It does not matter that there is no such thing as a racially pure Gypsy: over a 1,000-year migration it is virtually impossible that there will have been no mingling in the line. The mixing in my family had happened within living memory, and this meant I was at best a poshrat – a mixed-blood Gypsy – and at worst a “half-chat gorjie” or, as a friend once memorably put it, a “fucked-up half-breed”.I do not look like most people’s idea of a typical Gypsy, my blue eyes and fair hair belying my origins, my picture of myself. My identity was inside me and the outside didn’t match up. It imbued me with a tetchy defensiveness, and a resentment of people whom I then believed had simpler ethnicities: Scottish, Nigerian, Han.I felt so close to my roots, and especially to the Romany women who had brought me up – my mum her mother, Gran and Gran’s mother, Nan. But this seemed to count for little in a world which, for all its modernity, still believed in labels such as “half-caste”, “full-blood” and “mixed race”. Later, as a teenager, I started carrying photographs of darker-haired family members in my wallet, to challenge the disbelief of those who thought I was lying about my Romany background. I lived in a world that wasn’t sure if I really belonged in it, and so I wasn’t sure, either. Regardless, it was where I was. Our family were the mistrusted local Gypsies, the bane of the decent, upstanding parish council. We were “gyppos”, “pikeys”, “diddakois”, “them lot”. Locally, we were infamous. The ide was crystal clear.Compared with the insults and slurs, the words Romanies, Gypsies, and Travellers were dignified, and we used all of them interchangeably. The greater part of our family owned their own yards and bungalows, but the name Travellers still seemed to make sense. There were wheels everywhere, and we were always on hair-trigger alert to hook up trailers and go when the need arose: we drove miles for a living, and had family who lived on the road. Some places with links to the Travellers were not easily romanticised. The sides of the M1, the A1, the A303 and the M25 are peppered with modern-day atchin tans. They are sites with access to opportunities to earn money, and – being less desirable to non-Gypsies – also the sorts of locales where less cash is needed to set up a camp.Such places symbolise the misunderstood truth of many Traveller lives, which is that they are neither permanently nomadic, nor ever truly static. Howbeit, these yards provide a base, the highway is right beside them, ready for the times when family ties, work, a wedding, a funeral, the fair season, beckon. Councils refer to them as “sites close to the key regional transport corridors, favoured by Gypsies and Travellers”. Travellers call them :“Handy, being right by that main road”. Handy, yes, but still handcuffed to tragedy. Every family is haunted by stories of relatives, too often toddlers, who have been knocked down and killed by their literal closeness to roads.The word “Gypsy” wasn’t often heard back when I was a teenager. When it was, it was usually as part of a story about the old days, where someone had shouted out, “Dirty Gypsies!” and nine times out of 10 a fight had ensued, which the dirty Gypsies – who, in my grandad’s words, were “rough, tough and made out of the right stuff” – almost always won.In our world, arguments are often resolved by somebody leaving and the relationship being severed. If this doesn’t happen, then there will almost always be a fight. In the best-case scenario, it’ll just be a fair fist fight, nice and clean, one-on-one, with a referee to see fair play and as few spectators as possible to get sucked into the row. It can be between two men or two women: it’s usually men, but not always. These things are often organised quickly in a place right out of the way, so the law is unlikely to be an issue plus, some police officers I’ve spoken to even seem to have a laissez-faire stance on it, possibly because they have seen worse ways of ending a row than a bare-knuckle fight. Worst-case scenario, it will not be clean and it will not be fair, and the more people that get involved, the more likely that is. If weapons come into it, then the police are especially likely to show an interest.The proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674-1913 are speckled with references to London’s Gypsies and Travellers. There is a website that explains why they were “over-represented in the proceedings”: they formed part of “what many contemporaries considered a dangerous and crime-prone “residuum”’, which seeped back into the city at autumn following the end of the temporary farm work. It goes on, telling how “in a working-class mirror to the elite’s “London Season”, October and November saw hundreds and thousands of men, women and children returning to the capital from hop-picking and market gardening, from touring the fairs and tramping in search of work”. It was a yearly migration from the city to the countryside and back that continued, for some, right up to the 1950s.For all its flighty connotations, Gypsy culture can be stifling in its demands for living in line with its hidden rules. Rock stars employ “Gypsy” to mean those who have escaped from moral claustrophobia, but in reality, Gypsies are just as likely to feel confined as anybody else. In Glasgow, I watched as a troupe of little girls from the local Roma community danced in brightly coloured dresses at a community event. They clicked their fingers on outstretched arms and sang “Ja tuke tuke” to a furious klezmer beat. The audience clapped and twirled, unaware of the lyrics’ meaning: “Get away from me.”Nan talks of the old paradox that we have heard about all of our lives. The hardship of old times, versus the sense of togetherness that Travellers have lost. The gratitude for comforts that not long ago were undreamed of and unheard of, set against the moral corruption, unhappiness and constant malaise that have come from an overfast integration into the gorjies’ consumerist world.For centuries, politicians had guessed that if Gypsies could be settled in regular housing, then within a few short generations they would be just like everyone else. There would be no need for a word for outsiders, because we would be just like them. But that isn’t what has happened. Many Gypsies now live either in housing, or on permanent caravan sites, not in meadows or lanes or lay-bys or by the sides of old tips. And yet they are still what they are, changed in some ways, but different enough to draw the old line between themselves and the gorjies.I sometimes wonder what Nan thinks I am. Of course, I am her great-grandson, born from her line, flesh and blood. But I’m not what she calls a “true Traveller”. Aside from my mixed roots, I wasn’t born to that life: I arrived into a changed era, one of stability, stasis, hot running water, and Christmases stacked with teetering piles of presents. The Romany bloodline never dies out. But the life of the Traveller changes, sometimes so much so that you could forgive the outside world for thinking the people themselves have vanished.When I was small, Horsmonden in Kent was a typical Travellers’ horse fair. This meant that most people weren’t actually there for the horses. It’s true that a core of those who came, mostly men but quite a few women as well, were proper horse people. They came towing their boxes with strong cobs standing inside, tethered in the half-light their two-wheeled sulkies – light trotting carts with a seat big enough for one or two people – and their harness, head collars and whips. But people came from far and near to the fair, and most of them weren’t interested in any equine displays. If they were, then it was simply because they provided an authentic backdrop. What they were interested in depended on the inidual: but mostly, they were interested in each other. It is a quirk of our scatteredness: a few hundred thousand people at most, flecked across Britain’s damp islands, and we meet mostly at weddings, funerals and fairs. The horse trade has its ups and downs – as I write this, it’s down, the worst in my lifetime. But the horse fairs will persist, because their purpose goes beyond trade.When the days are hot and tanned skins gleam with sweat in the sun, it is clear once again that horse fairs are shop windows for young brides and husbands. They always have been. This much, at least, is gospel, and proudly announced to journalists and inquisitive souls who come asking questions about the culture. But not every dalliance ends in a marriage, and rumours occasionally flare of unauthorised, ultra-brief flings at the fringes of fairs: dangerous liaisons that lead to bad names, fights, or worse, feuds that run on and on.For the not so young, what they seek from each other is something subtler, less clear to outsiders, but an equally powerful draw. I suspect few would want to explain what it was, for fear of sapping its power by giving it voice. What the fairs offer is a chance to track the progress of our lives: to reminisce about previous years when we trod the same field, but equally to remark on how far we have come.We polish and dress up our lives for the day and compare them to the lives of others, affirming their context, confirming their meaning. The fairs are where we remind ourselves who we are. It’s not that we don’t keep being who we are in between – of course we do. But the fairs provide a special concentration of Traveller experience, a tincture of what it is to be a Gypsy. At a horse fair we get to see, just for one day, what life would be like if the world shared our Gypsy priorities.And then there are those who despise both horses and the fairs. For some families, the horse had its day a long time ago. I once asked my mate Charles if he and his family used to go to the fairs up north, which is where he comes from. He looked at me as though the question was perverse. “We don’t mind a day at the races, but Damian, can you see me or me dad, or any of us here, fucking about with horses? My great-great-grandad was a proper Gypsy man, and he was driving a Rolls-Royce a hundred year ago.”Traveller culture, preoccupied though it can be with bygone times, has always preferred the tangible: today’s bread, the here and the now. As Nan says, “You can only eat one meal at a time.” In the past, writers took this as evidence that Gypsies inhabited a “heroic present”, lacking a sense of history and living so sharply in the moment that concepts such as deferred gratification were lost on them. I have always dismissed such ideas as inherently dangerous: they are liable to slide into essentialism, and the belief that races have irreconcilable differences. But maybe in turning so sharply away from a lie, I lost sight of a truth: that the present holds a finer promise than the past with its shadows and dust. In an inversion of the obvious, perhaps even the Traveller obsession with cemetery maintenance itself supports this view. After all, isn’t the act of placing flowers on a tomb a gesture of bringing a little life back to the dead?After the fair at Horsmonden, I largely avoided gatherings of people, spending time in empty stopping places, visiting forlorn churches and well-kept graves. It is dawning on me that there is only so much I can learn from this. Another of Nan’s catchphrases comes to me: “There are no pockets in shrouds.” Perhaps this saying, a caution against overzealous pursuit of riches, masks a second meaning as well. There is a poverty to death a limit to how much a skeleton can teach you about a life it no longer knows.I realised how sparsely furnished my van was. Its naked pale blue surfaces stared at me like sheets of ice. For eight months, I had been travelling with what I thought were the bare essentials – bed, stove, wash gear, clothes and so forth. But there were other trappings of Romany life, when it was lived most richly: beautiful furnishings, gilded surfaces, portable pictures, talismans and silks. I’ve been missing a trick: the means by which a difficult life was rendered livable and even, at times, enviable.When I asked Mum for help, she looked happy, as if pleased that I’d finally grasped the meaning of life. She gave me armfuls of folded materials. There was an Islamic purple velvet hanging, edged with golden stitching and arranged in a pattern of teardrops matching Bedouin horse-cloths, constructed out of navy blue and orange-coloured diamond shapes of fabric brightly coloured Indian tapestry cloths: two square ones, and one in the shape of an arch. They shouted in bright yellows and blues and greens and pinks, with tiny mirrors stitched into them alongside little embroidered birds, stars, flowers, chakra wheels and Hindu swastikas. I decorated the van, clipping the cloths to the plywood lining with bulldog clips and larger, stronger, rubber-tipped market grips.The van was completely transformed. Its contents came together into a nomadic aesthetic all of its own ramshackle, yet somehow making happy sense as a whole. My gran and grandad – Mum’s parents – wandered over to see what I’d been doing. They seemed stunned, but in a good way: “Looks like an old vardo,” Grandad said, using the Traveller word for caravan. Gran remarked that the way I had hung the cloths reminded her of the inside of the Travellers’ square tents back when she was a little girl. Their approval came as a relief. I slammed the doors and smiled as I thought of the road ahead.• Follow the long read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.This is an edited extract from The Stopping Places by Damian Le Bas, published by Chatto \u0026amp Windus on 7 June.

You have called not witnesses from the Remain campaign or associated groups,” Banks wrote in a letter released on Twitter.The digital, culture, media and sport select committee said it would consider its response on Tuesday, and could seek a formal summons for Banks and Wigmore if they continue to refuse to appear, the second time it has done so in a week.Damian Collins, the committee’s chairman, tweeted that it was not only his committee “that has questions” for Banks and Wigmore, and said there were ongoing investigations by the Electoral Commission, the Information Commissioner and a court in Mississippi. Later Banks tweeted that “we have only delayed our appearance”.In his letter Banks accused the committee of colluding with a pro-remain campaign group called the Fair Vote Project, which has brought a legal action in the US, alleging that Leave.EU data was illegally sent abroad to be processed at the University of Mississippi. Banks denies the allegation and complained that the MPs had released evidence from a witness in that case early “in order to aid this group”.The Fair Vote Project said that it had brought the case to obtain an order to preserve data from Banks’s insurance company Eldon Insurance and a second company called Big Data Dolphins, “so that the authorities can investigate whether or not UK citizen data was processed improperly”.Kyle Taylor, the director of the Fair Vote Project, added: “If their claim that Eldon Insurance and Big Data Dolphins are not connected to Leave.EU is correct, why are they now claiming that a court case in Mississippi about these private companies affects their ability to appear before the DCMS select committee in their capacity as key figures in Leave.EU?”Dominic Cummings, Vote Leave’s campaign director, is already subject to a formal summons by June 20 before the same group of MPs after he repeatedly refused to agree to attend on the dates suggested, saying he wanted to wait for formal investigations from the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner to conclude."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c65d9317d79b98a0237c19fc138cfd774fc22024/0_81_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82987f6ffed6f70d7c75a0eb51fa54aa","title":"brexit brussels boffey covering europe","story":"’s Brussels bureau chief explains how the last 18 months have looked from the heart of European politicsBetween the ’s offices in Brussels, two floors above the Old Hack pub on one side of Boulevard Charlemagne and the headquarters of the European commission on the other, stand 28 EU flags, towering over the passing traffic and pedestrians. At the stroke of midnight here, on the evening of 29 March 2019, one of those fluttering flags will be lowered. My view of Jean-Claude Juncker’s hideous Berlaymont building will be a little less cluttered, and Britain will no longer be a member of the European Union.I arrived in Brussels nearly 18 months ago as the newspaper’s bureau chief, from where I’ve had the mixed blessing of watching close up the twists, turns and positively cringeworthy contortions on display in the Brexit talks. Whether an arch-Remoaner or a fervent hardline Brexiter, most followers of the process would agree that the UK’s extraction from Brussels is proving to be a singularly painful exercise. It is akin to a high-stakes poker game in which one player is always bluffing, is well known to be doing so, and is therefore, rather unsurprisingly, repeatedly exposed.The process is unlikely to become any more comfortable for the UK as we approach the formal withdrawal date, before entering and leaving a 21-month (or longer!) period of transition as a rule-taker, and then launching into a potentially endless argument, debate and deliberation about whether it was all worth it, and what to do now with our hard-fought freedom and global reach. If some in the Conservative party think that leaving the EU will put an end to its own internal agony over Britain’s place in Europe, I fear they will be deeply disappointed. As some people say in Switzerland, negotiations with the EU, once started, never truly come to an end.There is a lot of talk today about May’s lack of foresight in triggering those talks without having prepared a plan for the future. At the time, though, there was simply a lot of griping that it was taking so long to put in the letter and get the thing going. Nine months had passed before Sir Tim Barrow, Britain’s ambassador to the EU, handed it to Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, during which time the EU had refused to talk with Whitehall about Brexit, beyond a few logistical discussions. It was clear from there that these talks were going to be on the EU’s terms.So the great letter-giving was the point at which the proper talks, and reporting on them, could get going? No. Far from it. The prime minister, in her wisdom, called a general election a few weeks later.That announcement was certainly a shock in Britain, but in Brussels, it was welcome. Juncker, the president of the European commission, had even taken time out to privately lobby May in favour of calling it. For all of May’s election-campaign talk about Brussels loving the idea of a weak prime minister to exploit, in reality they wanted a strong one who could face down the Brexiters. Democratically enhanced, she could be open with the British public about the trade-offs and compromises that would be required. At the time the greatest fear in Brussels was that the orce bill (initially resisted, later settled at £39bn) would be used by some in the party to push the UK to walk out of the negotiations, prompting the hardest of all Brexits.Of course, once again neither May nor Brussels got what they wanted from the British voting public. But neither, it turns out, has it been the orce bill that has injected the greatest drama and danger into the talks. Of all the surprise bumps in the road, from the general election to the bizarre moment when it emerged that Spain intended to use the Brexit talks to progress their centuries-old ambitions over Gibraltar, the one that could still upend the whole thing is the issue of avoiding a border on the island of Ireland.It is this issue that encapsulates the central problem of Brexit. In leaving the single market, the customs union and the jurisdiction of the European court of justice, Britain has sealed its fate: there will have to be border checks between it and the club. If a border is to be avoided on the island of Ireland, Northern Ireland is in effect going to have to remain part of that club.That might seem dogmatic and unreasonable to some in the UK. And there is a danger, certainly, of a correspondent from the  in Brussels going native, given the paper’s editorial line and its doubts over the sagacity of the Johnsons and Goves of this world. But the EU kindly vaccinates against that. It isn’t so attractive a thing, close up, either. A startlingly white organisation, last year the European commission launched a ersity drive to recruit “women, staff with disabilities, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual and intersex (LGBTI) staff and older staff”, yet a spokesman was surprised, even indignant, when I asked why there was no mention of ethnic minority groups. Its decision to pay Turkey, and fund the Libyan coastguard, to keep refugees from crossing its border is full of moral hazard. The pandering to Viktor Orbán, the populist, anti-Islamic prime minister of Hungary – who is a member of the same pan-European political grouping as Juncker, Tusk and the German chancellor Angela Merkel – is pretty nauseating. The European parliament is full of showboaters, idle expense-spongers and a fair share of cranks. Meanwhile the commission’s handling of Britain’s negotiation requests can be rough to the point of outrageously rude, sometimes even self-defeating, with a smug smile never too far from some of the senior officials’ faces. After all, the UK’s humiliation has been a real career-enhancer for some. But perhaps it is only after sitting with EU officials and hearing them talk in lovingly protective terms about the “normative order” of the EU – the institutional and legal architecture that gives each of the member states the necessary trust in each other to keep on going – that one can understand quite how limited are the choices on both sides. You hear often from diplomats and officials that the talks aren’t a matter of punishing Britain. That is true, to a point. But what these talks certainly are about is not allowing the UK to disrupt a complex and evidently fragile architecture that has just about kept the peace between nations that do not have a great record in peacekeeping.When you are inside the club, you can play around with the rules a bit. Outside, the rulebook plays around with you. One of my most enjoyable articles to write while here was a piece comparing and contrasting today’s farce with Britain’s failed 1961-63 accession talks, which in the end were stopped short by General de Gaulle’s “non”. A 28-page account penned by the UK delegation – marked “secret” – had warned the prime minister Harold Macmillan that their counterparts had “insisted that our position was that of the demandeur” and the “existing rules must in principle be regarded as sacrosanct”. A better deal than that offered to members was not on the cards. It would, the UK officials subsequently complained to their political masters, “have been helpful if we could have formed a clearer view as to what would be negotiable” rather than put forward “proposals … which in the event proved quite unnegotiable”. It took a decade for Britain to rethink its approach, swallow it all, and join the club in 1973. To misquote Mark Twain: “There is no such thing as a new story”. Perhaps I’ll watch that 28th flag go back up again in a decade’s time too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad9d5b54d4aa798070af4c9c33839d1189df087b/0_105_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2d4b4598a808aa08621e6d757bc483d","title":"nicola sturgeon calls for scotland to be given powers over migration","story":"SNP leader will tell conference that hostile environment is harming country’s interests Nicola Sturgeon will make a plea for vital migration powers to be devolved to Scotland, as her newly elected party deputy, Keith Brown, called on independence supporters to “get ready” for a second referendum.Addressing delegates at the Scottish National party’s summer conference in Aberdeen on Saturday afternoon, Sturgeon will say: “Westminster’s hostile environment to migration is not just a slogan. It is has a real impact on our public services and our economy.” Noting that, since the Brexit vote in June 2016, there has been a significant drop in the number of EU nurses registering in the UK, the SNP leader and Scotland’s first minister will insist: “Scotland is a welcoming country – our prosperity and our public services depend on it. If Westminster cannot, or will not, act in our best interests, it is time that our own parliament was able to do so. It’s time for powers over migration to come to Scotland.” Earlier on Friday, Keith Brown was elected SNP deputy leader, following a ballot of the party’s 118,000 plus membership. Brown, who is the Scottish government’s economy secretary, told delegates that another referendum was “undoubtedly ahead”. “While we wait for clarity on Brexit ... the challenge is for all of us in the party and the wider Yes movement across Scotland to get ready.”The contest to replace former MP Angus Robertson as party deputy had been dominated by questions about the timing of another independence referendum. There have been several public skirmishes in recent months about whether Sturgeon should deploy the mandate for a new referendum that she claims from the 2016 Holyrood elections before the parliamentary term ends in 2021. Alternatively, she could delay until an unarguable economic case for independence has been built and public opinion is more favourable.Enjoying the sunshine on the east coast, both activists and politicians were buoyed by two pieces of research released overnight before the start of the conference. A poll for the Times found the SNP continuing to marshal a substantial lead in both Westminster and Holyrood voting intentions, despite being in government for more than a decade. The survey by YouGov gives the party a 13-point lead over the Tories and a 17-point lead over Labour at Westminster, while at Holyrood the lead is 14 over the Tories and 19 over Labour. The YouGov survey also found voters continuing to switch from Labour to the SNP, suggesting that the election of Corbyn ally Richard Leonard as Scottish Labour leader last November has yet to bolster the party’s fortunes. The SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, used his address to conference to accuse Labour of effectively colluding with the Tories by failing to provide a strong enough opposition to Theresa May’s plans for a hard Brexit. Challenging Jeremy Corbyn to ditch his “ludicrous” stance on Brexit, Blackford said: “Labour must join with us and give full support to staying in the single market and the customs union to mitigate against the risks of a hard Brexit.” The YouGov poll also revealed that Sturgeon’s personal approval ratings have slipped to -2, from an unprecedented +56 point positive rating around the time of the general election of 2015, when the SNP won 56 of 59 Scottish seats in a landslide victory.There will be no scheduled discussion during the main conference of the report from the party’s Sustainable Growth Commission, published last week. The report intended to provide a fresh economic prospectus for independence to overcome what many see as the failings of the 2014 campaign’s arguments around currency and jobs.The report, which attracted criticism from opponents as well as supporters on the left of the independence movement, was referenced at several fringe events. At a debate organised by the Institute for Economic Affairs, veteran former SNP MP George Kerevan described the report as “a little too conservative for my case”, saying “if you start risking people at the other end – the poor, the unemployed, the people stuck in dead-end jobs ... then what is independence for?” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28bf192e697b92251a929c2047030fa67011751c/0_312_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23c4a9e77f01f74b9ef37624dbb08c5b","title":"ageism widespread in uk study finds","story":"Ageism is rife in Britain, with millennials holding the most negative attitudes towards ageing, according to a study. Across all age groups, almost a third of people surveyed agreed with the statement “being lonely is just something that happens when people get old”, while two-thirds said they had no friends with an age gap of 30 years or more.“Ageist attitudes abound in society and have a major impact on the public’s health, and yet they are rarely treated with the seriousness they deserve,” said the RSPH chief executive, Shirley Cramer.“Too often ageist behaviour and language is trivialised, overlooked or even served up as the punchline to a joke – something we would rightly not tolerate with other forms of prejudice.”The study also found that half of women and a quarter of men said they felt pressure to stay looking young. The society called for a ban on use of the term “anti-ageing” in the cosmetics and beauty industry. “If we can begin to remove the stubborn barriers that reinforce societal ageism, we can expect many more to look forward to later life as a period of opportunity for growth and new experiences, rather than a set of mental and physical challenges,” Cramer said. In partnership with the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, the study surveyed ageist attitudes across 12 areas of life, revealing that the public are most ageist about appearance, memory loss and participation in physical and community activities. According to the RSPH, negative attitudes about ageing can become “a self-fulfilling prophecy”, with previous research showing that those with such attitudes live seven and a half years less on average, experience increased memory loss, have a greater risk of depression and anxiety, a reduced ability to recover from illness, less interest in diet and exercise and a more negative body image.  The RSPH called for the Independent Press Standards Organisation to include age in the editors’ code of practice to prevent discrimination. The report recommends housing nurseries and care homes under the same roof. “Intergenerational contact and care offer huge benefits for the groups involved, but also to the facilities’ operators,” it says, adding that it could be an opportunity for local authorities and private providers to save costs “as well as offering genuine wellbeing benefits to ‘young’ and ‘old’ customers alike”.

Thiem has beaten him twice on clay in the past 13 months, most recently in Madrid last month and, if there is to be a shock to top Cecchinato’s defeat of Djokovic in the quarter-finals, he has a fighting\u0026nbspchance.Nadal took two and a quarter hours to win 6-4, 6-1, 6-2 against Del Potro. But the snap had clearly drained from Del Potro’s wrists – which have endured multiple surgeries – and the Argentinian’s last shot sailed clear of the baseline by a good foot. He looked woebegone and immensely relieved.Nadal said: “If you lose, you lose. But I’m going to play with my highest passion, my love for the sport. I have a lot of injuries and I know the years are going quick. I love the competition, I love the sport. If it was not that way, I would not be here.“It was a good second and third set for me. Sunday is the day to give my best, increase even a little bit more the level. In the first set, he was serving big. Every time I served, I was having problems. I gave him too many chances. If I don’t play well against Dominic, it’s almost impossible. He will be a big challenge. I believe I can have my chances.”Thiem, the bustling Austrian regarded second only to Nadal on clay, must take the confidence of his successes against the world No\u0026nbsp1 into the final to stop his opponent turning these championships into a personal benevolent fund. In winning 10 titles since 2005, Nadal has taken away nearly $17m (£12.7m) in prize money, a fifth of his career earnings. That could grow by €2.2m (£1.9m) on Sunday – or a not inconsiderable €1.12m (£980,000) for second place.For Thiem, this is more than a numbers game, though. It is an assault on his self-belief, and he sounds mentally rock solid, even if his legs may be telling him a different story.Beyond argument, Thiem had the tougher Friday. It was a curious affair, though – for reasons that had little to do with the match itself. It was impossible to tell if it was the weight of the moment or the loose-hanging threads of his past that most discomforted Cecchinato. For long stretches of the two hours and 17 minutes it took Thiem to eke out the victory, the first semi-final was loaded with unspoken darkness.The odds on an exonerated match-fixer reaching the final of a grand slam might normally be a million to one. Yet, for nearly two hours, Cecchinato, the 25-year-old Italian, played his third heroic match of the tournament to push logic to its limit.Two years ago he beat an 18-month suspension and a €40,000 fine for his part in a 2015 match-fixing scandal in Morocco on a technicality. On day 13 of the championships – his lucky number, as it happens – that dagger hung over tennis until Thiem cut him down in the afternoon sun.The affable loser would not talk about it earlier in the tournament, and he was allowed the grace of not having to after a spirited fighting exit. Pity drowned moralism, for once. But his story has been as embarrassing for the game as it has for the player. Nobody saw any of this coming when Cecchinato’s name appeared in the draw. Nor did many alarm bells ring when he escaped from the first round in a tense five-setter against the unseeded Romanian Marius Copil. Then, with a boom that echoed around the game, he dumped Djokovic out of the tournament, and found himself staring out from centre stage.Playing more freely after surviving two tough sets, Thiem raced to the finish. With the improbable quickly curdling into the impossible, Cecchinato’s happy head dropped and his legs dragged.Perhaps it was the same sort of resignation that had consumed him the day in Morocco three years ago when he lost in straight sets to the world No\u0026nbsp338, Kamil Majchrzak, at odds of 7-1, gratefully snapped up by a friend. Or maybe not.Cecchinato does not want to talk about that. A lot of people do not. The Tennis Integrity Unit would only say in reply to the  on Friday: “In line with TIU confidentiality policy, we are not making any comment on Cecchinato.”Many in the crowd shouted “Marco! Marco!” as he departed, banging his right fist on his heart and soaking up more adulation than he can have had in all eight years as a pro. He leaves Paris headed for Eastbourne and Wimbledon €560,000 richer than when he arrived. And he did try his heart out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b17b5d8a75b98c8b120ff7219394edb903531730/0_203_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf428374e9f10e196227fe92109a5ae2","title":"jeff horn misses first weigh in but makes second for terence crawford bout","story":"Australian boxer survives initial scare after clocking above the limit, despite taking off his clothesJeff Horn has managed to make the weight on his second attempt for his mandatory WBO welterweight championship defence against Terence Crawford.Horn clocked in at exactly 147 pounds (66.67kg) – right on the limit – at the weigh-in on Saturday morning (AEST) at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, where the bout will take place.Earlier, Horn clocked in at 148 pounds (67.13kg) at the weigh-in. He then stripped naked and was at 147.5 pounds (66.9kg) – still over the 147 pound (66.67kg) welterweight limit. He was then given one hour to come under that number.• Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every dayHe eventually made it – much to the relief of his shocked camp – and will now take on Crawford on Sunday (AEST).Crawford had no such weight troubles, tipping the scales at 146.6 pounds (66.45kg), ahead of what will be his first fight in this ision, having won titles in two other weight classes.On Friday, Horn appeared to be even more confident of victory after finally seeing Crawford in the flesh and shrugging off his attempts to intimidate the Australian.Crawford asked Horn if he was ready during a near minute-long staredown following their official pre-fight media conference on Friday morning (AEST) – the first time they’ve crossed paths.“I was like, ‘yeah I’m ready, are you ready?’ He said, ‘hell yeah I’m ready,’” Horn said.There were no major fireworks, nor was there any trouble between trainers Glenn Rushton and Brian McIntyre, who have been at each other’s throats for several months.Sporting a flashy blue suit, Horn cut a relaxed figure as Rushton did his best to dispel myths about his charge’s reputation in the US as a rugged fighter with only average technical skills.Crawford and McIntyre didn’t say much but when they did, they took on a soft, menacing tone – or at least tried to.“He might get hurt,” Crawford said of Horn, who has been installed as a rank outsider to retain his WBO welterweight title on Sunday.“Pressure breaks pipes. A lot of people came in the ring with me with strong will and they left with their tail tucked in.”Horn looked physically the bigger man but Crawford said the incumbent WBO champion would end up “surprised” by his strength and power.McIntyre predicted it would be the start of a “takeover” in the welterweight ision by the unbeaten Crawford, who is stepping up to the 66.67kg limit after winning titles in two lower weight classes – including all four junior welterweight belts.“Jeff just happens to be the first victim,” he said.None of it appeared to faze Horn and laughs broke out from his support section whenever the American pair’s words occasionally fell flat.“I found it entertaining, to be honest. They’re trying to get in my head ... it was hilarious,” he said.Rushton said: “There’s nothing that they said at all that caused me any discomfort whatsoever.”“In fact I actually feel a lot more relaxed now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8696ed173e50b5fd61abaee1f9ff902f05f51f1c/0_75_3194_1916/master/3194.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da1e41789ac21505203b204417fc26df","title":"doug stanhope review brixton academy","story":"Brixton Academy, LondonOne of the sharpest minds and loosest cannons in comedy is back with material about rape, race and #MeToo“Is it wrong to use racism to try and stop gang rape?”American standup Doug Stanhope is back in the UK and, yes, that sound you can hear is sacred cows bellowing. This near two-hour set showcases the best, and flirts with the worst, of this bleakest, blackest comic. Sometimes it is grim, sometimes you’ve just got to hold your nerve, and occasionally it’s thrilling to be back in a room with one of the sharpest minds and loosest cannons in comedy.Take the opening five minutes. First, Stanhope – jaded as ever – recites the public apology he anticipates having to issue after the show. Then he ventures a comparison between comedians and magicians, the former infinitesimally less fraudulent than the latter. At once romantic and cynical, it’s an exemplary Stanhope joke – and this is just housekeeping before the gig proper. There follows a precis of his world-tour experiences so far, featuring wisecracks about Vietnamese currency (“Can’t we just make it a dong ninety-nine?”) and a gloriously childish riff on the law against insulting the Thai king.The two most eyecatching routines concern gang rape in India and Stanhope’s take on #MeToo. In both, he takes up highly provocative positions, then brings arguments into play to see if these stances can be defended. Some audiences may never get over their initial distaste. For others there is a certain appalled pleasure to be had at Stanhope’s devilry, bloody-mindedness and scorn for piety and groupthink wherever he finds them.He paints a dismal portrait of his own life haunting airport hotels, guzzling pizza before booze “the same way they stack sandbags before a flood”. One skit about his disgust at old people tips into ugliness for its own sake. His section on children’s deaths isn’t much fun either. And yet, making fun, insists Stanhope in a broadside against humourlessness, is all we’ve got: our only defence against life’s brutality.

Here’s how to enjoy them without spending too much cashEven the epic photos don’t quite prepare you for Santorini, with its encircling black cliffs. The island was formed by an enormous volcanic eruption in 1600 BC, and the subsequently collapsing caldera formed these sheer faces. Its extraordinary landscapes justly attract hordes of visitors and, unsurprisingly, Santorini, or Thira in Greek, is one of the pricier Greek isles.Stay The island’s volcanic soil produces renowned wine, and at Caveland caves dug from the volcanic pumice to be used as wine cellars now provide fun and stylish accommodation. Dorm beds cost from €23, doubles (book ahead: they sell out quickly) from €70.Hang out Atlantis in the north-western town of Oia may just be the best bookshop on the planet it certainly has one of the best settings, overlooking the sea in this whitewashed old town. Born through passion, and a bit of whimsy, it now runs food, film and literary festivals through the year.Eat Naoussa calls itself a traditional taverna, although its prices are a little high. The food is good, though, and factor in the location (its terrace is a good place to watch the sun set over the caldera) and it’s a bargain (main courses from €10.50).Day trip Boat trips run to Thirasia, another sliver of the island before its eruption, on the other side of the caldera. If you can, bring a moped, stay the night and explore what Santorini must have been like 30 years ago (there are a few old-style rooms to let from €40 for a double).Way to go There is an airport (served by easyJet and Norwegian from Gatwick), but though it’s a longish ferry trip from Athens (6-9 hours, greeceferries, from €40), nothing beats entering the caldera by sea. It does leave you with the problem of making your way up the cliffs on the switchback road. A donkey ride is traditional, if not exactly comfortable. Andy BostockMost people, if asked to imagine a Greek island, will probably picture Mykonos – all whitewashed houses and sparkling turquoise seas (although the island’s vibrant nightlife is renowned, too). Its fame, and the famous people who visit, mean prices can be eye-popping. But it is possible to enjoy Mykonos on a budget, especially outside of August.Stay A basic double room in Hora, the main town, can cost €150-200, even in June. There are lower prices out of town and under canvas. On the south coast 6km away, Paraga Beach, says it welcomes “young people of all ages” and has comfortable “prefab” tents in a gorgeous spot right by the sea for €40 a night in June (€30 all summer for those with their own tent).Hang out Mykonos nightlife can be hectic a more peaceful option is Cine Manto , an outdoor cinema in a lovely oasis of a garden with a caferestaurant and screenings (adult €9) at 9pm and 11pm in summer.Eat Finding cheap, but good, food is always possible in Greece. A gyros pitta (traditionally pork, chicken, or lamb) for a few euros may be reminiscent of a kebab back home, but done well they’re sublime. Try one with a glass of wine in nice surroundings at Pepper in Mykonos town.Day trip It’s a 30-minute ferry ride to the Sanctuary of Apollo on the sacred isle of Delos (€20 return plus €12 entry). Pack a picnic and drink in the atmosphere.Way to go The cheapest and best way to approach a Greek island is as Odysseus did – by sea. A ferry from either Athens port takes around four hours and costs €29. ABCroatia’s sunniest island has also developed a reputation as party central: the authorities are trying to clamp down on badly behaved tourists and prices in the cocktail bars of Hvar Town have shot through the roof. But there’s more to this lavender-scented island than its busiest town: check out the relaxed and reasonably priced town of Stari Grad, which dates back to ancient Greek days, or even smaller Jelsa and Vrboska, also along the north coast.Stay Hidden House in Stari Grad (doubles from £89 B\u0026ampB) is an elegant little B\u0026ampB with four exquisite bedrooms.Hang out Walk east about a kilometre from Vrboska through pine forest to reach Soline, a pebbly beach in a shaded cove (not to be confused with a naturist beach on the other side of the narrow peninsula). Set back in the woods is the simple Restaurant Soline, where you can fill up on pizzas and grilled dishes.Eat Fun and affordable Cafe Antika is in a 16th-century Stari Grad house with an interior that resembles your grandmother’s sitting room, and outside tables spilling into courtyards and out on to the street. A dinner of gilled sea bass is about £10.Day trip Get sublime views of Hvar Town from the top of the Venetian fortress, Fortica Španjola. It’s worth the £3.50 admission.Way to go Split is the nearest airport, and ferries and catamarans run to Stari Grad and Hvar Town.Mary NovakovichOff limits to tourists until 1989, when it stopped being a military base, the sleepy island of Vis may be about to go stratospheric thanks to its location in the upcoming Mamma Mia! film sequel. For now, the atmosphere is still wonderfully laid-back: there still isn’t a single nightclub on the island, although restaurant prices have crept upwards.Stay Townhouse Vis (from €95–€150 a night, sleeps six, four-night minimum) is just a few metres from the waterfront in Vis Town and has three bedrooms and a fully equipped kitchen.Hang out Tucked into a deep cove in north-eastern Vis is beautiful Stončica beach, surrounded by lush vegetation, which is a good spot for snorkelling. Waterside Konoba Stončica serves simple grilled seafood and meat, and a lovely octopus salad for about €10.Eat Gostiona Vis, which is sometimes known by its previous name, Buffet Vis, is right on the waterfront in Vis Town and serves grilled fish and seafood from about £11.Day trip It’s probably the priciest thing you’ll do, but catching a boat to the island of Biševo to explore the extraordinary Blue Grotto is irresistible. Between 11am and 1pm, the light turns the water an impossible shade of electric blue. In high summer it can be bedlam, so come at 10am for slightly less vivid hues it’s calmer in June or September. Alternatura has trips from €18pp.Way to go Fly to Split, from various UK airports: from here it’s a two-hour ferry trip, or 90 minutes by catamaran. MNHolidays in Corsica tend to cost more than in mainland France but the beaches are some of the best in Europe, the food sensational and the local festivals spectacular. Around eight million visitors come to enjoy its wild landscapes and stunning coastline each year, most of them French.Stay Hotel La Palma (doubles from €75 room-only in June), a half-hour drive from Bastia airport, has 18 rooms and is close to vineyards and the beaches near Saint Florent. Patrimonio’s annual open-air guitar festival takes place in late July.Hang out For turquoise water, and white sand without crowds, head to Lozari beach, just east of L’Ile Rousse. Laze on the sand, swim, walk to the ruins of the hilltop Genoese watchtower and have lunch at Vava’u Chez Taté (grilled fish, octopus and seafood salads from around €10).Eat For plates of baked mussels and langoustines, and maybe the best pizzas on the island, try A Tana (+33 4 9538 7118), above the port in Bastia, with a vaulted dining room and a few outside tables. It has seafood pastas and pizzas (€8-€10), Corsican beer, local wines and the warm-heartedness of a restaurant that is always full.Day trip Half an hour’s drive from Porto-Pollo on Corsica’s west coast is Filitosa (adult €7), a stunning 8,000-year-old megalithic settlement of carved granite menhirs.Way to go EasyJet flies to Ajaccio from Gatwick, and to Bastia from Gatwick, Manchester and Stansted. Ferries run to Corsica from Nice, Marseille and Toulon.Jon BryantWith cobbled streets, white houses, bobbing sailing boats and donkeys in trousers (originally to protect them from mosquitoes), 30km-long Île de Ré has long been a favourite with Parisians. Safe and civilised, it’s a great family destination, with good seafood and cycle rides to the beach. Use markets and bakeries and a trip needn’t break the bank. Stay The island is a camper’s dream. Camping Le Cormoran (€19.50 for a two-person pitch, €69 for a four-person pre-erected tent) has a kids’ club and aquapark. Hotel P’tit Dej (doubles from €79 B\u0026ampB in June) has rooms and family apartments, and a pool.Hang out Trousse-Chemise beach at the western end of the island is backed by pine forest and has a great bar, La Cabane de la Patache, for seafood and galettes. The beach is popular with kitesurfers when the wind picks up and at low tide a huge sandbar appears.Eat Les Copains Bâbord (seafood platters for €12) near La Flotte is an oyster hut with seaview deck, owned by the Le Corre family, who have farmed oysters here for 50 years.Day trip Cycle from the Loix salt plans to the lighthouse, Le Phare des Baleines (€3.50) at the island’s western tip. Bikes from Yootoo cost €11 a day, €19 three days. Way to go Saint-Malo ferry port is a five-hour drive from the island. EasyJet and Ryanair fly from eight UK airports to nearby La Rochelle, or the train there from Paris takes three hours (a toll bridge connects the city to Île de Ré). JBFew places have such a shape-shifting reputation as this sleepy islejet-set retreatstag party capital. But in the rural north, life has continued in a bucolic way. This Ibiza is better defined by local gastronomy and culture, and the quiet pleasures of Balearic life.Stay Ibiza is doable on a budget if you camp. Camping Cala Nova in Santa Eulalia has tent pitches for two for €23 in June, tipis from €35, and bungalows from €70 (both sleeping two adults and two kids). Camping La Playa, a mile or so south, adds gaily painted vintage caravans, yoga classes, live music and a here-for-the-season hippy vibe: caravans from €386 a week in June, cabins more than double that tent pitches also available.Hang out Take a picnic to a beach that involves a little scrambling, such as Sant Josep, Es Portitxo or Cala Llentrisca.Eat At ramshackle El Bigotes (book ahead) in Cala Mastella, there are two sittings: for fish at 12pm and bullit de peix (fish stew with potatoes) at 2pm (€20 a head). Or cycle inland to Bar Costa in Santa Gertrudis for bocadillos with jamón for a few euros.Day trip Nothing beats hiring a bike to explore inland and the less visited calas of the north and north-east coast. Kandani in Santa Eulalia hires bikes from €15 a day and electric bikes from €35.Way to go In summer there are direct flights from most UK airports.Sorrel DownerWestern Sicily is less well-known than the east, but similarly endowed with wonderful beaches and charming towns. Foreign tourists rarely go west from Palermo, but it is worth venturing off the beaten track. The prices are lower, too.Stay In Palermo, A Casa di Amici is a boutique hostel in the centre (€20-€60pp for private rooms, less for dorms).

As the former Sex and the City star arrived for a campaign event in Buffalo, New York this week she was greeted by a phalanx of placard-wielding supporters of her opponent, the incumbent governor of the state, Andrew Cuomo.“Cynthia go home,” one poster said, which was a bit rough given the almost 400-mile journey she’d just made from her home in New York City. “This is upstate – nice of you to find it,” said a snarky second. Another said: “Next stop Ithica.”“Very unfortunate,” Nixon conceded as she was quizzed about the gaffe at the event in Buffalo. And for good measure she correctly enunciated every letter: “B.U.F.F.A.L.O.”Hiccups are perhaps only to be expected for a first-time candidate who cut her teeth on the stage, found fame through the small screen and has never before run for elected office. But what is most surprising about Cynthia Nixon’s audacious attempt to unseat Cuomo from the governorship he has occupied for the past eight years is how surefooted it feels.Nixon is positioning herself boldly as the true progressive voice for New York. She calls her campaign a “people-powered insurgency”, fueled by small donors in contrast to Cuomo’s top-down bid for re-election with its $30m war chest, and her rhetoric is as targeted as much against the machine politics of New York’s dominant Democratic party as it is against Donald Trump. She has cut his polling lead from 47 points in March to 22 last month.“We have a governor here in Andrew Cuomo who is not a progressive and is barely a Democrat,” Nixon told the  in Buffalo, New York state’s second largest city. “If he wanted true progressive change he would have done it already – you can’t just play progressive in the months leading up to an election.”If this sounds familiar, it is: Nixon channels more than a little of Bernie Sanders. As a framing for the Nixon versus Cuomo battle, think Sanders versus Hillary Clinton – the radical outlier versus the establishment favourite. She puts it another way: David versus Goliath.Unlike Sanders, who ran before Trump was ascendant, Nixon has the benefit of the post-Trump bounce that is lifting her up as part of a nationwide resistance. “With Donald Trump in the White House we are going in completely the wrong direction,” she told the . “This is a terrible moment for our country, but it is also an opportunity: we are incentivized as never before in my lifetime to make progressive change.”As a further boost, she sees her campaign as part of a related nationwide surge of radical female candidates who are shaking up the Democratic party – most recently in the figure of Stacey Abrams who is vying in Georgia to become America’s first black female governor. “Trump has been a wake-up call for women all across the country who believe, as I believe, that if we want change we have to go out and make it happen ourselves by running for office,” Nixon said.One of the interesting aspects of Nixon’s bid to become New York’s first female governor is her relationship to her own celebrity. She studiously avoids all reference to it – you will hear no mention of SATC in her campaign literature or in her stump speeches.But being a household name is an undeniable advantage in modern politics – not every rookie candidate is given a platform on The Daily Show or endorsed by the Nation – and though she doesn’t labour the point, nor does she run from it. When the  caught up with her at a campaign stop on the New York City subway, where she was berating Cuomo for the diabolical state of mass transit in the metropolis over which he presides, she smiled broadly and shook the hands of passengers who were palpably star-struck in her presence.“I love you!” several riders said, stopping to take selfies with her. But an equal number were complimentary not towards Nixon as Miranda but towards Nixon as would-be governor. “I really like what you’re saying about the subway,” a male passenger said. “I’m a teacher and I’m really appreciative of what you’re trying to do for us,” a woman said.That delicate balance of making the most of her fame without playing to it is more complicated in upstate New York, where voters have a more skeptical approach towards stardom. Though they share the same identity as New Yorkers, the 9 million residents of New York City and the 11 million residents of the rest of the state are in some ways chalk and cheese: voters in economically struggling upstate and western regions of New York state view the city dwellers as “flatlanders” and can scoff at their fashion trends and perceived glamour.“That show, it did a lot to harm family values in this country,” said a man in Buffalo who asked not to be named, referring to Sex and the City.As Nixon builds her campaign ahead of the Democratic primary election against Cuomo in September she is counting on the likelihood that most voters who bother to turn up – whether in the city or in upstate communities like Buffalo – will be committed progressives who will be receptive to her left-leaning pitch. And she believes that her long record of voluntary work, especially as an advocate for public schools, will speak louder than any of Cuomo’s attacks on her for being unqualified or lightweight.“Cynthia is a very down-to-earth, accessible person who really understands people. She connects to people, then links that to policy and what needs to happen,” said Billy Easton, who worked closely with her at the Alliance for Quality Education where he is executive director.In Buffalo she certainly talked the liberal talk as she addressed an art gallery full of activists. During two hours of discussion with about 50 local people she ticked off all the subjects dearest to American progressives’ hearts. As governor she would: address racial and economic inequality and empower people in their communities increase taxes on the super-wealthy to pay for it decriminalize marijuana possession as one of many steps towards emptying out prisons extend rights for undocumented immigrants increase protections for LGBTQ people invest in public education toughen rent laws and combat gentrification fight corruption and end the overweening influence of corporate money in politics.The list may verge on the predictable, but long before she gets to the polling stations it is already having an impact. A discernible pattern has emerged – dubbed the “Cynthia effect” by pundits – whereby she proposes a new leftist policy one day and Cuomo responds with his own version of it the next. You see that with marijuana, where the sitting governor resolutely opposed legalisation until Nixon launched her campaign and then within weeks switched to supporting it. He passively accommodated the bizarre situation whereby seven Democratic state senators side with the Republicans, maintaining a conservative grip on state government, until Nixon declared her run – and then he moved swiftly to reunite the party. He opposed giving the right to vote to 40,000 people with criminal convictions, then did a U-turn once Nixon was in the race.Cuomo’s kneejerk reactions to Nixon’s goading should not be confused with political weakness – the wily and cunning incumbent is very far from conceding defeat. But the responses do suggest signs that we now have game on.And as Nixon stresses, she’s not in this contest just for the “Cynthia effect”. She’s here for one reason alone: “I’m in this to win.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7df857c2184304c60b0df91974759857743bb62/0_274_4104_2462/master/4104.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63e875126968fe55fcec8d703ba9121a","title":"g7 summit canada remote locations","story":"Charlevoix, Quebec, is beautiful, isolated ... and perfect for world leaders worried about mass protestsUntil the leaders of the seven most economically advanced nations in the world descended on it, the Charlevoix region of Quebec was perhaps best known for the beauty of its landscapes and the opulence of its state-run casino in La Malbaie. It is also a remote tourist destination, reached by way of an often perilous one-lane highway, and has a population density lower than the (already sparse) national average.This is no coincidence. Though it poses certain logistical issues, Charlevoix’s isolation is perhaps its greatest asset when it comes to staging a meeting of these world leaders. In an era where mass protests of such things are a given, Charlevoix offers a key security feature: it is difficult for protesters to get there, harder still to circulate and near impossible to escape the eye of law enforcement.“One way in, one way out,” says Alan Bell, president of the Toronto-based security consulting firm Global Risk International. “If you go back to some recent G7 and G20 meetings, the downtown core always gets trashed. What they want to do is zero in on the protesters. If they want to come, they basically have to walk in.”The practice of holding such huge and consequential meetings in hard-to-reach places is relatively new. The first G6 summit was held in 1975 in the Parisian exurb of Rambouillet. The meeting was a low-key affair that dealt almost exclusively in global economic matters. Protests were non-existent the only delay, it seems, was a result of the Soviet general secretary Leonid Brezhnev’s perpetual exhaustion, according to news clippings of the day. Canada, which joined the group in 1976, held subsequent G7 meetings in Ottawa (in 1981) Toronto (in 1988) and Halifax in 1995. (Russia was admitted in 1998.)Everything changed with the teargas-drenched spectacle known as “the Battle of Seattle”. In 1999, 60,000 protesters demonstrated at the meeting of the World Trade Organization, fomenting what has become an enduring anti-globalization movement.This large and diffuse group of trade unionists, NGOs, workers and black bloc members managed to disrupt the proceedings. The ensuing damage, and the images of police phalanxes doing battle with mostly unarmed protesters, were a headache for the city, law enforcement and world leaders alike.“World leaders were taken off guard. A lot of planning and organization went into the protests, and it all aligned in Seattle,” says Barry Eidlin, an assistant professor of sociology at McGill University in Montreal. “The retreat from the city is itself a response to these mass mobilization tactics.”The G8 meetings held in Canada since Seattle have taken place in Kananaskis, Alberta, and Muskoka, Ontario – like Charlevoix, remote locations to which access can be tightly controlled. In Charlevoix, a designated red zone restricts entrance to residents and summit participants, with a larger fenced-in “green zone” surrounding it, accessible only to those with accreditation. Beyond this is the white zone, the notable home to the summit’s so-called “free speech zone” where protesters can vent – 2km from where Donald Trump and his six peers will gather. The summit and associated meetings will cost Canadian taxpayers more than $600m.In 2010, Toronto provided a Canadian cautionary tale to the pitfalls of urban-held trade meetings. That year, police “kettled” more than 1,000 protesters –corralling then holding them outdoors for hours on end during a torrential downpour. It led to the high-profile disciplining of a senior Toronto police officer and an enduring black eye for the force.There probably won’t be a similar event this weekend. Though there have already been limited protests in Quebec City, a massive police presence and the sheer distance to Charlevoix has apparently dulled the outrage.Of course, those who would like to hark back to the old days of protest-free trade meetings can look forward to the 2020 G20 summit in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, where access is all but impossible given foreigners need permission to visit, and free expression is often outlawed completely."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Varadkar has had triumphs including the referendum, but mistakes are regrettedRape and assault claims in northeast care facility trigger three seperate investigationsIn Crumlin Boxing Club, Phil Sutcliffe has been coaching medal winners for many yearsLetter from volunteers calls for clarity in \u0026lsquoplain English\u0026rsquo on steps scout body is takingSecond Trinity maple felled this week because of disease, but air pollution not a factorFears over threats and attacks if Brexit leads to physical Border with SouthReview to be carried out under auspices of the Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsChair of inquiry into alleged smear campaign says people\u0026rsquos reliance on privilege a \u0026lsquosmokescreen\u0026rsquoTeenager had just completed second year at Moville Community CollegeActivists said plan to assist women in North with abortions is \u0026lsquoof great concern\u0026rsquoVaradkar meets Orange Order and says he is a \u0026lsquoneighbour not an invader\u0026rsquoPatrick McMahon (39) remembered as a kind father who had \u0026lsquoa great sense of fun\u0026rsquoSpecial Criminal Court agreed to relaxation of bail for 61-year-old accused of false imprisonment and threatening to kill\u0026Oacute R\u0026iacuteord\u0026aacutein says having trained personnel to respond to situations would help address issueBrown trout and other species killed in prime spawning tributary of Robe RiverThomas Fox (31) and siblings Regina (41) and Jonathan Keogh (32) on trial over Hutch killingJoseph Rafferty said he thought a friend had been having an affair with his wife and he heard voices in his head\u0026lsquoYou started quite a while ago when enthusiasm for Joyce was not as strong as now\u0026rsquoNew Testament \u0026lsquounambiguously regards homosexual activity as contrary to nature\u0026rsquo"},{"url":null,"title":"dramatic near misses at level crossings caught on cctv","story":"  June 7, 2018Rail operators call for vigilance on International Level Crossing Safety Awareness Day "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3524453.1528496346!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"senior scouts upset at way controversy handled","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSeveral Dublin county commissioners have distributed a letter asking local troops to back a statement saying they were “completely upset and dissatisfied” with how Scouting Ireland has dealt with the controversy.There is growing ision in Scouting Ireland between the grassroots and senior management over the handling of the safeguarding controversy, which has resulted in the suspension of their State funding.Several Dublin county commissioners have distributed a letter asking local troops to back a statement saying they were “completely upset and dissatisfied” with how Scouting Ireland has dealt with the controversy.Brendan Doyle, commissioner for Mountpelier Scout County in south-west Dublin, said the membership were angry at the lack of information being provided.“Volunteers have been left in positions telling parents and friends about what is happening, and not having all the information,” he said, adding members were only learning of details in the media.In April, Minister for Children Katherine Zappone suspended all State funding, worth nearly €1 million a year, over Scouting Ireland’s mishandling of a rape allegation made in 2016.There was considerable frustration that a barrister’s review into the actions of four senior volunteers who stepped aside over the controversy was not finished, despite initially being expected to be completed by late May, Mr Doyle said.The commissioners’ statement, obtained by The , criticised how Scouting Ireland “communicated and dealt with the current issues surrounding our organisation”. It called for clarity about what steps the organisation was taking “in plain English so as to allay growing fears and rumours”.The Dublin scout province is made up of nine “counties”each representing several local troops, and each county has a commissioner.Mr Doyle said he believed Scouting Ireland chief executive Dr John Lawlor should resign over how the organisation responded to the public controversy. “Accountability at the top” was needed.In January a confidential report by safeguarding expert Ian Elliott found the handling of the 2016 rape allegation was “deeply flawed.” Four senior volunteers criticised in Mr Elliott’s report temporarily stepped aside, including the chief scout Christy McCann.There is still strong support for Mr McCann, who stepped aside a number of days after 623 delegates out of 773 voted to re-elect him as head of the organisation at their national council.Garrett Flynn, former board member and chairman of 115th Ballinteer scout group, said there was a sense from a lot of members the volunteers who stepped aside “have been shafted.” There was sympathy for Mr McCann who many felt had been “caught in the crossfire” of the controversy, he said.To address Ms Zappone’s concerns, Scouting Ireland committed to speed up a long planned reform of their governance structure, which included bringing in independent board directors.The letter from Dublin commissioners called for a planned ballot on the reforms at a June egm to be postponed, until after the barrister inquiry was finished and had been circulated in full to the membership.The youth organisation held a townhall meeting on Thursday in the Red Cow Moran hotel, to discuss the reforms. The organisation has funding to last until mid-June, then it will quickly run into financial difficulties."},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord it took 35 years to build this stunning result","story":"Thirty-five years after it was placed into the Constitution, the electorate voted for the Eighth Amendment to be repealed and for provision be made for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day.

Photograph: John ThysAFPGetty ImagesThe extension of the mooted Northern Ireland backstop on an all-UK basis proposed by prime minister Theresa May will not be possible, the UK was told on Friday.The British proposals are a means of avoiding the need for post-Brexit customs controls between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, but the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier made clear on Friday that the special arrangements for Northern Ireland, which would see it remain part of the EU’s customs zone, “were devised for the specific situation of Northern Ireland”.They were “exceptional” measures to safeguard the frictionless border in the context of the Belfast Agreement and cross-Border co-operation, he said.“Our backstop cannot apply to the whole UK,” he said, also insisting that the backstop could not be a “temporary, time-limited” option.“Northern Ireland would form part of our customs territory – what is feasible for a territory the size of Northern Ireland is not necessarily feasible with the whole UK,” he said.The backstop agreed between the EU and UK last December provides for regulatory alignment between the Republic and the North in order to avoid customs checks. It would come into effect in the absence of a wider Brexit deal providing for a frictionless Border.Mr Barnier was briefing journalists in Brussels following this week’s Brexit talks and in response to the publication on Thursday of the the UK paper on a “temporary customs arrangement” solution to the Northern Ireland backstop issue.He welcomed the paper and what he said was the engagement of the UK in drafting text for the Withdrawal Treaty. He said he was not ruling out any of its proposals but it “raised more questions than answers”.He also said the “UK recognises that the proposals in its paper cannot qualify as a backstop since the issue of full regulatory alignment is not addressed. We need regulatory alignment to avoid a hard border”.Alluding to the reality that regulatory ergence between the North and the rest of the UK could mean controls on the Irish Sea, he argued that “checks carried out on ferries are less disruptive than at customs posts along 500km of the Northern Ireland Border”. Similar checks were already in operation, he said.And he spoke of what he called an “all-weather agreement” on the backstop – “a guarantee that will function in all circumstances”, whether or not a broader trade agreement was reached between the UK and the EU. “A Backstop means a backstop” and a “temporary backstop does not correspond to what we and Ireland need”, he said.Mr Barnier said that he was confident that he would be able to present to the EU summit at the end of the month evidence of progress on a number of fronts and emphasised that there would not be the same requirement of “sufficient progress” that previous summits had sought.He emphasised the absolute requirement for full agreement on the orce treaty, the Withdrawal Agreement, by October, playing down the significance of what has been seen as a June deadline.Among the issues which have seen progress this week, Mr Barnier said, were practical measures to co-ordinate North-South regulatory alignment in areas such as agriculture, environment and electricity supply.In the Withdrawal Agreement strand of talks there were still three main areas of disagreement: on elements of preserving citizens rights post-Brexit, on the future recognition of “geographical indicators” – the special designations of regional products, on which British proposals have not yet been received – and on governance issues, specifically the role of the European Court of Justice.But he expressed exasperation that “in all the British papers we have received there is a thread of continuity that is quite paradoxical given that this country has itself chosen to leave the EU”. The UK still seems to wanted to maintain all the benefits of membership, he said, and when the EU replied “that these are simply not available to those outside”, some tried to blame the union for the problem . “I will not be pressurised by this form of blame game.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3524349.1528486313!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit analysis barnier lays waste to uk plan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier speaks during a media conference at EU headquarters in Brussels on Friday. Photograph: Olivier HosletPool Photo via APThe headline of one tabloid screamed “Brexit back on course”.The polite reception in Brussels – and Dublin –\u0026nbspfor the UK’s latest Brexit paper on the “backstop”, prompted by relief that at last they had something to talk about, led some optimists in London to the view that a robust UK had pulled one over on Brussels.When Brexit secretary David Davis meets the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier on Monday morning for the next talks round, he will find that the gloves have come off.And he will be rapidly disabused of the hope that all the UK had to do to win brownie points for effort at the end of June summit was to demonstrate a plausible willingness to address the backstop issue. No-one really expected them to resolve the issue, they believe.That hurdle passed, the summer would allow them to engage in chasing the real prize, a comprehensive EU-UK agreement on their future relationship that would make the politically embarrassing backstop agreement redundant. It is only there, after all, to provide a guaranteed fallback should no other deal be done. Barnier on Friday made clear that that strategy would not wash. For a start the UK document paper can not be described as a plausible attempt at addressing the issue. Politely, he demolished it brick by brick.Crucially, he explained, member states were prepared to make an exceptional case of the North, waving common EU rules and practises for the first and last time, to preserve the frictionless Border and the Belfast Agreement. Such privileges were not on offer to the rest of the UK by virtue, not of malice, but its decision to leave the union. To imagine you could simply extend the backstop provisions UK-wide was presumptuous nonsense.The British paper’s failure to even discuss the EU-UK regulatory alignment that would be essential to any border-control-free regime is bizarre. As is its attempt to equate an “expectation” of a time limitation to the backstop with a specific commitment to one – as Barnier pointed out a time-limited backstop is no backstop, no guarantee.EU diplomats warn that the next couple of weeks will see as tough talks as any so far. They remain adamant that no acceptable deal on a backstop will see no deal on a Withdrawal Agreement and no transition.But there is another fatal flaw at the heart of the British strategy – an assumption, endlessly repeated, that a comprehensive deal will actually remove the necessity for the backstop and the inevitable Irish Sea checking of goods, food and animals.For one thing, the negotiation of an alternative deal is not a given. It will be a hugely complex process and most unlikely to be completed by the autumn.Moreover, should the deal not be able to provide the same level of safeguards required to deliver and maintain the North’s frictionless border – most unlikely if the UK maintains its refusal to stay in the customs union and single market – there will be an insistence by the EU that the “fallback” backstop remain in place.It’s not a case of eitheror, but both.

We are also committed to maintaining the integrity of our own internal market. That position will not change. The commission’s proposals did not achieve this, which is why we have put forward our own backstop solutions for customs,” a government spokesperson said.“All parties must recall their commitment in the joint report to protect the Belfast agreement in all its parts. Michel Barnier has confirmed today that discussions will now continue on our proposal.”Mr Barnier rejected of two of the British backstop proposal’s most important elements – extending the backstop to the whole of the UK and making it time-limited. Nigel Dodds, deputy leader of the DUP, on whose 10 votes at Westminster Ms May depends for her majority, said his party could not agree to Mr Barnier’s proposals.“Michel Barnier’s latest comments demonstrate he has no respect for the principle of consent or the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. This is nothing more than an outrageous attempt to revert to the annexation of Northern Ireland. We will not accept such a proposal,” he said.Irish sources said Mr Barnier’s reaction to the British proposals was more hardline than expected, and attributed this to last minute changes made to the British paper, inserted to satisfy the hard Brexiteers in Theresa May’s cabinet.However, most sources in Dublin and Brussels said they believed that the threat of a collapse of the talks in June had receded, and that the two sides would “muddle through” the next few weeks and through the June summit, leaving most of the key issues to be settled in October.One senior figure in Dublin, however, warned of diminishing patience with Mrs May in key European capitals.There is some concern in Dublin that the question of the backstop, and the broader arrangements for the future relationship that will affect Ireland and the border, will all be settled together in the autumn, raised the prospect of Irish interests being “squeezed” as part of a wider deal.In the North, the DUP reacted with hostility to Mr Barnier’s statement. The DUP leader Arlene Foster said that the the DUP would “not tolerate the annexation of Northern Ireland” while the party’s deputy leader Nigel Dodds said that Mr Barnier “has no respect for the principle of consent or the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom”.Earlier, the prime minister expressed full confidence in foreign secretary Boris Johnson but declined to comment on leaked remarks he made at a dinner this week. In a speech to the Conservative Way Forward group, a recording of which was leaked to BuzzFeed, Mr Johnson said the issue of the Irish Border had taken on too great a significance in Britain’s negotiations with the EU.“It’s so small and there are so few firms that actually use that border regularly, it’s just beyond belief that we’re allowing the tail to wag the dog in this way. We’re allowing the whole of our agenda to be dictated by this folly,” he said.The prime minister’s official spokesperson declined to comment directly on Mr Johnson’s comments but rejected the sentiments expressed about the issue of the Border.“Northern Ireland has been a priority for the prime minister from day one, and will continue to be so,” the spokesperson said.“It is a priority not because the EU has made it one, but because the prime minister is committed to the union and the emergence of a hard border would put that at risk. I’m not going to engage on the wording, but this is our position and why it is so vital to the prime minister.”In the speech, the foreign secretary described the Treasury as “the heart of Remain” and suggested that the aggressive, unpredictable approach Donald Trump might take to Brexit talks would have been more fruitful.During a visit to Germany on Friday, chancellor of the exchequer Philip Hammond said his experience told him that a collaborative approach was generally more productive than a confrontational one.“Finding a mutually beneficial outcome is the only way forward. That is the firm intention of my government. Theresa May, the prime minister, has said so very clearly,” Mr Hammond said.Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, called on Ms May to sack her foreign secretary, saying his remarks at the dinner offered further evidence that he was not fit to occupy one of the great offices of state.“Any prime minister that had any semblance of authority would have got rid of Boris Johnson a long time ago, not just because of comments like this,” she said.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"city highlights fromnational geographic travel photographer","story":"This is a selection of images from the National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year Contest which is open for entries until May 31, 2018.The Scenic Suitcase taken by Stephanie MillerThe colorful streets of Bo Kaap weren\u0027t always this way.

My company manager then gave me a call, so I thought I was going to have to go on at the Theatre Royal.“But he told me that Mamma Mia!’s company manager was on the phone asking if I was in the building because they had an emergency. I simply got told: ‘They need you there, can you run over to Mamma Mia! and go now’.”The reaction from the 1,100-strong audience when Parry, 35, stepped on stage was euphoric, with loud applause greeting her appearance.The Novello Theatre, in London\u0026#39s West EndDuring the scramble to find a replacement for Deverill they had been told theatre management were doing their best to make sure the award winning show could continue, but few held out much hope until they managed to get hold of Parry.“There was huge applause when she came on stage,” said a spokesman for the Novello Theatre. “They were desperate to see the show so you can imagine the reaction.”Parry last played the part of Donna Sheridan on stage in 2013 - although she did reprise the role on a cruise ship last year - so says she was a bit rusty, particularly in the dance scenes.“Suddenly had to revert right back, so I was being pulled around stage and guided along by others as we went through the night,” said Parry.“It was a packed house and they were marvellous. I honestly wish I could have taped the reaction and had it on demand for whenever I’m feeling down. I think it’s a really good moment to celebrate the camaraderie of the West End, that 42nd Street wanted me to go and help out another show and that we could pull all that together for the audience.”Mr Effeney said the chances of Parry being able to step in had been “one in a billion”, telling the Evening Standard: “Otherwise we would have had to abandon the show and refund everybody’s money.”He added: “It was a completely unique experience for the audience. When something like that happens and it works the audience love it.”Queen\u0026#39s Birthday Honours List: Keira Knightley and Mary Beard among increasing number of women recognisedComment: Ten incredible facts about David Davis: the James Bond of BrexitComment: Why seedy misogyny did not die with Peter Stringfellow – and it might be even worseG7 summit to end in acrimony after Trump clashes with EU leaders over trade, Russia and environmentChinese hackers \u0026#39steal secret US Navy plans for supersonic submarine missiles\u0026#39G7 leaders scramble to find common ground after Donald Trump throws summit into chaosMaria Bueno, three-time Wimbledon champion whose pink knickers caused a storm, dies from cancerEmmanuel Macron leaves his mark on Donald Trump with white-knuckle handshake at G7American soldier killed in Somalia as troops come under mortar fireBogus cosmetic surgeon becomes first to be convicted of injecting fake Botox on two women Council asks ‘who is in charge’ in the wake of Grenfell disasterRobert Mueller moves closer to Kremlin as he charges Paul Manafort and Russian associate with obstruction Prescribe line dancing to save the NHS, officials saySikh Guardsman hopes Trooping the Colour will be \u0026#39change in history\u0026#39The reluctant world leader: Disgruntled Trump shares stage with global \u0026#39allies\u0026#39    Arise Sir Kenny: Liverpool and Scotland legend Kenny Dalglish receives a knighthoodThe Queen opens new exhibition at Westminster AbbeyThe general election: one year onSupermarket scandal: Pork and turkey found in vegan and \u0026#39meat free\u0026#39 mealsComment: A third runway would generate billions for the economy.

Knightley receives an OBE.The proportion of women receiving the highest level of awards in the Queen’s Birthday Honours List has risen to 41 per cent this year, compared to 39 per cent in the most recent New Year’s Honours List.But the improvement is particularly pronounced when compared to 2015 when just seven Dames were created in the Birthday Honours, compared to 33 knighthoods.This year there are 11 Dames and 21 Knights and the number of women receiving the higher awards of CBE and above has risen by ten per cent in the past three years.The shift is part of a deliberate move to reflect the increasingly prominent role of women in public life and comes on the 100th anniversary of the first women being given the vote.Mary Beard, Professor of Classics at the University of CambridgeProf Beard - who has described her on-screen appearance as “slightly creaky old lady with long grey hair” - has long used her role as a broadcaster to challenge the way women in the public eye are expected to be portrayed and has frequently been subjected to vicious comment on social media as a result.She was also once described by the late TV critic AA Gill as “too ugly for television, but she responded in characteristic style, accusing him of being part of the blokeish culture that loves to decry clever women.But she drew criticism from fellow feminists after suggesting it would be hard to sustain ‘civilised’ values in a disaster zone” such as Haiti, following revelations that Oxfam aid workers there had allegedly taken part in the sexual abuse of women and children.Dame Mary said: It is of course a smashing honour. I feel especially pleased that someone working on the ancient classical world gets honoured in this way.I\u0027d like to treat it as a bit of a tribute to the Greeks and Romans themselves - as well as to all my wonderful academic colleagues.She added: I have lived through a gender revolution in my lifetime...but there is still a hell of a long way to go.Knightley receives an OBE for her services to drama and charity some 16 years after bursting onto the scene playing a football mad teenager in Bend It Like Beckham.She was nominated for an Oscar in 2006, as best actress for Pride \u0026amp Prejudice, and again for best supporting actress for The Imitation Game in 2015 and has gone on to work with several charities and campaign groups, including Amnesty International, Unicef and Comic Relief.Also receiving a Damehood is the actress Emma Thompson, while Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, the soprano, becomes a Companion of Honour.Emma Thompson, seen here as Goneril in the BBC\u0026#39s King Lear, has been made a DameOther women recognised in the list include the lawyer and businesswoman Margaret Casely-Hayford, who is made a CBE for her work in pushing for greater number of women to be represented in company boardrooms.Dr Frances Carolyn Saunders becomes a Dame after working to encourage more women and young people from all backgrounds to go into science, technology and engineering.Another pioneering woman recognised in this year’s Birthday Honours is Kathleen Moore, who became a carpenter after leaving school - only to find herself “the only woman on site” - and went on to set up Women Into Construction (WIC), to encourage and train women to go into what has traditionally been a male industry.Ms Moore, who is made a MBE, said of her own experience: “The women in the class would be really enthused, but at the end of the course it would the guys that got the jobs. I thought it was time we did something about this.”Overall just under half (49 per cent) of the 1,057 iniduals recognised in this year’s Birthday Honours are women.A Cabinet Office source said: “In the 100th anniversary year of women’s suffrage, there is a range of awards for women at the forefront of their professions who have championed women’s rights.”Rosemary Powell receives an MBE for her services to charity, having sold poppies for most of her lifeA pensioner who has devoted her life to selling poppies for wounded veterans has become the oldest woman in living memory to receive an honour.Rosemary Powell becomes a MBE at the age of 103, in recognition of her charitable services, having spent an incredible 97 years volunteering for the Royal British Legion.She began helping her mother Evelyn sell poppies on Richmond Bridge, in south west London, for the Legion\u0027s first Poppy Appeal in 1921, when she was  just six.From 1975 to the mid-1990s, Mrs Powell lived in France with her husband Selwyn, a Royal Navy officer, and sold blue cornflowers, the French equivalent to British poppies.She even continued selling poppies after moving into a nursing home three years ago.News of the award comes a few days after Mrs Powell, who lost two godfathers and three uncles during the First World War decided to retire from her fundraising activities.“Collecting has kept me going all these years, she said. “It has always been a very important cause for me, she said.  We did it in memory of those men who were killed, for their sacrifice.Mrs Powell’s first fiance, Robin Ellis, a commander in the Royal Navy, died in 1944 when the Lancaster bomber he was flying in crashed near Inverness, and her younger brother Peter, a major in the Army, died during the Second World War.Her son Giles said: The MBE is a tremendous reward for years and years of hard work and loyalty.Mum is absolutely over the moon. It\u0027s great recognition for a lot of hard work.Her other son Nick added: There is no doubt that she was inspired by the terrible loss her mother suffered, as well as her own personal loss of her fiance, Robin Ellis.Akeela Ahmed, who has been awarded an MBE in the Queen\u0026#39s Birthday Honours list, at Lancaster House, LondonA community activist who campaigns for more Muslim women to take part in public life has said that honouring migrants helps give them an equal stake in British society.Akeela Ahmed, who receives a MBE for her work in encouraging Muslim women to vote, said her recognition in the Queen’s Birthday Honours sent a powerful signal about social cohesion and inclusivity.Mrs Ahmed said: “For me, as a second generation migrant, to receive an honour is so important for migrants generally to be able to say we are here and we are as much a part of this country as anyone else and we are as proud as anyone else to be recognised.”“My real hope is that they realise it doesn\u0027t matter if you’re a woman of colour, you can have your achievement recognised and valued.”This year ten percent of honours recipients come from a black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) background, roughly the same as last year.Mrs Ahmed, 39, founded an online forum called She Speaks, We Hear four years ago to encourage Muslim women to speak out about issues which matter to them after she became increasingly disenchanted with the way they were being portrayed in the media.She made it her mission to urge women from the Muslim women to exercise their franchise, in the face of assertions from extremist groups that voting is against Islam.“It’s really important that women from different communities feel they can take part in all areas of society,” she said. “So often their stories and voices go unheard.”Mrs Ahmed said she was so shocked at receiving the letter informing her of the award that she had to ask her husband to read it, just to make sure.Comment: Ten incredible facts about David Davis: the James Bond of BrexitComment: Why seedy misogyny did not die with Peter Stringfellow – and it might be even worseG7 summit to end in acrimony after Trump clashes with EU leaders over trade, Russia and environmentChinese hackers \u0026#39steal secret US Navy plans for supersonic submarine missiles\u0026#39G7 leaders scramble to find common ground after Donald Trump throws summit into chaosMaria Bueno, three-time Wimbledon champion whose pink knickers caused a storm, dies from cancerEmmanuel Macron leaves his mark on Donald Trump with white-knuckle handshake at G7American soldier killed in Somalia as troops come under mortar fireBogus cosmetic surgeon becomes first to be convicted of injecting fake Botox on two women Council asks ‘who is in charge’ in the wake of Grenfell disasterRobert Mueller moves closer to Kremlin as he charges Paul Manafort and Russian associate with obstruction Prescribe line dancing to save the NHS, officials saySikh Guardsman hopes Trooping the Colour will be \u0026#39change in history\u0026#39The reluctant world leader: Disgruntled Trump shares stage with global \u0026#39allies\u0026#39    Arise Sir Kenny: Liverpool and Scotland legend Kenny Dalglish receives a knighthoodThe Queen opens new exhibition at Westminster AbbeyThe general election: one year onSupermarket scandal: Pork and turkey found in vegan and \u0026#39meat free\u0026#39 mealsComment: A third runway would generate billions for the economy.

Over time these patches usually become bigger causing blurry, misty vision and eventually blindness, if left untreated.Cataracts are more common in the elderly and can affect the ability to carry out daily activities such as driving.The Queen at Epsom Downs Racecourse on June 1A family history of cataracts can increase the risk of developing them.The Queen Mother had an operation to remove a cataract from her left eye in 1995 when she was 95 but, unlike her daughter, she spent a night in King Edward VII\u0027s Hospital after the surgery.Video: The Queen attends Chelsea Flower Show on May 21The Queen, who is in good health, is known for her robust constitution. In 2013, she had her first hospital stay in 10 years when, at the age of 86, she suffered symptoms of gastroenteritis and missed an engagement in Swansea.A week of engagements, including a two-day trip to Rome, was cancelled and the Queen spent one night in hospital. She usually attends hospital for an annual routine check-up.Cataracts occur when changes in the lens of the eye cause it to become less transparent, which results in cloudy or misty vision.This can prevent someone from driving, undertaking work that requires fine detail and recognising faces.Surgery to remove and replace the affected lens with an artificial one is the most common surgical procedure carried out on the NHS.Around 390,000 cataract surgeries take place each year in England and 16,000 in Wales, according to the eye research charity Fight for Sight.The condition most commonly affect adults as a result of ageing. Most people start to develop cataracts after the age of 65, but some people in their forties and fifties can also develop them.Surgery to remove a patient\u0026#39s cataracts.

But the surgery is a straightforward procedure that usually takes 30 to 45 minutes.It is often carried out as day surgery under local anaesthetic, meaning the patient can go home the same day.During the operation, the surgeon makes a tiny cut in the eye to remove the cloudy lens and replaces it with a clear plastic one.On the NHS, patients are offered monofocal lenses, which have a single point of focus - either near or distance vision.Those going private, like the Queen, can choose either a multifocal or an accommodating lens, which allows the eye to focus on both near and distant objects.The Queen wears sunglasses at Epsom Downs on June 1 - just days after her cataracts procudureMost people will need to wear glasses for some tasks, like reading, after surgery regardless of the type of lens they have fitted.It can take four to six weeks to fully recover from cataract surgery. If cataracts affect both eyes, two separate operations are required, usually carried out six to 12 weeks apart.The risk of serious complications developing as a result of cataract surgery is very low.Worldwide, cataracts are the leading cause of blindness, according to The International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness, for which the Queen\u0027s daughter-in-law the Countess of Wessex is a global ambassador.Some 65 million people across the globe have been left blind or with moderate to severe visual impairment due to the condition.The Queen is known for her robust health. Her son the Duke of York once described her as being incredibly fit for her age, and the 92-year-old monarch still rides her Fell ponies at Windsor, and drives, mainly around her private estates.She has called time on her overseas travels, leaving long-haul destinations to the younger members of her family. But she still has a busy diary of events, and in 2017 carried out 296 engagements.In November 2017, the Prince of Wales led the nation in honouring the country\u0027s war dead on Remembrance Sunday at the Cenotaph.It was the first time that the Queen, as head of state, had watched the ceremony from a nearby balcony, and was seen as a sign of the royal family in transition and an acknowledgement of her age.Just before Christmas 2016, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh both fell ill with heavy colds, forcing them to delay their trip to Sandringham by a day.The Queen watched the 2017 Remembrance Sunday service from a balconyThe Queen was not well enough to attend the Christmas Day service at St Mary Magdalene church and also missed the New Year\u0027s Day one. She later described it as a particularly grisly mixture of cold and flu.She turned 90 in 2016 and, the same year, used the lift rather than stairs to enter Parliament for the State Opening, avoiding the 26 steps of the royal staircase at the Sovereign\u0027s Entrance.Buckingham Palace said the modest adjustment to arrangements were made for the Queen\u0027s comfort. The decision was attributed to the Queen suffering from knee pain.In 2014, the Prince of Wales stood in for the Queen for part of the Order of the Bath service to avoid her having to make an extra journey up and down some steep steps in full regalia.In November 2013, the Duke of Cambridge stepped in to represent the Queen at an investiture ceremony after she suffered some mild discomfort with her ankle after a busy weekend of engagements including the service of remembrance at the Cenotaph.Video: The Queen\u0027s life on screenHer first hospital stay in 10 years came in 2013 when she was 86 after she suffered symptoms of gastroenteritis and missed an engagement in Swansea when she was due to present St David\u0027s Day leeks to the 3rd Battalion The Royal Welsh.On March 3 2013, she was admitted to King Edward VII\u0027s Hospital to be assessed. A week of engagements, including a two-day trip to Rome, was cancelled.The Queen spent one night in hospital and left thanking staff and smiling before being driven to Buckingham Palace to rest.It was thought her public appearances were back on track until Buckingham Palace announced on the morning of the Commonwealth Day Observance service on March 11 that she regrettably could no longer attend as she continues to recover following her recent illness.It was the first Commonwealth Day Observance service she had missed in 20 years, the last occasion being when she had flu in 1993.The Queen leaves the King Edward VII hospital in March 2013 following a short stayThe Queen, who placed great importance to her role as Head of the Commonwealth, did however attend the Commonwealth Reception at Marlborough House on the evening of March 11 to sign the new Commonwealth Charter.Buckingham Palace insisted it was just the tail end of the symptoms and that her condition had not worsened.But the next day she cancelled her engagements for the rest of the week, with her son, the Duke of York, saying later that it was sensible not to risk her coming out, but that she was not ill.Her illnesses have been few and far between over the years. She has suffered from back pain, and also had operations to remove torn cartilage from both knees.She caught measles when Prince Charles was two months old in 1949 and had to be separated from her baby son.Queen Elizabeth II: Our monarch in picturesThe first time the Queen was actually admitted to hospital was in July 1982 when she had a wisdom tooth extracted at the King Edward VII Hospital in central London.The Queen\u0027s no-fuss approach to injury and illness was perfectly illustrated in 1994. She broke her left wrist when her horse tripped during a ride on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk.The break was not diagnosed until almost 24 hours later when her arm was X-rayed and set in plaster at a hospital.It was the first time she had fallen in many years and the Queen had simply brushed herself down, remounted her horse and trotted on back to Sandringham.Please review our commenting policyComment: Ten incredible facts about David Davis: the James Bond of BrexitComment: Why seedy misogyny did not die with Peter Stringfellow – and it might be even worseG7 summit to end in acrimony after Trump clashes with EU leaders over trade, Russia and environmentChinese hackers \u0026#39steal secret US Navy plans for supersonic submarine missiles\u0026#39G7 leaders scramble to find common ground after Donald Trump throws summit into chaosMaria Bueno, three-time Wimbledon champion whose pink knickers caused a storm, dies from cancerEmmanuel Macron leaves his mark on Donald Trump with white-knuckle handshake at G7American soldier killed in Somalia as troops come under mortar fireBogus cosmetic surgeon becomes first to be convicted of injecting fake Botox on two women Council asks ‘who is in charge’ in the wake of Grenfell disasterRobert Mueller moves closer to Kremlin as he charges Paul Manafort and Russian associate with obstruction Prescribe line dancing to save the NHS, officials saySikh Guardsman hopes Trooping the Colour will be \u0026#39change in history\u0026#39The reluctant world leader: Disgruntled Trump shares stage with global \u0026#39allies\u0026#39    Queen\u0026#39s Birthday Honours List: Keira Knightley and Mary Beard among increasing number of women recognisedArise Sir Kenny: Liverpool and Scotland legend Kenny Dalglish receives a knighthoodThe Queen opens new exhibition at Westminster AbbeyThe general election: one year onSupermarket scandal: Pork and turkey found in vegan and \u0026#39meat free\u0026#39 mealsComment: A third runway would generate billions for the economy.

After further study of the field at New York’s Bellevue Hospital, she returned to Columbia as director of its new anaesthesia ision, its first female head of department.Building the unit from the ground up in partnership with her old mentor Dr Allen Whipple\u0026nbsp(who had steered her away from surgery), Dr Apgar\u0026nbspworked tireless as both a practising physician and administrator, no easy task when America’s entry into the Second World War in 1941 created significant staffing shortages.Dr Apgar\u0026nbspdeveloped her five-point score for assessing\u0026nbspnewborn health\u0026nbspin 1952. The test grades babies on scores of zero to two on five key criteria: the colour of their skin, their pulse rate, their reflex ability, their responsiveness to limb flexion and their respiratory rate. The resulting scores are totted up to give a total out of 10 indicating the health or otherwise of the infant in question.The criteria can be remembered by the acronym\u0026nbsp”Apgar”, standing for Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration.In 1959, by which point her test had been rolled out across US maternity\u0026nbsphospitals, Dr Apgar\u0026nbspleft the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center to\u0026nbspearn\u0026nbspa Master of Public Health degree from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health and served as vice president for medical affairs at the March of Dimes Foundation to advance the study of birth defects.She was an outspoken advocate for universal vaccinations\u0026nbspto prevent mother-to-child transmission of rubella during the pandemic that struck 12.5m people in the US between 1964-65 and contributed more than 60 articles to newspapers, magazines and academic journals, publishing her book Is My Baby All Right? with Joan Beck\u0026nbspin 1973.Dr Apgar\u0026nbspwas known throughout her career for her warm bedside manner and forthright optimism. In her personal life, she played the violin, enjoyed a range of hobbies from fly-fishing and stamp collecting\u0026nbspand took flying lessons, dreaming of swooping under the George Washington Bridge.Although\u0026nbspshe rarely campaigned against or spoke publicly about gender inequalities, Dr Virginia Apgar\u0026nbspglided past\u0026nbspthe sexism of her period with ease, preferring instead to lead by example and allow her professional excellence and commitment to her work speak for itself.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

New research suggests a vital link between our ability to sense our physical bodies and knowing how we feelStephen has been married twice. Two wedding days. Two “I do”s. Yet Stephen has no happy memories from either – or, in fact, from the marriages or any of his relationships.\u0026nbspHe met his first wife on a pre-nursing course when he was just 16. Six years later, they were married. Three years after that, they got orced she was never really the right one for him, he says.Almost two decades on, in 2009, he met his second wife through a dating site. He threw himself into the relationship and, the following year, with his father and her two adult siblings present, they married at the registrar’s office in Sheffield, where they both live.\u0026nbspHe put on smiles for the wedding photos because he recognised that they were expected but, as he explains: “From an inner feeling point of view, anything I do that requires an emotional response feels like a fake.“Most of my responses are learned responses. In an environment where everyone is being jolly and happy, it feels like I’m lying. Acting. Which I am. So it is a lie.”\u0026nbspHappiness isn’t the only emotion that Stephen struggles with. Excitement, shame, disgust, anticipation, even love… he doesn’t feel these, either. “I feel something but I’m unable to distinguish in any real way what that feeling is.” The only emotions he is familiar with are fear and anger.\u0026nbspSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autism, which Stephen does not have, or with psychopathy, which he doesn’t have, either.Last year, at the age of 51, he finally learned what he does have: a little-known condition called alexithymia, a word made from Greek parts meaning, roughly, “no words for emotion”.Despite the name, the real problem for people with alexithymia isn’t so much that they have no words for their emotions, but that they lack the emotions themselves. Still, not everyone with the condition has the same experiences. Some have gaps and distortions in the typical emotional repertoire.Some realise they’re feeling an emotion, but don’t know which, while others confuse signs of certain emotions for something else – perhaps interpreting butterflies in the stomach as hunger pangs.\u0026nbspSurprisingly, given how generally unrecognised it is, studies show that about one in 10 people fall on the alexithymia spectrum. New research is now revealing what’s going wrong – and this work holds the promise not only of novel treatments for disorders of emotion, but of revealing just how the rest of us feel anything at all.\u0026nbspAfter working as a nurse for 10 years, Stephen decided he wanted to do something different. A two-year Access to University course led to a degree in astronomy and physics, and then to a job testing computer games.He built a successful career for himself, working for various companies in their computer testing departments, managing teams, and travelling around the world to speak at conferences. He had no problem conveying facts to colleagues.It was in the context of more personal relationships – or any other scenario that would typically involve expressions of emotion – that he felt things were “wrong”.\u0026nbsp“At the beginning of a relationship, I’m totally into who that person is,” he explains. “I’ve been told I’m very good at maintaining a honeymoon period for ‘longer than expected’. But after a year it takes a massive turn. It all falls apart. I’ve put myself on a pedestal to be this person which I’m really not. I react mostly cognitively, rather than it being emotions making me react. Obviously, that is not valid. It’s not real. It seems fake. Because it is fake. And you can only pretend for so long.”\u0026nbspHe and his current wife stopped living together in 2012. He saw a GP and was prescribed antidepressants. Though he was still in contact with his wife, it was clear that the relationship was no longer working. In June 2015, he attempted suicide.“I had actually been posting on Facebook and Twitter regarding killing myself and someone – I’ve never found out who – contacted the police. I was taken to hospital and treated.”\u0026nbspA psychiatrist referred Stephen for a series of counselling sessions and then a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy, a type of Freudian-based therapy that, in trying to uncover unconscious drivers of thoughts and behaviour, is similar to psychoanalysis.\u0026nbspIt was in a book called Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt, which his therapist recommended, that he first came across the concept of alexithymia.“I brought it up in therapy, and that’s when we started talking about how I was very alexithymic. Obviously, I’ve got a vocabulary. I’ve got words for emotions. But whether they’re the right words for the right emotion is a different point altogether… I just thought that I wasn’t good at talking about how I feel and emotions and stuff like that. But after a year of therapy, it became apparent that when I talk about emotions I don’t actually know what I’m talking about.”The term “alexithymic” dates from a book published in 1972 and has its origins in Freudian psychodynamic literature.Freudian ideas are now out of favour with most academic psychologists, as Geoff Bird, a professor of psychology at the University of Oxford explains. “Not to disrespect those traditions, but in the cognitive, neuro, experimental field, not so many people are really very interested in anything associated with Freud any more.”But when Bird read about alexithymia, he found the descriptions intriguing. “Actually, it’s really quite amazing.” For most people, “at a low level of emotion, you might be a bit unsure about exactly what you’re feeling, but if you have a strong emotion, you know what it is”. And yet somehow, here were people who simply did not know.\u0026nbspBird started his academic career studying autism spectrum disorder, empathy and emotional awareness, which led to his interest in alexithymia.In one of his first studies in this field, he linked alexithymia, as measured with a 20-item checklist developed at the University of Toronto, with a lack of empathy. If you can’t feel your own emotions in the typical way, it makes sense that you can’t identify with those of others, either.\u0026nbspBut what really drew Bird into alexithymia research were his interactions with people with autism. “There has been this perception that people with autism don’t have empathy. And that’s rubbish. And you can see that immediately as soon as you meet some autistic people.”In a series of studies, Bird has found that about half of people with autism have alexithymia – it’s these people who struggle with emotion and empathy, while the rest do not. In other words, emotion-related difficulties are intrinsic to the alexithymia, not to the autism.Bird is passionate about spreading this message. He talks with feeling about one particular autistic study volunteer who did not have alexithymia: “A lovely guy with an IQ we couldn’t measure, it’s that good. He couldn’t hold down a job. But he volunteered to work at a care home because he wanted to do something productive with his time.“They said, ‘Oh because you’ve got a diagnosis of autism you can’t do empathy, therefore you can’t look after our elderly people.’ Which is just ridiculous.”\u0026nbspBird has since run a series of studies exploring alexithymia outside the context of autism. He has found, for example, that people with the condition have no trouble recognising faces, or distinguishing pictures of people smiling and frowning.“But for a few of our really alexithymic people, while they can tell a smile and a frown apart, they have no idea what they are. That is really quite strange.”\u0026nbspMany of the people with the condition who Bird has met talk about being told by other people that they’re different, though some do recognise it in themselves early on.“I guess it’s a bit like not being able to see colour, and everybody’s always banging on about how red this is or how blue, and you come to realise there’s an aspect of human experience that you’re just not participating in.”As well as better characterising alexithymia, Bird and his colleagues have also dug into what explains it, taking what could seem to be a circular argument – Stephen has problems with emotion because he has alexithymia, which is characterised by problems with emotion – and blowing it right apart.In situations that Stephen recognises as being in theory highly emotional – like telling someone “I love you” – he experiences changes inside his body. “I feel my heart race and this rush of adrenaline, but to me that feeling is always scary. I don’t know how to react. It makes me want to either run away or react verbally aggressively.”\u0026nbspFear and anger – and confusion – he understands. “Everything else just feels all the same… it’s this feeling of, ‘Errrr, I’m not quite comfortable with this – it’s not quite right’.”\u0026nbsp“Similarly with anxiety, it might be that someone experiences an emotional response associated with a fast heartbeat – which might be excitement – but they don’t know how to interpret that, and they could panic about what’s happening in their body.”\u0026nbspThe ability to detect changes inside the body – everything from a racing heart to a ersion of blood flow, from a full bladder to a distension of the lungs – is known as interoception. It’s your perception of your own internal state.\u0026nbspDifferent emotions are associated with different physical changes. In anger, for example, the heart rate rises, blood rushes to the face, and fists clench. In fear, the heart rate also rises but blood drains from the face.It’s generally thought that these changes are not entirely specific to inidual emotions, and so context is also important: if you feel your heart racing and you’re looking at a spider, you know it’s fear that you’re feeling, not sexual arousal.\u0026nbspWhat Bird, Brewer and others have found in people with alexithymia is a reduced ability, sometimes a complete inability, to produce, detect or interpret these internal bodily changes. People with the condition have normal-range IQs.They can understand as well as anyone else that they’re seeing a spider, rather than an attractive potential partner. But either their brains aren’t triggering the physical changes that it seems are needed for the experience of an emotion, or other regions of their brains aren’t reading these signals properly.\u0026nbspIn 2016, Bird and Brewer, along with Richard Cook at City University in London, published a research paper that characterised alexithymia as a “generalised deficit of interoception”.Here, then, was an explanation for these people’s problems with emotion – but also, in effect, a manifesto stating that the perception of a range of bodily signals is important for the experience of emotion in the rest of us.\u0026nbspIt’s an idea that we already express in everyday language: in English, for an apology to mean anything, it has to be “heartfelt”. If you truly love someone, it’s with “all your heart”.When you’re really angry, your “blood boils”. Instead of saying that you’re anxious, you might talk about having “butterflies in your stomach” (thought to be caused by a ersion of blood flow away from the digestive system).While most people may not be familiar with alexithymia, there is a different disorder involving flat emotions and poor empathy that seems to fascinate us, even more than it repels us: psychopathy. Can we learn more about how we feel by understanding psychopaths?Lieke Nentjes is in her early thirties. She’s slender and softly spoken it’s hard to picture her spending countless hours in small rooms with incarcerated, unshackled psychopaths, including serially violent men who have committed murder.\u0026nbsp“Then he explained that he was at the end of his therapy and was ‘resocialising’ and no one would hire him because they were intimidated by him. He wasn’t really angry. He was frustrated.”While the nature of psychopathy is still debated, psychologists generally agree that it entails, among other things, a lack of empathy or guilt, shallow emotions, and antisocial behaviour – treating other people badly and, in some cases, engaging in criminal acts.\u0026nbspIt has certainly been suggested that the reason some psychopaths are able to torture or murder people is that they don’t process emotions properly – they don’t feel fear, for example, and they don’t recognise it in others.\u0026nbspNentjes is based at the University of Amsterdam. Here in the Netherlands, if a criminal is found to have a psychological condition that relates to the crime, he or she is deemed to be only partially responsible.Such criminals might spend a few years in a regular jail before being sent to a secure treatment centre, or they may be sent straight for treatment.\u0026nbspNentjes decided to assess a range of criminals from these centres and from jails to find out just how psychopathic they were (with particular attention to different aspects of psychopathy), to learn about their lives – their upbringing, and their criminal behaviour – and also to measure their interoceptive ability.\u0026nbsp“Emotion is very central when you look at psychopathy – or rather, lack of emotion,” she says. So could it be that psychopathic offenders just aren’t very in touch with their bodies?\u0026nbspIn the course of the interviews, Nentjes asked questions to probe their levels of empathy, and how much remorse they felt about what they had done to their victims. “Some were just completely honest, and would say, ‘I don’t care,’” she says.“Others who were psychopathic would say, ‘Oh, but I’m very empathic.’ They had learned the lingo to describe feelings very accurately and they could talk about compassionate, empathic feelings towards others – but then when you look at the crimes they have committed…” Her sentence trails off.\u0026nbsp“There is research finding that psychopathic offenders can describe emotions in terms of words, but they lack the inner experience of the emotion,” she adds.\u0026nbspSince assessing a person’s ability to detect a range of bodily signals is tricky, the most commonly used measures of interoceptive sensitivity are based on judgements of heart rate. One test involves asking participants to count their heartbeats over varying periods – 25 or 50 seconds, perhaps – multiple times.About 10 per cent of us are good at counting heartbeats, 5 to 10 per cent are very bad, and the rest fall somewhere in between.In another test, volunteers are played a series of beeps that are either in sync or out of sync with their heartbeat, and asked which it is. On this type of task, about 10 per cent of the general population can do it really well, and 80 per cent can’t do it at all.\u0026nbspNentjes brought the necessary equipment for the heartbeat synch task with her into the interview rooms, and took measures for 75 offenders. She found a clear link: the higher an offender’s score on the antisocial aspect of psychopathy, the poorer their performance on the heart-rate task.This does at least suggest that psychopaths who are poorer at detecting bodily signals feel less emotion and therefore less empathy for others.Psychopathic criminals are sometimes ided into the “white-collar” type, who tend to commit non-violent crimes such as fraud, and the violent type. In her interviews with this violent group, Nentjes was struck by one similarity, in particular, compared with the white-collar group.“That was their upbringing. Or rather lack of it. Emotional abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. A lot of physical abuse. I’ve heard people literally say that emotion is not of use to them. All they felt during their upbringing was fear.”\u0026nbspAs a child, Stephen suffered extreme emotional neglect. When he was six, his mother intentionally set fire to their home in Nottingham while she, Stephen, his younger brother and even younger sister were all inside. Fortunately, the children’s father, who had left for work, realised that he’d forgotten his packed lunch and came home.\u0026nbspLooking back, Stephen says it’s clear that his mother was suffering from post-natal depression. But she received no treatment, “and all I knew was anxiety and being worried”. After the fire, his mother went to prison. His father was a steelworker, who worked all kinds of shifts.“A neighbour contacted social services and Dad was told to sort it out or they’d take us away. None of my dad’s brothers or sisters wanted me or my brother because we were little shits. We were always in trouble. Robbing shops. All kinds of stuff. So we went into care.”\u0026nbspFor the rest of his childhood, Stephen was in and out of care homes. The only emotions he remembers feeling, even then, are fear, anger and confusion. “Christmas, birthdays, people out of the blue at care homes being nice to me… I never really got used to it. I always felt uncomfortable. There’s just a mess of feelings inside me that I don’t interpret properly, or respond to properly.”\u0026nbspAlexithymia is often associated with trauma and neglect from a young age, explains Geoff Bird. Twin studies have suggested a genetic component, too. And it’s also linked to certain types of brain damage, particularly to the insula, the region that receives interoceptive signals.\u0026nbspAs Rebecca Brewer notes, the kind of anxiety that Stephen experiences is common in people with poor interoception. At the University of Sussex, Hugo Critchley and Sarah Garfinkel, who have expertise in psychiatry and neuroscience, are looking at ways to alter interoception, to bring anxiety down.\u0026nbspGarfinkel has put forward a three-dimensional model of interoception that has been well received by others in the field. First, objective accuracy at perceiving interoceptive signals – how good you are at counting heartbeats, for example.Second, subjective report – how good you think you are. And third, metacognitive accuracy – how good you are at knowing how good you actually are.\u0026nbspThe third dimension is important because various studies have found that the gap between how good someone thinks they are at counting heartbeats, for example, and how good they actually are predicts their levels of anxiety.Lisa Quadt, a research fellow with the Sussex group, is now running a clinical trial with the aim of testing whether reducing this gap for people with autism can reduce their anxiety.In a pilot study, Critchley, Garfinkel and MSc student Abigail McLanachan recruited a group of students who came into the lab for six training sessions. In each session, they first did the heartbeat-counting task.The volunteer sat at rest, with a loose rubber pulse oximeter on their forefingers, and reported how many beats they’d counted. Then McLanachan told them how they’d done so that they got a better sense of how accurate they were.McLanachan then got them to do a few minutes of jumping jacks or walking fast up the steep hill outside the building – whatever was necessary to raise their heart rate, to make it easier to detect. (“Because some people really can’t feel their heartbeat at all. I can’t,” Quadt explains.)Then they went back into the lab, did the tasks again and, as before, were given feedback each time.\u0026nbspThis was just a pilot study on a general student population. But after three weeks, not only had the students’ accuracy improved on all three dimensions of interoception, but they also reported reductions in anxiety of around 10 per cent.\u0026nbspFor the main trial, volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will complete the same tasks as in the pilot, but once at the start and once at the end they’ll do them inside an MRI scanner.This will allow the team to monitor activity in the insula, which receives heart-rate data, and look at how changes in that activity may correspond to connections between the amygdala, which detects threats, and the prefrontal cortex, which can work out whether a potential threat really is or is not dangerous and so whether anxiety is warranted.The hope, Critchley explains, is to see improved connectivity between these two regions, which previous studies have linked to reduced anxiety.\u0026nbspIn Oxford, meanwhile, Geoff Bird wants to look at the idea that there are two different types of alexithymia. People with one type don’t produce enough of the bodily signals necessary for the experience of an emotion, so would be unlikely to benefit from the Sussex group’s kind of training.People with the other type produce all kinds of bodily sensations but their brains don’t process these signals in the typical way. This second group, which includes Stephen, might benefit more.\u0026nbspBird stresses that, although people with alexithymia struggle to understand emotion, that doesn’t mean they don’t care about other people. “For the most part, iniduals with alexithymia can recognise that others are in a negative state, and this makes them distressed.“The problem is that they can’t work out what the other person is feeling, and what they are feeling, and therefore how to make the other person feel better or how to reduce their own distress. I think that’s important because alexithymia is different from psychopathy in that respect.”Stephen says that for him, this is certainly true. And in theory, an emotional training technique is something he would welcome. “I’ve got several books about emotions and feelings and they don’t make a jot of difference because they’re not talking specifically enough about what you actually feel within your body is which emotion.”\u0026nbspFor now, given the absence of available treatments for alexithymia, Stephen plans to use his newfound understanding of himself, gained through therapy, to try to move forwards. At first, he says, he hoped that therapy would fix everything.“I thought every day would be perfect, brilliant… and I’ve come to realise that’s not going to happen. I’m always going to have problems, always going to have issues.”\u0026nbspHe’s learned valuable lessons, he says. Though he and his wife are still separated, they talk regularly and now he tries not to reject her views on his anxiety. “Rather than go, ‘No,’ I will listen. I think, ‘Well, you know what emotions are about and I don’t, so I’m going to listen to you and I’ll either take it on board or I’ll find a way to deal with it’.”He’s also thinking about moving to work with people who are struggling with substance abuse, because he’d like to be back in a career where he can help people.\u0026nbspMost of all, he’s determined to use his diagnosis of alexithymia. “For me, it empowers me – now I know about it, I can read about it. I can find out more about it. And I can develop certain tools that enable me to combat it.”People without alexithymia could probably use such tools as well. Bird has led work showing that people who are more aware of their own heartbeat are better able to recognise others’ emotions, a crucial first step in being empathetic.He’s planning studies to investigate whether heartbeat training might therefore increase empathy.\u0026nbspThose who want to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in daily life, but who either can’t or don’t want to change the sources of stress, could focus on changing the signals coming from their bodies instead.Regular physical exercise should dampen down the kinds of bodily signals (from the heart and circulation, for example) that the brain could interpret as being anxious – so it should dampen down feelings of anxiety, too.\u0026nbspKnowing that signals from our bodies underpin our emotions could be empowering for all of us.

Andy Martin on the man who’ll be guiding ITV viewers through a month of World Cup hyperboleEverybody is a commentator these days. @Chasepacheco1, for example, who tweeted after last month’s Uefa Champions League final:\u0026nbsp“My Liverpool team fought hard and I’m proud of them. Except for Karius, he can die in a hole.” Loris Karius, Liverpool’s German goalkeeeper, let in three goals (one of them, to be fair, a moment of sheer brilliance by Gareth Bale). Which means that online he finds himself denounced as a “Nazi”. And, according to one theory, paid handsomely for his “howlers” by Real Madrid. We can assume that the World Cup in Russia this month will be the occasion of a deluge of similar wildly overheated rhetoric, hyperbole and death threats.But you won’t be hearing any of it from ITV’s chief football commentator Clive Tyldesley. Winner many times over of the Royal Television Society Sports Commentator of the Year award, he is the voice of moderation, the calm centre at the eye of the storm. Occasionally the target of Twitter rage himself, he expects to encounter not just a lot of verbals but also racism, hooliganism, and misogyny on top. Football, he says, is “warts and all. It reflects life. It corrupts. That is part of its fascination.” But, from the heights of the commentary box, he tries to provide something like a counterpoint to all the frenzy, the agony and the ecstasy.He is a fit-looking 63 and described himself as “a respecter of vocabulary” when I went to see him shortly before the Champions League final. “I would never say it’s a ‘disaster’ or a ‘tragedy’ if the ball goes through the goalkeeper’s legs,” he said. “You only use words like that if somebody dies.” He thought he might stretch to “calamity”.\u0026nbspHis words were strangely prophetic. As it turned out that is exactly the word he selected to describe Liverpool’s “goalkeeping calamity” when Karius bowled the ball right onto the toe of Benzema. But it struck me that there was also a kind of poetry, of a restrained, austere kind, in his summary of Real Madrid’s first goal, perhaps something like an instant haiku:And Real Madrid are in front.His “an evening that had started so promisingly for Liverpool” sounded a poignantly elegiac note. I also had to admire the comment, after Karius lets a tame one by Bale slip through his hands and into the net: “His reputation would do well to survive that moment.” Note the use of the conditional tense. Tyldesley appreciates that the keeper’s reputation is already in tatters, but that – perhaps in an ideal world – it could still recover.David Hume said that you cannot get an “ought” from an “is”. Somehow Clive Tyldesley manages to pull that off. He is only describing a game of football but there is an implicit ethics in his commentary. Tyldesley agrees with Bill Shankly that football is not a matter of life and death, but omits the punchline, “it’s more important than that.” Still, it is “a huge emotional investment by all the people who turn on. They choose to watch.” Therefore, as a commentator, “You have to be careful with your use of words.”The Playstation Schools Cup U15 final, between Thomas Telford School and Carshalton Boys Sports College, held at Reading’s Madejski stadium, was as fraught and intense as any Champions League final. Some of the players even had agents already. “Maybe overdid it a bit, Hodnett,” commented Tyldesley, in his simultaneous schools broadcast, as he skyed the ball over the bar. He prepared for this game as scrupulously as he is now preparing for the opening game of the World Cup between Russia and Saudi Arabia, and had a foolscap file in front of him containing assorted facts about the players.There was a goalmouth melee, which saw both the Carshalton goalkeeper and the Telford player red-carded. And a penalty shootout after the much fancied Telford came back from 2-0 down only to blow it on the last kick of the game. “Now that is absolutely out of order,” said Tyldesley, as the hulking No 10 wrapped a menacing paw around the referee. “He’d have done well to keep his opinions to himself.” It’s advice he has tried to follow.But in a sense all of his commentary implies an opinion. Presumably he would have disapproved of Zinedine Zidane’s farewell headbutt on Marco Materazzi in 2006 and David Beckham’s retaliation on Diego Simeone that got him sent off in 1998. Tyldesley himself doesn’t get flustered. He is unflappable. He has – and admires – grace under pressure. “His control wasn’t the best,” as he said in one of his critical remarks about the U15 final. The ability to take and keep control is all important, whether you’re on the pitch or off it.This might have something to do with having been subjected to the furious “hairdryer” treatment from Sir Alex Ferguson when still manager of Manchester United, not just once but twice. “You really can feel your hair blowing backwards.” He thought that the boot that hit David Beckham in the face in the dressing room was “probably an accident”.Whether it’s broadcasting to schools or to 10 million people on ITV, Tyldesley always feels a sense of “responsibility”. “Balance” is a key word. He points out that the dying words of Pheidippedes, the messenger who ran all the way from Marathon to Athens to report on the outcome of the battle back in 490BC, “We won!”, only caused confusion, because people were bound to ask, “Who is ‘we’?” “He wasn’t a good journalist,” says Tyldesley. “What he should have said is ‘Athens won’.” Greece 1, Persia 0.He was once commentating on an England-Scotland game with Ron Atkinson when Atkinson insisted on saying “we”. Tyldesley said to him, “You should say ‘England’ not ‘we’.” Although he accepts that there perhaps he was being “correct beyond reason”. He allows that the occasional we “might slip out” at the World Cup. “I’m English but I’m still objective. You don’t choose to support England. It would be odd to switch to supporting Chile.”Tyldesley disapproves of those who get too fancy. “A straightforward pass would have done,” is a classic line of his, which happened to be addressed to schools. So too when it comes to commentary. He argues that cricket and golf have passages of inaction which permit – or even demand – “colour”, the kind of lyrical and expansive discourse, infinitely digressive, forever associated with John Arlott and Brian Johnston in cricket or Peter Alliss in golf. Steve Bunce likewise in boxing, and I can get similarly carried away when it comes to describing surfing, perhaps because there are often long lulls between the epic and the awesome.Tyldesley is more a fan of plain speaking. He says the best ad slogan of all time is Ronseal’s “Does exactly what it says on the tin”. That’s how he thinks commentary should be. You observe, you analyse, you try not to hype it up. You keep it “succinct”. “There’s no point trying to be Wordsworth or Browning. As Barry Davis once said, “One man’s commentator is another man’s pain in the arse.”Everything is mediated and mediatised. There are no exceptions. The old Zen koan, “If a tree fell over in the forest and no one was there to witness it would you still hear it?” now has a clear answer. Yes, because it would be captured by a passing drone or on satellite TV, blazed all over Instagram, tweeted about furiously, the tree’s friends on Facebook would start a crowdfunding campaign, and it would shortly thereafter be the subject of a controversial Channel 4 documentary. Nothing happens any more without commentary. But this is and always has been especially true of football. “They think it’s all over… it is now”, Kenneth Wolstenholme’s line, is as memorable as the 1966 World Cup final itself. Whether or not the ball crossed the line is less significant now than the fact that there was so much debate about whether or not it had. And new technology is not making the debate go away, rather the opposite.I can’t play football without also hearing something like this in my head:\u0026nbsp “Martin comes on, scores with his first touch, and the crowd goes wild.” As Simon Critchley, philosopher and (currently distraught) Liverpool fan comments in his book, What We Think About When We Think About Football, “We usually know football through commentary, through largely, and hugely, inane commentary.”Tyldesley doesn’t think of it as inane. “Sometimes,” he says, “‘a game of two halves’ is exactly what it is. You can’t improve on it.” If he were to write a book about it, it would be something like the opposite of Nick Hornby’s Fever Pitch. Hornby is all about irrational fandom, ritual, intensity of feeling. Tyldesley is more of a phlegmatic “keep calm and carry on” sort of guy. “We don’t need to see that!” he exclaimed at the sight of an overflow of emotions on the sidelines with even teachers getting hot under the collar.Albert Camus said, “I learned everything I know about morality from football.” Which is to say, when it comes to the “beautiful game”, the good, the bad, and the ugly are all on display. There are undoubtedly heroes and villains in Tyldesley’s narrative. But he does it subtly. “You try not to sound too much like a Methodist preacher,” as he puts it. When it comes to making criticism of the play – you could call it a judo throw – by Sergio Ramos, the Real Madrid captain, that resulted in Mo Salah going off in agony with a dislocated shoulder, Tyldesley is judicious but still uncompromising in his remarks. There is “a coming together with Ramos that only he can fully explain”. As he goes up to collect the cup, Ramos is described as “not everyone’s idea of a model professional – maybe nobody’s”.There is even an implicit politics in his commentary. Tyldesley has no objection to big money in football. “It’s labour intensive, they’re entitled to be paid. You can’t do without inidual players.” But still “the collective should be stronger than the inidual”. And this is where we went so badly wrong in the Brexit campaign, and the adjacent media coverage, he argues. “We turned it into a personality competition. Instead of providing the relevant information, we focused on the impact it would have on the lives of politicians.”He says that “the most popular team in this country is not Manchester United or Liverpool, it’s England. It’s a great democracy.” And he has to be “inclusive”. He would never use the word “esoteric” for example, he says, because he doesn’t “want anyone to have to get up and look for a dictionary”.When I saw him, Tyldesley was prepping Arabic and Russian names. He says, “I will try to get it correct, but I will not make sounds we don’t make in the English language.” When identifying James Rodriguez of Chile in the past, he wanted to say “James”.\u0026nbspEventually he bowed to pressure from Twitter to say “Ham-es”, in the Spanish manner. “But later I learned that his father,\u0026nbspa 007 fan,\u0026nbsphad named him after James Bond.”\u0026nbspHe felt vindicated, because in Spanish-speaking countries it’s always James, never Ham-es, Bond.\u0026nbspHe is not, he reckons, “responsible for the teaching of Spanish” or Arabic or Russian.In an extremist, Dionysian world, Tyldesley is an Apollonian voice of reason. He holds the mirror up to football with minimum distortion, minimum fuss. Sound without the fury. A degree zero of poetry. Let’s hope he doesn’t have to repeat a line he first used of England versus Iceland in 2016, “This is the most abject failure that I can recall.”Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’.

But now here she is, a teenager, and we are watching Love Island together.I am a Love Island virgin, which are three words you won’t hear together very much over the next eight weeks. I have never seen it before, and am only vaguely aware of it. That isn’t to say I’m some television snob I’ve watched copious amounts of Big Brother. I do like I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!. I have caught myself laughing at Mrs Brown’s Boys. I even saw The Chase once.But somehow, Love Island has been slightly beyond the periphery of my experience. I mean, I’ve never seen The Only Way is Essex, but I feel like I have. Love Island, though… my reality TV filter must be clogged, and the past three\u0026nbspseries of it have been caught up in the webbing, never really permeating even my subconscious mind.I have a vague idea that Love Island is some combination of castaways having to undergo Bear Grylls-style survivalist trials crossed with the sort of orgy the Marquis de Sade might have dreamed about after eating a particularly pungent cheese too close to bedtime.So, here we are, settling in front of ITV2, my teenage daughter and I. My wife questions the wisdom of Alice encouraging me to watch a programme which, she informs me, will feature a parade of nubile young women in bikinis, as though I am a pensioner in a comedy sketch who might have a heart attack. But I am insistent Alice and her friends have been frantically Snapchatting all evening in excitement at the prospect of series four of Love Island. This will help me get down with the kids, I am sure of it.I ask Alice for a brief précis of what it’s all about as the titles start. She tells me that there will be more boys than girls and everyone has to couple up but the spare boy then has to steal a girl from\u0026nbspone of the others and at the end of the first round the boy without a girl is unceremoniously dumped from the show.How utterly awful, I think. And is there a point to it all? Apparently, yes £50,000 for the last couple standing. And, apparently, “Instagram promotions”, whatever that might entail. But wait monogamy is not the name of the game. Every so often there has to be a process of “recoupling”, says Alice, which sounds to me like something unpleasant from an episode of 1970s sci-fi series Logan’s Run.This, I ponder, is going to be an interminable couple of months. Surely they must do something other than pant over each other? Yes, Alice says. There are tasks and challenges. What, like they have to catch fish and find coconuts and stuff?She laughs. No, not like that at all. And as the first of the female contestants begins to arrive, I start to understand. This is not so much Bear Grylls as Bare Arse. The girls are deposited at a posh hotel inidually, via Jeep, dressed in the teeniest, tiniest of bikinis. There is Samira, who is a dancer, Hayley, who is a model, Kendall, who manages a shoe shop. They are wearing a handkerchief’s worth of fabric between them. By the time Danny Dyer’s daughter rocks up, I am secretly wishing someone would put some clothes on. I must be getting old.I lose track of who is who because I’ve had a sudden moment of dissonance. The voiceover guy has a Scottish accent that sounds awfully familiar. It is Iain Stirling, Alice informs me. “Don’t you remember? He used to be on CBBC.”Oh my God. He’s the fresh-faced young chap who used to come on with Hacker T Dog. I always had a fondness for Hacker because he was from Wigan, like me. And now his mate Iain is narrating this cesspit. I look at my daughter, and remember those years of Tracy Beaker and Dora the Explorer. Truly, the days of innocence are over.I ask Alice, cautiously, nervously, if she looks up to these girls, whose makeup has more mass than their clothing and who are talking about willies. She rolls her eyes. “It’s just entertainment, Dad.” I think there are five practically naked girls cavorting on screen now, but to be quite honest I’m eyeing up the fire pit on the sun terrace. Is it gas powered? Where does the canister go?But here comes Caroline Flack, presiding over things like some brothel keeper in a Wild West frontier town. Because that’s exactly what it feels like when the boys turn up, one by one, like cattlemen who have been on the trail too long, excitedly wringing their stetsons and being invited by Flack to inspect the lineup of girl flesh on offer and take their pick.Oh, the girls do have a tiny bit of agency they are allowed to take a step forward if the boy in front of them takes their fancy. But ultimately, the guy gets to choose, though I am told these roles reverse in the coming days.The boys are all rippling six packs and tattoos. There’s one called Niall, who seems sweetly funny, and a guy called Wes, who claims to be some kind of engineer in the nuclear industry, except he’s having trouble saying the word “nuclear”. He gives up and falls back on some double entendre, which I’m 100 per cent sure some researcher has not written for him, promising with a leery wink to “engineer the ride of someone’s life” and then, if that was a bit too subtle, says something about having a big gear stick.My wife, no doubt thinking ahead to getting up at 6.30am today, wonders just how these people get eight weeks off work to do this. And that’s never more pressing a question than when Alex turns up. He’s an A\u0026ampE doctor. How can they spare him? He’s presumably done six years of medical school so he can try to crack off with a girl on a televised Club 18-30 holiday. Doesn’t he know how hard-pressed the NHS is? Hasn’t he seen 24 Hours in A\u0026ampE?Half an hour in and I try to get into the spirit of things by betting my daughter a fiver (I know, I know, the sheer crimes of moral turpitude we have descended to) that a boy whose name sounds like\u0026nbspEeyore, but is Eyal, will pick Samira, the dancer, who seems quite switched on compared to the others. I lose the wager. I’m disappointed in Eyal. I thought he had more about him.We meet Jack, who has the most astonishingly white teeth I have ever seen in my life. Apparently he went all the way to Turkey to get them done. You could see the glow of his teeth from the International Space Station.\u0026nbspI have drifted off when someone says, in what context I know not, that it’s “too soon to spoon!” Is it too soon to switch over and watch Lucy Worsley cosplaying a suffragette, I wonder?By this point I am finding it all quite dreadful, and not because I’m old. It’s because it reminds me of what it was like to be young. If you were ever left standing tearfully at the end of musical chairs, if you ever were picked last for games, if you ever walked home alone from a disco and listened to “How Soon Is Now?” by The Smiths on repeat while staring mournfully at your Betty Blue poster, if despite your best efforts you could only ever cultivate the physique of Little Plum from The Beano, then Love Island is a hateful parade of everything you wanted to be but weren’t.I look at Alice. God, I think, please don’t ever be so shallow as these people. But she’s on Snapchat with her friends. One of them likes Jack, he of the luminous gnashers. Alice pulls a face. Who do you like best, I ask? Eyal.Back on screen, Eyal is indeed coming across as, relatively, deep. He is trying to explain to Hayley, the model, what the word “superficial” means. There’s a new guy arrived, called Adam, whose job is to break up one of the couples and get his chosen girl to be with him. It’s becoming like a standard night out, except there are no fights. Apparently giving someone who tries to steal your girl a good shoeing is verboten and gets you kicked out.A little too late, perhaps, I start to wonder if this is really appropriate for Alice. But she has already seen the latest season of 13 Reasons Why, and also informs us that she has watched a movie called Ibiza that is trailed in the ad break which seems to be very heavy on jokes revolving around male ejaculation. Where did those Dora the Explorer days go? When Adam is going round trying to steal girls I want to shout at the screen, “Swiper no swiping!” But it would just make me sad.Everyone goes to sleep, the “couples” sharing beds. They are young and full of self-esteem, and no one is in their forties\u0026nbspand worried about snoring or accidental nocturnal flatulence. As far as I can tell, nobody has sex, which is a relief. It’s probably the best night’s kip Alex the A\u0026ampE doctor has had for years.Are you embarrassed watching this with me, I ask.\u0026nbspAlice shrugs. “Not on the first episode,” she says. “I probably would be, later on.” It will, I am told, get heavy later on. I am slightly aghast. People will actually have sex? On the telly?There was one couple that didn’t last year, says Alice. One couple that didn’t do it? Only one? I’m not sure whether to feel proud of them or sorry for them.It feels like this is going to be a very long eight weeks, daily doses of people pretty much doing the same thing over and over again. A bit like Dora the Explorer. And even with the salacious promise of off-screen sex among these beautiful, vacuous people, I imagine it’s going to be less the Marquis de Sade’s 120 Days of Sodom than 56 Days of Sod All.It’s too much time to devote to these people, and I’m afraid Alice might be on her own – with her pals on Snapchat of course – for the rest of Love Island. I gave it a go and it at best bored me, at worst made me feel vaguely angry and depressed.Though I might tune in tonight, just to see who gets kicked out after last night’s cliffhanger…or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One of the three is exactly the same size as our own world, and the others are only ever so slightly bigger.Otherwise, the planets are probably inhospitable: they are very close to their star and therefore very warm. But as yet another discovery of rocket planets that seem to show they are common throughout the universe, they are another sign that it could be more hospitable than we\u0027d thought.The other system has two much larger planets. Those worlds – which like the first system, orbit a red dwarf – are known as super Earths.Red dwarfs are old and relatively small, and the two stars are much less hot than our Sun. But the newly discovered worlds are much closer, meaning that the temperature is probably too hot for life.The five planets were found by the K2 mission of Nasa\u0027s Kepler satellite. That looks for the brief dips of light that happen when a planet passes in front of its star, and allows scientists to use the details of those dips to work out what they might be like.Scientists now hope to use further observations – from the new James Webb Space Telescope – to understand more about the planets\u0027 atmospheres.

We hope this means that disability issues aren’t being downgraded.“Life can be tough for many disabled people. It can be difficult to get and stay in work, life’s still far too expensive if you are disabled, and negative attitudes can mean day-to-day activities are an unnecessary struggle.“Government must show leadership, and implement a cross-Whitehall strategy to tackle the issues that affect disabled people every day.” he added.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Levels in the capital have consistently breached legal levels for years.On top of the new measures, a major new study launched by the mayor will test how policies like the ULEZ affect children’s respiratory health by comparing children from London schools with those from neighbouring Luton whose schools are in traffic-restricted zones.All the children will have their lung health monitored over a four-year period in the study, which is being led by Queen Mary University.Environmental lawyers ClientEarth have won legal challenges against the government three times over inadequate efforts to reduce illegal levels of harmful nitrogen dioxide.Reacting to the announcement, ClientEarth CEO James Thornton said: “This is a welcome announcement from the mayor, who has shown he is prepared to take steps to protect Londoners’ health from the city’s toxic air. Political leaders across the UK should take note.”“The arrival of the world’s first and biggest ULEZ in London is cause for a celebration,” said Paul Morozzo, clean air campaigner at Greenpeace.\u0026nbspThousands of Londoners contributed to consultations to make this a reality and it will have a major impact on air quality in the city, improving the lives of millions of people.\u0026nbsp“London has moved into the fast lane when it comes to tackling harmful air pollution, and now central government and the car industry must change up a gear and show they can match Sadiq Khan’s ambition.”\u0026nbspor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK’s plan tries to get around introducing checks by keeping the whole UK aligned with those rules, and also introduces a time-limit on the backstop.\u0026nbspBut while Mr\u0026nbspBarnier\u0026nbspsaid he was continuing the study the UK proposals, he warned that applying the backstop plan to the whole UK was not an option.“Let me be very clear: our backstop cannot be extended to the whole UK. Why? Because it has been designed for the specific situation of Northern Ireland,” he said.“What does it do? On customs, Northern Ireland would form part of our customs territory. What is feasible with a territory the size of Northern Ireland is not necessarily feasible with the whole UK.\u0026nbsp“On regulatory alignment we have been pragmatic and developed the least disruptive system for citizens and businesses on both sides. Let’s go to pragmatism. Checks carried out on ferries are less disruptive than along a\u0026nbsp500km\u0026nbspland border.”He also suggested the backstop could not be time-limited or temporary, as the UK has requested,\u0026nbspwarning: “Backstop means backstop.”\u0026nbspThe chief negotiator said he would continue looking at the UK’s proposals, despite highlighting what he said were a series of problems with them. He said the plan needed to address “full regulatory alignment” rather than only customs, that it needed to respect the integrity of the single market, and that the arrangement should be “all-weather” and prevent a hard border in all circumstances.\u0026nbspAsked why he was continuing to look at the British proposal if he had raised such fatal flaws with it, he said: “Because I look at all British proposals in an objective manner.”Mr\u0026nbspBarnier\u0026nbsprepeated his familiar refrain that Britain’s negotiators appeared to want to keep the benefits of the EU without accepting the obligations of membership.\u0026nbspBut\u0026nbsphe added: “When we tell our British counterparts that these benefits are not accessible outside the system created by the European Union… some parties in the United Kingdom are responsible for the consequences of that decision.\u0026nbsp“Let me say the following: we’re not going to be intimidated by this form of blame game. The United Kingdom has decided to leave the European Union we respect that democratic decision\u0026nbspand we are implementing it.”He said there had been some progress on other issues but that sticking points included data protection, geographical indications for products, and some matters relating to state aid. Theresa May is set to attend a summit in Brussels later this month that the EU has characterised as a staging-post to a final deal, which it wants signed by October.A British government spokesperson said: “The Prime Minster has been clear that we will never accept a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. We are also committed to maintaining the integrity of our own internal market. That position will not change. The commission’s proposals did not achieve this, which is why we have put forward our own backstop solutions for customs.“All parties must recall their commitment in the Joint Report to protect the Belfast Agreement in all its parts. Michel Barnier has confirmed today that discussions will now continue on our proposal.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Just 0.85 per cent of the public say Brexit has made them less likely to support a united Ireland.Support for the cause is more popular among\u0026nbspthe younger generation than the old, with 49.4 per cent of under-45s backing a break with the UK compared to 37.7 per cent who want to stay in it.\u0026nbspThough Catholics are significantly more likely to support joining the Republic than Protestants, a minority of the latter, 8.5 per cent, say they support leaving the UK. An overall majority (50.2 per cent) in Northern Ireland’s capital, Belfast,\u0026nbspsupport a united Ireland.Northern Ireland has become the focus of Brexit talks because it is set to become the only future land border between the EU and UK. But under the Good Friday Agreement which brought an end to the Troubles, there cannot be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.\u0026nbspThough the Government and EU both say they are committed to avoiding a hard border, leaked tapes released on Thursday showed Boris Johnson, the\u0026nbspforeign secretary,\u0026nbspsaying\u0026nbspit was “just beyond belief” that the issue was being taken so seriously and that\u0026nbsp focusing on such a “small” item amounted to “allowing the tail to wag the dog”.The YouGov poll also found that 81.3 per cent of the Northern Ireland population do not believe that politicians reflect concerns of the people in the six counties well, while just 17.1 per cent did.Leo Varadkar, the\u0026nbspIrish prime minister,\u0026nbspsaid on Friday morning that a border poll would be “isive” and “a bad idea”.\u0026nbspThe taoiseach, who is visiting Northern Ireland on Friday, told the Good Morning Ulster programme: “We should be respecting the primacy of the Good Friday Agreement and, at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement, is power sharing within Northern Ireland, ever-increasing cooperation within the north and south and peace in Britain and Ireland.“While the Good Friday Agreement provides for the possibility of a border poll, and would allow that to pass by a majority of one, I don’t think the time or the conditions are right.“I think the focus should be on getting the institutions up and running again, rather than focusing on a border poll.”His comments came after former first minister Peter Robinson argued that any future border poll could not be conducted on the basis of a simple majority.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I find it particularly interesting that the Israeli tweet uses a meme with women to react to the Ayatollah\u0026nbspKhamenei’s tweet.”Israel’s Mean Girls gif had been retweeted more than 9,000 times and liked more than 27,000 times within a day of being posted.The Twitter exchange came amid growing tensions in the Middle East since Donald Trump announced the US was withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal and reimposing sanctions on Iran.\u0026nbspOn Tuesday, Benjamin\u0026nbspNetanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, sought to convince European states to abandon the deal, claiming Tehran’s threats to increase uranium enrichment capacity showed it still planned to destroy Israel.Britain, France and Germany are scrambling to\u0026nbspsave the accord, under which Iran\u0026nbsppromised to curb its nuclear programme in return for lifted sanctions.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

If he fires at us, we will destroy his forces\u0027​Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to carry out direct military strikes targeting President Bashar al-Assad’s regime unless all Iranian forces are withdrawn from Syria.\u0026nbspThe aggressive ultimatum to Damascus is a significant escalation in the confrontation in Syria between Israel and Iran.The Syrian leader was “no longer immune, his regime is no longer immune. If he fires at us, we will destroy his forces,”\u0026nbspMr Netanyahu declared during a visit to London, speaking at a question and answer session at the Policy Exchange think tank.Israel has carried out a number of air strikes on Iranian bases in Syria and has repeatedly demanded that Iran, which it considers “an existential threat”, must remove its forces and weapons from Syria.But this was the first time that it had been stated that the Assad regime would be punished for the presence of Iranian forces, which have been fighting Isis\u0026nbspand Islamist rebels.Mr Netanyahu said: “I think there is a new calculus that has to take place and Syria has to understand that Israel will not tolerate the Iranian military entrenchment in Syria against Israel.“The consequences are not merely to the Iranian forces there but to the Assad regime as well, I think it’s something that he should consider very seriously.”The Israeli prime minister blamed Assad personally for the presence of Tehran’s forces in Syria as he warned of possible Israeli intervention.“Assad has to consider this: when they waged this horrific civil war, Israel did not intervene. Now the war is nearly over, he invites Iran in to entrench itself?” \u0026nbspThe Syrian leader was accused of facilitating Tehran “to move its army a thousand miles so it can threaten Israel. They want to bring in precision guided rockets with half a ton warheads and submarines to the Mediterranean… Iran does not believe in a master race, it believes in a master faith,” and is bent on conquest, Mr Netanyahu charged.The prime minister is on a tour of Western Europe to try to drum up support for further action against Iran, after US President Donald Trump reneged on an agreement between international powers and Tehran over its nuclear programme.The other signatories to the deal – Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China – as well as the United Nations have all stressed that it was working and the Iranian government was abiding by its commitment.Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and Theresa May have told Mr Netanyahu that they are\u0026nbspdetermined not to abandon the agreement, the scrapping of which could lead to nuclear proliferation in the region and beyond, they warned.That, he boasted, had been effectively destroyed by him and Mr Trump.He warned European businesses of the punitive fines they would face under American sanctions if they continued trading with Iran.Mr Netanyahu stated that his aim on the trip, instead, was to “expose” how “Iran is devouring one nation after another” and ask Western European governments to do more “about reversing Iran’s aggression in the region and getting them out of Syria”.The French, German and British leaders have all raised their concerns with Mr Netanyahu about the recent brutal violence at the Gaza border in which dozens of Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli troops.The UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, urged the Israeli government to open an independent inquiry into the deaths and injuries suffered during the protests.Asked at the London meeting why non-lethal methods, such as water cannons and rubber bullets, were not used, or even a policy of shooting at legs, rather than shoot to kill, not pursued, Mr Netanyahu insisted: “We have tried all these methods, they don’t work. These were not non-violent protests, quite the contrary.“We are doing everything we can to both minimise casualties and, at the same time, protect Israeli lives.”Referring to Israel’s success in technological innovations, Mr Netanyahu added “given our record, we probably will figure something out, but we haven’t got there yet. The last thing we want is violence or confrontation.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The remainder were undecided.And those aged under 45 showed an even higher level of support for a united Ireland. Those aged 18-45 were 49 percent in favour of a united Ireland, 38 percent in favour of remaining in the UK and 13 percent undecided.Brexit could lead to a united Ireland with support growingThe number of Northern Irish citizens in favour of a united Ireland appears far higher than a poll released last month, which saw the same proposal receive just 21 per cent support.However May\u0026rsquos Ipsos Mori poll was conducted face-to-face while the Lucid Talk poll was conducted online and over the phone, with pollsters believing this could help better represent the \u0026ldquoshy united Ireland voters.The BBC commissioned the most recent LucidTalk poll of 1,686 people, who were interviewed between May 4 and May 10.Support was even higher in Belfast, where a majority of 50.2 per cent said they would support a united Ireland - an \u0026ldquoincredible showing given the city\u0027s history, one expert said.Northern Irish political commentator David McCann said the result in Belfast was particularly notable given it hosted the signing of the Ulster Covenant- a document signed by 500,000 people in 1912 in protest at the growing autonomy from Britain given to\u0026nbspIreland. Many signed using their own blood with the creation of the unionist militia the Ulster Volunteers following three months later.Mr McCann of current affairs website Slugger O\u0026rsquoToole tweeted: \u0026ldquoA majority of Belfast would support a UI in the city of the Ulster Covenant. Incredible showing.Support for a united Ireland has surged since the June 2016 Brexit voteMore than a quarter of respondents said they had recently changed their mind in favour of a united Ireland due to Brexit.

Heres all you need to know...The lucky recipients of the MBE, OBE and CBE are announced a few days before the end of the year and around the Queens state birthday, which was last held on June 17, 2017.They recognise the contributions and achievements of people from all walks of life, from Hollywood stars to humble volunteers.The three most well-known awards represent different ranks in the Order of the British Empire.The highest ranking of the three is a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), followed by OBE (Officer) and then the MBE (Member).There is no female equivalent to a knighthood as women are appointed to an order of chivalry.Women who are appointed to the Most Noble Order of the Garter or the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle are given the title of Lady rather than Dame - which is used instead of the male title Sir.The honours were created in 1917 by King George V during the First World War as a way of rewarding civilians and servicemen in support positions for their contribution to the war effort.Now they are used to recognise an achievement or service to the community in any area, such as the arts, charity or education.According to the Cabinet Office, an MBE is given for an outstanding achievement or service to the community.This will have had a long-term, significant impact and stand out as an example to others.An OBE is awarded for having a major local role in any activity, including people whose work has made them known nationally in their chosen area.A CBE is awarded for having a prominent but lesser role at national level, or a leading role at regional level. You can also get one for a distinguished, innovative contribution to any area.The New Years Honours themselves date back to 1890 - read our history of the awards to find out more.On June 1, 2018, TV presenter Eamonn Holmes was awarded an OBE for services to broadcasting.The British honours system actually has several orders, mostly relating to the monarchy, military and colonial officials.But King George V wanted to fill the gap by creating an order which would honour normal people.However, the order has come under some criticism due to its connection with the now extinct British Empire.The Government has considered changing the name to the Order of British Excellence, but decided not to make any changes until after the orders centenary in 2017.The CBE is the third highest of the orders five ranks but only the top two can use title Sir, for a man, or Dame, for a woman.The second highest rank is a KBE or DBE - a Knight or Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire.The top rank in the Order is a GBE - a Knight or Dame Grand Cross - but these are only given out very rarely. Since 2000, just 16 have been awarded, all to men.But, confusingly, people can still become a Sir or a Dame without receiving a KBE or a GBE as they can be knighted separately.Sir Elton John, for example, has a CBE but has also been made a Knight Bachelor, along with other celebs such as Sir Bruce Forsyth and Sir Ian McKellen.Only Brits can be made a Knight Bachelor, but foreigners can be awarded an honorary KBE. Anyone selected for an honour will be invited to attend an investiture ceremony at a royal residence where the Queen, or sometimes Prince Charles, Prince William or Princess Anne, will award them with their insignia - a medal - of the order.This usually takes place a few months after the honours list is announced, but recipients can start using their new title or letters after their name as soon as the awards are announced.Members can also have a special element added to their coat of arms showing their membership of the order. Famous people to have rejected honours include David Bowie, who turned down an OBE in the Queens birthday honours in 2000.Stars to decline OBEs include celebrity cook Nigella Lawson, comedy duo French and Saunders and Fawlty Towers star John Cleese.John Lennon is one of the few recipients to return his honour, sending back his MBE in 1969 in protest against Britains involvement in the Nigerian civil war."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-9.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"720\" width=\"960","title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"So if youre after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further.Sign up to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun 10 - Receive the 10 biggest and best stories of the day, as selected by our editors, sent straight to your inbox so you’re always in the know.Money - The best deals and advice for you and your family.Fabulous - All the hottest trends in fashion and beauty, celeb news and juicy real-life stories.Football - The best columnists, unmissable highlights from your favourite players and clubs and more.TV\u0026ampShowbiz - Get all the latest celebrity and TV news directly into your inbox.Even better, the newsletters learn what you like, so over time you’ll see more of what you want and less of what you don’t.

Here’s more about them and what they do.Renowned for their discipline and courage, Coldstream Guards are infantry soldiers who specialise in light role operations.These include performing reconnaissance, operating machine guns and mortars, and engaging enemy troops on foot and in light vehicles.This versatility makes the regiment one of the most important fighting units in the British Army.Coldstream Guards also have a ceremonial role as protectors of the royal palaces, including Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace.The Regimental Band of the Coldstream Guards is one of the oldest and best-known military marching bands in the world.It is the oldest continuously serving regiment in the Army, with origins that date back to the English Civil War.The regiment was formed in 1650 as the Regiment of Foot under the command of George Monck and was part of Oliver Cromwell’s New Model Army.It became known as the Coldstream Guards in 1670, upon the death of General Monck.The 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards has answered the call of duty at almost every conflict with British involvement, including Operation Herrick in Afghanistan and Operation Telic in Iraq.The regiment’s motto is “Nulli Secundus” meaning “Second to None”.In general, Battalions have two Colours used for their flags.The First is known as The Royal or Queen’s Colour and the Second is usually called the Regimental Colour.The Queens Colours for the 1st Battalion has a crimson background and bears the star of the Order of the Garter in the centre with the Imperial Crown above.In addition, 47 Battle Honours are arranged in vertical rows on either side of the centre.The Regimental Colour has the Union Flag as its background.In the centre is one of 24 Company Badges ensigned with the Imperial Crown.A further 47 Battle Honours are arranged in vertical rows on either side of the central Company Badge.In the upper left corner, next to the pike is the Battalions number in Roman numerals.The 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards has been given the honour of Trooping its Colour for the Queen’s Birthday parade this year on June 9.Trooping the Colour is a military parade which goes all the way back to the 17th Century.On the day, the battalion will have to perfect hundreds of precision drill moves and put on their best uniform display.The Trooping the Colour parade officially begins when the Queen leaves Buckingham Palace in a carriage.Until 1987, she would make this journey riding side-saddle on a horse, dressed in the colours being trooped that year.The Monarch then travels down the Mall in front of crowds towards Horse Guards Parade at Whitehall, near to Downing Street.On arrival, she is greeted by a royal salute from the soldiers on parade, before inspecting the troops.Then, the colours being trooped are carried down the ranks and showed to the soldiers.The Queen then leads the troops back down the Mall to Buckingham Palace for a second salute, marking an end to the official trooping.After the ceremony, the Queen is joined by other members of the royal family on Buckingham Palaces famous balcony for a 41-gun salute from neighbouring Green Park, following by a Red Arrows fly-past.Her Majesty has taken part in the ceremony every year since her coronation, except in 1955 when it was cancelled due to a national rail strike."},{"url":null,"title":"rapper ms dynamite recognised with mbe for services to music in the queens birthday honours","story":"The Mercury Prize-winning artist, born Niomi Arleen McLean-Daley, burst onto the scene with earworm hit Dy-na-mi-tee, which featured on her 2002 debut album A Little Deeper.Her album won critical acclaim in the UK and US, and saw her win Brit Awards for Best British Urban Act and Best British Female Solo Artist in 2003.After taking a break to have her son Shavaar, the musician returned in 2005 with her second, politically-informed album Judgement Days featuring a plea to Tony Blair on the track Mr Prime Minister.She retreated from the spotlight in 2006 after being arrested outside a London nightclub and sentenced to community service.The 37-year-old later took on guest-hosting at BBC Radio 1Xtra and appeared on ITVs Hells Kitchen and Sky Ones The Race.After winding down her music career, she has featured on television and in recent years appeared on Katy Bs Lights On track, as well as Magnetic Mans Fire.She released drum and bass track Cloud 9 with DJ Shy FX in 2013.In 2016, she was honoured with a Paving the Way MOBO award for her contribution to music as a female MC.A paving stone was laid in her honour at her alma mater, the WAC Arts College in Belsize Park.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is not your fault. Ask Daddy!”Can you imagine how that little girl must be feeling?She’s lost her mother and some have surmised the note appears to point the finger at her dad.It’s obviously not at all clear if that was really Kate’s intention, or whether she just wanted her daughter to seek answers and comfort from her father.That’s the trouble with suicide. Those left behind have to deal with so many unanswered questions.Look at little Ariane, who has just lost her beloved dad and will also be left with feelings of confusion and anger, as well as searing grief.Anthony, 61, was an award-winning chef and TV presenter.He was in France filming an episode of his successful CNN series, Parts Unknown, when he was found unresponsive in his hotel room.He was a larger-than-life, passionate character who championed the underdog and supported his girlfriend Asia Argento, one of the first actresses to accuse Harvey Weinstein of rape.Both Kate and Anthony were successful and, as far as the rest of the world was concerned, were living the dream.But no one really knows what goes on behind closed doors.Kate, who was 55, met husband Andy 35 years ago.They were married for 24 years but had been living apart for the past ten months, while sharing parental duties.They hadn’t discussed divorce and Andy said they still loved each other very much.He went on to say there was no indication that Kate was going to kill herself and his priority now is to protect and comfort his daughter.He will not only be grieving but inevitably feel he should have been able to somehow prevent this tragedy.People have asked “Who in their right mind would leave their own child to grow up motherless?”, but that’s the point.Kate wasn’t “in her right mind” and it seems neither was Anthony.People who kill themselves are suffering mental distress that no one can understand unless they have walked a mile in their shoes.On the surface, Kate had it all. Many thought she was still happily married. The couple had a healthy daughter, her designer label was a massive success.Kate was also good looking, funny and always seemed happy in interviews and photos. But now we know the poor woman was in agony.According to members of her family she had suffered from mental health problems for many years, and there has been speculation she was reluctant to seek help.If this was the case, then the reasons put forward for Kate trying to cope on her own are heartbreaking.She was apparently worried that her business, based on her cheerful handbags, would be affected if it was known she suffered from anxiety and depression. That really is desperately sad.Not only was Kate trying to cope with her demons but her marriage was going through a rocky patch and all the while she felt as though she had to paint on a smile and pretend everything was fine.Her life became so unbearable that she believed her only escape was to end it all.Her husband has said she was undergoing treatment and taking medication, yet Kate’s death shows that despite a change in attitudes towards those unfortunate enough to suffer from mental health problems, there is still a very long way to go.There are still people who will tell sufferers who are clearly very unwell to man up, or pull themselves together, which is just about the worst thing you could do.Suicide is a growing problem and each death is a tragedy. It is the biggest killer of men aged 20 to 49 in the UK. At least 84 men will have taken their own lives this week.If so many people were being lost to a virus there would be a national outcry and funds would be made available to find the cause and cure.Mental illness is still a Cinderella disease, and that cannot continue.But there are glimmers of hope.On TV we’ve seen the effect of Aidan Connor’s suicide on his friends and family in Coronation Street. It was tough to watch but raised awareness on a massive scale.We have seen raw grief but also deep anger and Aidan was branded selfish by his distraught sister.Those closest to him have experienced guilt because they didn’t realise how much pain he was in and have suffered sleepless nights and have been torturing themselves for not knowing how bad it was and for not offering help.Corrie shone a light in a dark place and I believe this storyline and the tragedy of Kate Spade and the apparent suicide of Anthony Bourdain will make people think.None of us knows what private battles are being fought against the dark demons of mental illness, even among our family and close friends.We all need to be watchful and unafraid to ask if everything really is OK. We need to be prepared to be rebuffed but to gently persist if we feel there is a real problem.The black despair that it seems Anthony Bourdain and Kate Spade succumbed to could happen to any one of us.If you feel depressed, please, I beg you, be brave and ask for help. And let’s all be prepared to reach out to that person in despair.I FIND it utterly ludicrous that in the eyes of the law a criminal who steals your pet is treated in exactly the same way as if they stole your TV or sofa.There’s no consideration for the fact that your dog or cat is a living, breathing animal and a much beloved member of the family.If the thieves are caught, although unlikely in these days of police cuts, the monetary value of the pet is the only consideration when it comes to sentencing.This is bonkers. You simply cannot put a price on your pet.So I am delighted that a campaign to change the law is gaining momentum.What all concerned dog and cat lovers want is higher sentencing for the theft of our animals and to reclassify stealing a pet as a crime in its own right.Hopefully this would act as a deterrent to pet theft, something alarmingly on the increase.One of those who passionately wants the law to change is Sir Bruce Forsyth’s daughter Debbie Matthews.Back in 2006, both her dogs were stolen from her car.She appeared on GMTV with her dad to make a heartfelt plea begging for the return of Yorkshire terriers Gizmo and Widget.Thankfully, within hours of appearing on the show, people who had bought the dogs in good faith at a market realised they were stolen from Debbie and she was emotionally reunited with them.It was a traumatic time for the whole family and Debbie knows she was incredibly lucky her story had a happy ending.So many owners never see their pets again and are left with endless worries about their fate.If you want to help change the law, do sign the pet theft petition at petition.parliament.uk/petitions/212174 and make your voice heard.IT was impossible to take the p*** out of Peter Stringfellow, because he would be first to make fun of himself.He knew his habit of wearing tiny thongs made him look daft, and was well aware that his mullet haircut was old-fashioned and silly and that people considered him to be a bit naff.When he was pilloried, he just gave one of his big guffaws and carried on enjoying himself.Peter was funny, kind-hearted and generous to a fault.He bore his illness with great stoicism and bravery and will be sadly missed.POLDARK returns to our screens tomorrow night amid a row over what many in Scotland refer to as “taps aff”.This occurs on those wonderful, albeit rare, occasions when the sunshine beams warmly north of the border and allows chaps to remove their cagoules, sweatshirts, woolly jumpers and tops.Aidan Turner, who plays Captain Poldark, is probably one of the most famous exponents of “taps aff” in recent times, ever since those sweaty scything scenes in his first series.It turns out that it was Aidan’s idea to take off his cambric shirt and scythe away in those tight breeches.But it’s caused the mother of all rows, with admiring women being accused of “objectifying” the bold captain.I have thoughtfully reproduced an image of a topless Aidan so you can make up your own minds.You will either think this photograph adds to the joy of a Saturday or be horrified by the sexualisation of the poor, unfortunate man.Frankly, I’m happy to wallow in this fantastic view and look forward to tomorrow, BBC1, 9pm, when I can enjoy some cracking writing, proper acting and top production values.Those “taps aff” scenes only enhance the pleasure of Poldark and, don’t forget, no one forced Aidan to show his pert nipples.He knows full well he’s a handsome fella and it was all his choice, for which we are truly grateful.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Unless your child is taller than 135cm or over the age of 12 then they legally need to be in a car seat. And quite apart from the law, kids\u0027 car seats save lives and prevent serious injuries. When riding a bike it\u0027s important to have the right safety gear too. Although there is no legal requirement to wear a helmet, recent research shows that wearing one significantly reduces the risk of sustaining a head injury. Child Safety Week is designed to help parents and carers understand how best to keep kids safe and Halfords has an amazing range of bike and car equipment that will help. From car seats to bike lights there\u0027s lots of gear to keep your little ones safe on the road and lots of in-store expert advice to help you fit what you buy. Car safety: Babies and toddlers    Very small children need additional protection and modern car seats offer a lot of features to keep your baby as safe as possible – for example, extra neck and head supports mean that they are protected in an impact. The Joie Spin 360 is versatile. It can be rear-facing for infants up to 9kg and switched to forward-facing for kids between 9 and 18kg. It rotates so you can get your baby out of the car easily and it has five recline settings for both forward and rear-facing modes. ISOFIX compliance means it mounts to hard anchors in your car for maximum safety. Car safety: Older kids  Once your kids weigh more than 15kg they need a group 2-3 booster seat. These are adjustable to allow your children to use them up until 12 years or a weight of 36kg. After that weight, they can rely on normal car seatbelts. The Joie Trilo Inkewell has washable seat covers (crucial, given the amount of time they\u0027re used for and how messy little ones can be) and offer side impact protection and an adjustable headrest. There\u0027s even a cupholder! If you don\u0027t have ISOFIX mounts in your car then the Halfords Highback Booster Seat offers excellent protection and are secured by the car\u0027s seatbelt. There\u0027s an included cupholder, washable cover and adjustable headrest. It also has side impact protection too, as you\u0027d expect.  Halfords also has an in-store car seat demo and fitting service too, which will help you learn how the seats need to be fitted and ensure they’re compatible with your car. Car safety: High-backed or backless boosters There are two different kinds of booster seat on the market. High-backed tend to have more advantages which include supporting a child’s head, allowing them to sleep and protecting them in an accident. High-backed seats also help to keep the seatbelt correctly positioned on children, especially smaller kids. Backless booster seats are, on the whole, cheaper though and may suit older and larger children slightly more than those with backs. Bike safety: helmets    The first thing any young cyclist needs is a helmet. Young kids might like to choose a fun design and Halfords has Polka Dots , princesses , stars or even an absolutely awesome skull design, along with a range of fun colours. Prices start at \u0026pound10. Older kids might like the Mongoose Urban Helmet, which looks cool and offers excellent protection. It\u0027s also available in either black and white, to suit their style. Halfords has a great range of helmets and in-store experts can help you find the right helmet for your little one.

The admission is buried in an 82-page research report that was quietly slipped online today while MPs are away from Parliament. Charities demanded reform after the shock findings about Universal Credit, which rolls six benefits into one monthly payment. Tory ministers boast modern and flexible UC is fairer and will ensure work pays. More than 800,000 new claimants are already on the benefit and existing claimants will start being moved to it from 2019.  Yet the survey reveals 44% of claimants were either falling behind with bills or experiencing real financial difficulties three months into their UC claim. That figure reduced by just a fraction to 40% for people who were eight or nine months into their claim. In one group, a third of claimants admitted they took money from friends and family, while 11% applied for a bank overdraft. Others were forced to use charities, payday loan firms and doorstep lenders, the survey confirmed. Meanwhile just over a third (35-36%) were in arrears on housing costs. And for almost half of those people (44%), the arrears had got bigger by the time they were eight or nine months into their claim. Child Poverty Action Group chief executive Alison Garnham said the figures show Universal Credit is a dismal failure.  It is clear that there are still many people who months into their claim, are being left with too little to live on, she said. Universal Credit once had strong poverty-reducing potential but big funding reductions have meant it is failing to achieve its original aims. Many of its design faults have been allowed to go uncorrected. Unless funding for Universal Credit is restored and its design re-visited, this once flagship benefit will continue to fail. The survey involving 4,202 people was carried out by IFF research for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) between March and September last year.

The Prime Minister was left humiliated at the G7 after her Foreign Secretary suggested Donald Trump would do a better job of Brexit. But the PM appears powerless to stop him - even though he broke Cabinet unity rules. This time last year, Theresa May threatened Mr Johnson by warning no minister was unsackable. Yet today, battling several Brexiteers in her Cabinet, she was unable to repeat the threat.  Asked if Boris Johnson was unsackable, she told Sky News: The foreign secretary Boris Johnson has strong views on Brexit. She was asked the same question again at the G7 summit in Canada, but she dodged it again. The Prime Minister said: He has strong views on Brexit but so do I. That’s why I’m getting on with the job of delivering what the British people want, Brexit, for us to leave the European Union, to take back control of our money and laws and our borders, but ensuring that as we do that we are building a brighter future for our country.

The former Liverpool striker and manager, 67, is knighted for services to football, charity and the City of Liverpool. Also honoured are screen stars Emma Thompson and Keira Knightley, ex-University Challenge host Bamber Gascoigne and rapper Ms Dynamite. The list is full of hundreds of unsung heroes, from counsellors and a Holocaust survivor to Britain\u0027s longest-serving poppy seller. But there are also fatcat bosses of Royal Mail and Network Rail whose gongs are likely to prompt accusations of rewards for failure. Here is the 2018 Queen\u0027s Birthday Honours List in full. Honours in numbers  In total, 1,057 people have received an award. Of the total number recognised in the Queen’s Birthday Honours list this year, 210 have been made an OBE, 392 an MBE, and 318 awarded a BEM. There are always rows over gongs for cronies and the establishment, but 71% of honours went to everyday community heroes. Meanwhile 11% work in education, 12% in health, 13% in industry, 3% in science and technology and 5% in sport. Just under half the recipients (49%) are women, while 10% of all those on the list are from ethnic minorities. The biggest names Kenny Dalglish  Liverpool football legend Kenny Dalglish heads a host of the great and the good receiving gongs in the Queen’s birthday honours. The former striker and manager, 67, who was at Hillsborough when 96 fans were killed in 1989, becomes a knight. The 67-year-old Glaswegian and his wife Marina have helped raise millions of pounds for charity after she successfully battled breast cancer. Sir Kenny joked he thought the letter was from the taxman - and told the Mirror he will still be very much the same person after the honour. “It doesn’t feel right. It doesn’t feel comfortable. No-one will be calling me that anyway,” he smiled.  Jermain Defoe celebrated an OBE by paying tribute to best friend Bradley Lowery, his six-year-old “best friend” who died last year. The former England striker struck up a moving relationship with little Bradley during his time at Sunderland as the lad battled a rare type of cancer. The Premier league star, whose award recognises the work of the Jermain Defoe Foundation in St Lucia, told the Mirror: “It was a special relationship. Over the years playing football, being lucky enough, being blessed and realising you are role models, there are a lot of kids who look up to you.”  Keira Knightley will receive an OBE for her services to drama and charity. The royal honour comes more than 15 years after the twice Oscar-nominated film star scored her breakthrough role as a football-loving teenager in Bend It Like Beckham. Since then, Knightley, 33, has gone on to star in Pirates of the Caribbean, Love Actually and Pride \u0026amp Prejudice.  One of Britain\u0027s most acclaimed actresses, Emma Thompson, is made a Dame for services to drama after winning Oscars, Baftas, Golden Globes and Emmys. The 59-year-old has been a star since the 1980s in The Remains Of The Day, Howards End, Harry Potter films and the Nanny McPhee films. Born in 1959 to an acting parents, she studied English at Cambridge and joined comedy troupe Footlights alongside Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie. A human rights activist, Greenpeace and Labour supporter, she lives with husband Greg Wise, daughter Gaia, 18, and a son, Tindyebwa Agaba, a Rwandan orphan they informally adopted in 2003 when he was 14. Anthony Joshua  World heavyweight champion boxer Anthony Joshua is made an OBE for services to sport. It is the second honour for the star, who is just 28, after he led a team of Olympic gold medallists receiving MBEs in 2013.  Tom Hardy, who receives a CBE for services to drama, made his name on the big screen with a series of hard man roles. The 40-year-old actor is known for Inception, Mad Max: Fury Road, Bronson and The Revenant. But the privately-educated star has a hard-bitted back story in real life too. He has spoken about how he went off the rails with alcohol addiction, checking himself into rehab in 2003. He\u0027s been clean ever since. I went in thinking I\u0027d do it for a little bit until I can go out and drink and people forgive me. But I did my 28 days, and after listening to people who had been through similar circumstances I realised I did have a problem, he previously told the Mirror. Mark Carne  Network Rail boss Mark Carne – blamed for bungling new timetables which have left passengers stranded and delayed – collects a CBE for services to the rail industry. Meanwhile the number of trains either cancelled or more than 30 minutes late on Northern and Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) routes averaged 11% and 13% respectively in the first two weeks of the new timetables. Mr Carne said in a statement last week that timetables were finalised “significantly later than normal for reasons that were both within and without our control”. He continued: “It has not been good enough and we know it.” Moya Greene  Another corporate boss accused of being rewarded for failure is Royal Mail chief Moya Greene, who becomes a Dame. The Canadian dubbed “Moneybags Moya” oversaw the 2013 privatisation of the service. In the same year, she was forced to hand back a shocking \u0026pound120,000 housing perk. She was given the money to help her buy a home as part of a lavish \u0026pound1.5million pay and perks package last year. She steps down later this year with almost \u0026pound1million - a cash payment equivalent to 12 months’ base salary, which was \u0026pound547,800 last year, as well as a payment equivalent to her expected annual bonus of \u0026pound367,000. Kazuo Ishiguro Author Kazuo Ishiguro said he is proud of Britain, its open, democratic traditions and literary culture after being awarded a knighthood for services to literature - less than a year after winning the Nobel Prize. His acclaimed works include The Remains Of The Day for which he won the Man Booker Prize. The 63-year-old said: I\u0027m deeply touched to receive this honour from the nation that welcomed me as a small foreign boy, that educated me and nurtured me. At this uncertain moment around our globe, I remain proud of Britain, its open, democratic traditions - and its wonderful literary culture in which I\u0027ve been allowed to participate. Ms Dynamite  Rapper and singer Ms Dynamite is honoured with an MBE - under her real name Niomi McLean-Daley. The 37-year-old who burst onto the scene with earworm hit Dy-na-mi-tee in 2002 is recognised for services to music. She retreated from the spotlight in 2006 after being arrested outside a London nightclub and sentenced to community service. Since then she has featured on TV, guest-hosted on BBC radio and appeared on Katy B\u0027s Lights On track. Mark Rowley Following a wave of terror attacks which struck the UK in 2017, former assistant commissioner of the politan Police Mark Rowley, who led the national response, is honoured with a knighthood. On his retirement in March after 31 years in policing Mr Rowley was praised by Prime Minister Theresa May for his dedication to protecting public safety and tackling the evils of terrorism. Politicians  Among the politicians honoured are Conservative deputy Commons speaker Eleanor Laing and Tory Brexiteer Bernard Jenkin, awarded a damehood and a knighthood respectively for their political and public service. Labour\u0027s Louise Ellman has also been made a dame for parliamentary and political services. Britain\u0027s richest billionaire  Britain\u0027s richest billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, the boss of chemical company Ineos who is worth \u0026pound21.05 billion, receives a knighthood for services to business and investment. The firm’s Grangemouth refinery was at the centre of the most bitter industrial disputes in recent years when it was threatened with closure in 2013, triggering a major rift with the unions.  Alpine skier Menna Fitzpatrick is the youngest on this year\u0027s list, picking up an MBE for services to Paralympic winter Olympic sport. The Welsh star is just 20 but she\u0027s already Britain\u0027s most successful winter paralympian after learning to ski aged five. She gained slalom gold, super combined silver, giant slalom silver and super-G bronze at this year\u0027s Winter Paralympics. The oldest - Britain\u0027s longest-serving poppy seller  Former Second World War nurse Rosemary Powell, who at 103 is the oldest on the list, is made an MBE for voluntary service. She has spent an astonishing 97 years collecting for the Royal British Legion Poppy Appeal, and announced she will hang up her collecting tin just days ago because she feels she is “getting old”. Rosemary was just six when she began selling the Royal British Legion poppies on Remembrance Day in 1921 – the year the appeal was first held. She said: We did it in memory of those men who were killed – for their sacrifice. Sadly war has had a significant impact on my life.”  Best of the rest Renowned war correspondent Kate Adie is made a CBE for services to media, while Stacey Dooley, known for her BBC Three investigative series covering topics ranging from the fight against Isis to the abortion debate, receives an MBE for services to broadcasting. Thriller writer Ken Follett gets a CBE and TV presenter and Britain’s best-known classicist Professor Mary Beard collects a Damehood. Waterstones founder Tim Waterstone is now a Sir. Holocaust survivor Ber Helfgott, also known as Ben, is knighted for services to Holocaust remembrance and education. Chief Scientific Officer for NHS England Professor Susan Hill is made a dame for services to the 100,000 Genome Project and to NHS Genomic Medicine, while surgeon Nadine Hachach-Haram is awarded a BEM for services to surgery and innovation, having co-founded a company pioneering virtual access to surgery for people in remote areas. Judy Naake, who made millions selling St Tropez self-tanning products, initially from the back of her car, receives an MBE for services to entrepreneurship, the community and philanthropy. Jo Malone, creator of the self-titled luxury perfumery brand who has since started the fragrance-centred Jo Loves business, is awarded a CBE for services to the British economy and the GREAT Britain campaign. But no Grenfell honours this time While there are no honours for local heroes involved in the response to the Grenfell Tower fire, the Cabinet has said it expects acts of bravery and extraordinary community spirit which emerged from the tragedy to feature on future lists, adding that its approach will be time-appropriate.

Rosemary was honoured just a week after stepping down after 97 years of collecting for the Royal British Legion appeal. She first helped her mother sell poppies for the Royal British Legion’s inaugural Poppy Appeal in 1921 aged only six. The great-gran, from London, plans to hang up her collection tin this year because she is “getting old”. “It is very nice that I have been given this,” she said. “I still vividly remember selling poppies on Richmond Bridge with my mother.” The brother of aid worker David Haines, who was murdered by Islamic State extremists, is made an OBE for his work against terrorism.  Mike Haines dedicated the honour, for voluntary service to tolerance and education in the UK and abroad, to his younger sibling, who was beheaded by Islamic State extremists in 2014 after being taken hostage in Syria. Haines, of Dundee, said: “It means a great deal to me and my family. “Nonetheless, I want to be clear that this award is not about me, but for all those who have supported the Global Acts of Unity campaign and the values it stands for. “Like many of those receiving awards today, I stand on the shoulders of those who support me.

Sister Imelda Poole, president of Religious in Europe Networking Against Trafficking and Exploitation, is made an MBE for services to combating modern slavery. The nun previously spent many years helping vulnerable people in the UK including in Manchester, Glasgow and Middlesbrough. Sister Imelda said: “This is an honour which I accept on behalf of the female religious and co-workers who are contributing, through the mission of many international networks such as RENATE, to combating modern day slavery and on behalf of the dedicated staff of Mary Ward Loreto in Albania who are passionate in this same cause. “May this award expose even further the terrible crime of human trafficking which, as Pope Francis has declared, is a crime against humanity itself.”  A Muslim woman hopes her MBE “silences the haters” who contribute to Islamophobia. Mum-of-three Akeela Ahmed, 39, said last year’s terror attacks fuelled Islamophobia.

Sir Kenny, who managed Liverpool at the time of the Hillsborough disaster in which 96 of the team’s fans died, said he was “hugely proud to have accepted the accolade”. The Glaswegian and his wife Marina have also helped raise millions of pounds for cancer treatment through the Marina Dalglish Appeal after she successfully battled breast cancer. It has raised more than \u0026pound10million to set up an oncology centre at University Hospital, Aintree. Joking that he thought the letter informing him of the knighthood had been from the taxman, he added of the achievement: “We only set out to do the best we possibly could, even through all the other stuff - the charity or Hillsborough, it was to help people because somebody helped us.”  Newly-knighted Sir Kenny Dalglish saw crown-headed letter land on doormat - and thought it was from the taxman   The citation for the honour specifically referred to his inspirational work in supporting the families of the bereaved Hillsborough victims, and his work in support of the quest for justice, which culminated in a judgement of unlawful killings of the victims. Sir Kenny told of his pride at the recognition for his family, and the people in Liverpool and Scotland who have always supported him. “When I was a young boy in Glasgow I wouldn’t have had the words to give this honour due testimony, but we are hugely proud to have got this and for the people who have worked so hard to get here,” he said. “We are immensely proud as a whole family to have got it but everyone should feel proud because they have all played a very important role in what we’ve done and where we have got to.”  He insisted he will still be very much the same person after the honour, and admitted he will feel strange being addressed as Sir Kenny. “It doesn’t feel right. It doesn’t feel comfortable. No-one will be calling me that anyway,” he smiles. “I don’t think it makes me any different. It’s for yourself and for everyone who has been associated with you through the years, from your parents to your professional career.  “Obviously a lot of people must have pushed my name forward for the accolade, which is hugely humbling but also very gratifying as well.” He also spoke of the pride his mum Cathy and dad Bill would have felt about his incredible journey from Glasgow’s East End where he was born, to Buckingham Palace and a knight of the realm. “As a parent myself if one of my kids went that far you would be hugely proud of them, wouldn’t you? I don’t think they would be any different to anyone else,” he said. “Your parents are the ones who set you off in the world.  “They put you in the right direction or the wrong direction, and thankfully for myself and Marina we got pushed in the right direction. “We met great people from then on in. It doesn’t do you any harm when you meet good people. “It’s just lucky, it’s life’s journey. We’ve been lucky.” Veteran war correspondent Kate Adie is made a CBE for services to media.  Businesswoman Jo Malone, famed for her fragrant candles, is awarded a CBE for services to the British economy and a campaign encouraging people to visit and invest in the UK. Japan-born Nobel prize-winning author Kazuo Ishiguro, knighted for his services to literature, said he was “deeply touched to receive this honour from the nation that welcomed me as a small foreign boy”. Controversially, Britain’s richest man Jim Ratcliffe, the boss of chemical company Ineos who this year topped the Sunday Times rich list with \u0026pound21.05 billion, receives a knighthood for services to business and investment.

Rumours are swirling that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are staying at Ashford Castle, a luxury estate once voted the ‘best hotel in the world’ Locals reported that the grounds of the hotel were on lockdown and that helicopters were circling overhead. A heavy security presence was reported and visitors were unable to enter the sprawling grounds of the castle, located in the town of Cong, County Mayo.

The royal couple, who have just returned from their honeymoon in Canada, have leased the former cowshed, according to the Daily Mail. Situated in the Cotswolds, the barn has been given a 21 century makeover. Fifteen years ago it was used to house cattle on a vast 4,000 acre estate.  Now each of the buildings have been radically revamped into a spectacular countryside residence. The abode is believed to contain a split-level kitchen as well as a spacious dining room.  The bedroom, which boasts views of the surrounding valley, has a dressing room as well as an en-suite bathroom. The Duke and Duchess\u0027 reported getaway, which has not been identified for privacy reasons, is said to be on the huge Great Tew Estate.  The grounds, which were once a Roman farm, possess an impressive history. It was given by William I to his half-brother Odo, bishop of Bayaeux, following the 11th century Norman conquests.  It is now owned by multi-millionaire Nicholas Johnson, an Old Etonian who has sough to revitalise its fortunes by refurbishing many of the building on its land. The estate is situated near the affluent Oxfordshire town of Chipping Norton which counts former Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson and former Blur bassist Alex James as residents.

The rules start early on, as apparently the little royals don\u0027t get to sit with the mum and dad at official dinners - including Christmas. Instead, they\u0027re sent to the children\u0027s table with the other little ones.  According to Harper\u0027s Bazaar the royal kids aren\u0027t allowed to sit with the adults until they have learned the art of polite conversation.

To mark turning 92, she will attend a concert at the Royal Albert Hall in her honour. With a line-up of every great grandmother\u0027s dreams (or nightmares), she will be entertained by performers from Sir Tom Jones to Shaggy and Sting to Kylie Minogue, Craig David, Anne Marie and Shawn Mendes - plus the BBC Concert Orchestra. And it will all be shown live on BBC One. But as you might have heard, the Queen actually celebrates two special days - and what is traditionally the bigger deal is actually still to come. The monarch having two birthdays is a measure that was introduced 250 years ago, and it\u0027s still going strong. Here\u0027s all you need to know about why the Queen gets two days to mark her birthday every year instead of one. When are the Queen\u0027s birthdays?   The Queen was born at 2.40am on April 21 at her maternal grandfather\u0027s London house, 17 Bruton Street .  But she also has an official birthday in June - usually on the second Saturday. This year it falls on Saturday June 9.  No. It is all down to the British weather. Since 1748, the monarch\u0027s official birthday has been marked by the parade known as Trooping the Colour - usually held on the king or queen\u0027s actual birthday. But Edward VII, who reigned from 1901 to 1910, was born in November. He celebrated officially in May or June because there was less chance of it being cold and drizzly during the outdoor event. The monarch after Edward VII - George V - helpfully had a birthday in June, but the Queen\u0027s father, George VI, whose birthday was in December, reintroduced the tradition of an official birthday, which Elizabeth II has continued. Is her official birthday always on a Saturday?  It is now. George VI had his official birthday on the second Thursday of June. In 1959, after several years on the throne, the Queen changed it to the second Saturday for convenience. It can now be on either the first or the second, and sometimes the third Saturday of the month and is marked by Trooping the Colour carriage and horse procession in central London and a fly-past over Buckingham Palace. The Queen\u0027s Birthday Honours List is also announced, the Union flag flown from Government buildings and gun salutes at noon. What does she usually do on her actual birthday?  She usually spends it privately - except when duty beckons or it is a milestone celebration. On her 90th, she carried out a birthday walkabout in Windsor and in the evening lit a beacon before joining her family for a lavish black-tie dinner in Windsor Castle. Aides do try to give the Queen a break on her birthday from the famous red boxes containing state papers. And on her official birthday?  It is a busy affair with the Trooping the Colour ceremony, which ends with key royals appearing on the Buckingham Palace balcony.

From children\u0027s author Roald Dahl to film director Alfred Hitchcock, 277 people declined the Queen\u0027s Honours in the New Year or Birthday Honours lists from 1951 to 1999, the Cabinet Office confirmed in 2012. Since that official list of those who had declined honours were first published, it has become increasingly common for celebs to reveal their refusal. Before that, it had been relatively rare to do so. While people have explained their decision to turn down honours in many different ways, a number have cited the honours system’s links to empire. How do you refuse an honour? Nominees are asked by Downing Street if they will accept well in advance, and are usually able to reject the offer without going public. Several personalities said a polite ‘no’ to the Queen on more than one occasion. So who exactly has turned down the Birthday Honours, here we take a look at the big names who have rejected the award. Who has refused Birthday Honours? Back in 2003, a list of living celebs who had refused gongs had been leaked, including David Bowie and Helen Mirren (though she later accepted a damehood). French and Saunders  The comedy pairing turned down OBEs for services to comedy drama in 2001. It was only later they explained. Saunders said: “If I felt I deserved a Damehood I’d accept it,” she told Source magazine. “At the time, we felt that we were being paid very well to have a lot of fun. It didn’t seem right somehow. “We didn’t deserve a pat on the back. It felt a bit fake to stand alongside people who devoted their lives to truly worthy causes.” David Bowie  Bowie himself later explained his decision not to join the list of musical knights including Sir Mick Jagger, Sir Paul McCartney and Sir Elton John. He said: “I would never have any intention of accepting anything like that. I seriously don’t know what it’s for. It’s not what I spent my life working for.” When asked about Jagger accepting the honour, he said: “It’s not my place to make a judgment on Jagger, it’s his decision. But it’s just not for me.” Nigella Lawson  The celeb chef turned down the offer of an OBE in 2001, though it\u0027s not known why. Benjamin Zephaniah Poet Benjamin Zephaniah explained his public refusal in 2003. He wrote: “OBE, me? Up yours, I thought. I get angry when I hear that word ‘empire’: it reminds me of slavery, thousands of years of brutality.” “I am not one of those who are obsessed with their roots, and I’m certainly not suffering from a crisis of identity my obsession is about the future and the political rights of all people. “Benjamin Zephaniah OBE - no way Mr Blair, no way Mrs Queen. I am profoundly anti-empire.” Stephen Hawking  In 2008 Hawking said he had been approached with an offer of a knighthood in the late 1990s, but had turned it down. It was later said it was down to the government\u0027s dealing with science funding and cuts. Paul Weller The musician rejected his CBE in 2006. In a statement his spokesperson said: “Paul was surprised and flattered, but it wasn’t really for him.” Lynn Faulds Wood In 2016, former BBC watchdog presenter Lynn Faulds Wood turned down an MBE and suggested that the honours system needs updating to reflect the modern world. She said: “I would love an honour if it didn’t have the word ‘empire’ at the end of it. We don’t have an empire.” John Cleese  The Monty Python star was offered a CBE in 1996 but said they were silly. He was offered a peerage by Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown in 1999 - he declined because he felt staying in England during the winter months to fulfil his role as a working peer was too much of a price to pay. George Harrison The former Beatle turned an OBE down in 2000 - after Paul McCartnery was awarded a knighthood. Every Beatles member was awarded an MBE in 1965, though Lennon returned him. It\u0027s thought he was put forward for his contribution to music, but there was speculation that Harrison would have been insulted that McCartney got his knighthood three years before. “Whoever it was who decided to offer him the OBE and not the knighthood was extraordinarily insensitive,” friend Roy Connolly told the Independent. “George would have felt insulted – and with very good reason.” Ken Loach Ken Loach turned down an OBE in 1977. His films focus on social issues such as poverty and homlessness. He told the Radio Times in 2001. “It’s all the things I think are despicable: patronage, deferring to the monarchy and the name of the British Empire, which is a monument of exploitation and conquest. “I turned down the OBE because it’s not a club you want to join when you look at the villains who’ve got it.” Howard Gayle  Howard Gayle, Liverpool FC’s first black player, also turned down an MBE, saying it would be a \u0027betrayal’ of Africans who suffered as a result of the empire and that his “ancestors would be turning in their graves.” He was nominated for his work with Show Racism the Red Card. Taking to Facebook he said: “This is a decision that I have had to make and there will be others who may feel different and would enjoy the attraction of being a Member of the British Empire and those 3 letters after their name, but I feel that It would be a betrayal to all of the Africans who have lost their lives, or who have suffered as a result of Empire.” Jon Snow  Having declined an OBE in 2000, Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow went on to make a documentary in 2002 entitled ‘Secrets of the Honours System’. He remains critical of the use of ‘Empire’ in our honours system. “I tried to find out why I’d been given it and was unable to get a clear answer or, indeed, to find out who had proposed me, he said afterwards. Alan Bennett Alan turned down the offer of a CBE in 1988 and rejected a knighthood in 1996. The author and playwright said the reason was he couldn\u0027t carry off being a knight. “I felt that, in my case, it just wouldn’t suit me, that’s all. It would be like wearing a suit every day of your life.” Jim Broadbent Jim Broadbent was offered an OBE but he turned it down as he felt it should go to those who help others. In 2012 he said: “I was offered an OBE a couple of years ago, but I said, ‘no’, and turned it down.” “I’m not that comfortable with actors receiving honours, partly because I think they ought to go to those who really help others, he told the . “Besides, I like the idea of actors not being part of the Establishment. “We’re vagabonds and rogues, and we’re not a part of the authorities and Establishment, really. If you mix the two together, things get blurry.” LS Lowry  Lowry declined five honours – an OBE in 1955, CBE in 61, knighthood in 68 and invitations to be a Companion of Honour in 1972 and 76. Friend and fellow artist Harold Riley said when the list was revealed in 2012 that the painter did not have “anything against the system”. He said: “He indicated he didn’t wish to change his situation by something being latched on to him.” Riley said Lowry was a “very private person” and may have wanted to protect his privacy. Danny Boyle Danny Boyle, director and man behind the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony, turned down an honour because he thought it was was wrong. It\u0027s just not me, he said. He added thousands were involved in executing the ceremony. “You can make these speeches about ‘this is everybody’s work, blah blah blah’, he said. “And you’ve got to mean it, and I did mean it, and it is true, and it’s the only way you can carry on something like that: through the efforts of all the people. “I don’t know whether I’ll ever get invited back to the Palace.” Aldous Huxley Aldous Huxley, author of classic novel Brave New World, snubbed a knighthood in 1959. Evelyn Waugh Evelyn Waugh, who wrote Brideshead Revisited among other famous titles, refused a CBE in the same year. Roald Dahl  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory author Roald Dahl rejected an OBE in the 1986 New Year’s Honours. Trevor Howard The actor Trevor Howard, star of romance Brief Encounter, would not accept a CBE in 1982. In 1979 the Labour Prime Minister Jim Callaghan’s wife Audrey refused to be made a Dame. It was the year Mr Callaghan led Labour to defeat against Margaret Thatcher’s Tories. However, Mrs Callaghan later acquired a title when her husband became a peer in 1987. Hughie Green The Opportunity Knocks star Hughie Green refused an OBE in the 1960 New Year’s Honours, when he was at the height of his fame as presenter of Double Your Money. Michael Frayn Author and playwright Michael Frayn turned down a knighthood in 2003, and a CBE in 1999, for a simple reason. He said: “I haven’t done this for reasons of modesty. I like the name Michael Frayn it’s a nice little name to run around with. I’ve spent 70 years getting used to it and I don’t want to change it now.” Ian McDiarmid Ian, known for playing Palpatine in Star Wars, turned down an OBE, but it\u0027s not know why. Prime Ministers  Former Prime Ministers Sir John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have all declined life peerages. Sir Winston Churchill reportedly declined being created Duke of London because he wished to remain in the House of Commons. Stars who refused an award - but later accepted them  Psycho and The Birds director Hitchcock turned down a CBE in 1962, but accepted a knighthood just before he died. Sculptor Henry Moore, the son of a coal miner, refused a knighthood in 1951, but became a Companion of Honour in 1955. Conversely actor Robert Morley, who accepted an OBE in 1957, rejected a knighthood in the 1975 Birthday Honours list. And Hugh Cudlipp, who edited The Daily Mirror in the 50s and 60s turned down a knighthood in 1966, although he had accepted an OBE in 1945. Artist Lucian Freud declined a CBE in 1977 but went to Downing Street to paint the Queen’s portrait.  Poet Philip Larkin refused an OBE in 1968. Nobel Prize winner Francis Crick turned down a CBE in 1963, before accepting the Order of Merit in 1991. Lenny Henry accepted a CBE from Tony Blair but refused an honour from John Major.

And millions of fans — a few of them men — will tune in tomorrow to BBC One for the return of the hit period piece. Series four promises more close encounters, with even the new doctor stripping to rival the captain’s charms. But Cornish culture buffs, and fans of the books on which the drama is based, will be focusing on the history.  Many will ask: “Who was the real Ross Poldark?” Author Winston Graham, who died 15 years ago at 95, was inspired by real events and characters as he wrote his 12 romantic novels, starting in 1945. He admitted Poldark’s facial scar and “physical characteristics” were based on a injured flying officer he met on a train during the Second World War — but he claimed there was never one real Ross.  Yet there is a historic Cornish character whose life bears striking similarities to the tricorn hat-wearing hero.  And rather worryingly for Aidan Turner fans, his selfless fate would be a dream storyline for TV scriptwriters looking for a shock finale. His name was Thomas Hawkins, a wealthy 18th-cen\u0026shy\u0026shytury mine-owner who cared for workers’ wel\u0026shy\u0026shyfare, just like Poldark. He married for love before he and wife Anne lost two children in tragic circumstances — while Ross and Demelza saw their baby Julia, die from diphtheria. He was also an MP — and viewers will remember that our hero has promised to go into politics to fight for justice. Thomas’s descendant, Michael Galsworthy, who lives on the family’s 300-year-old estate near Truro, cer\u0026shy\u0026shytainly sees the similarities.  And the author told him his characters were based on Cornish “gentry” akin to his ancestors. Michael said: “I met Winston during a lunch. “We were discussing his novels and he explained that he used people like Thomas and Anne Hawkins when creating his characters.” Thomas was born in 1724, son of a leading barrister and public official. He went to Pembroke College, Cambridge and, at 23, became MP for the Grampound constituency. He inherited the Trewithen estate from his uncle Phillip, also a barrister. Thomas owned lucrative tin mines which employed hundreds of people and took great interest in their welfare. He fell in love with Anne Heywood — a brunette not a redhead like Demelza — whose father agreed they could marry so long as his architect got the job of doing up their mansion. The couple went on to have four sons and one daughter. But tragedy struck when their eldest son John, 13, drowned in the Thames while at Eton.  Thom\u0026shy\u0026shy\u0026shy\u0026shyas and Anne brought his body home preserved in a barrel of brandy. Their anguish must have matched that portrayed by Turner and co-star Eleanor Tomlinson in harrowing scenes as Ross and Demelza’s daughter died from “putrid throat” in series one. Tragedy struck the Hawkins family a second time when another son died of “a fever in consequence of eating an ice-cream after dancing”. And Thomas’ sense of responsibility for the people who worked for him resulted in his own premature death in 1766 at the age of 42.  At that time, smallpox was a killer but treatment was being developed. Thomas volunteered to have an early form of vaccination as an example to his tenants. Tragically, he contracted the disease and died. His second son Christopher, inherited the estate when just eight years old. He went on to become High Sheriff of Cornwall, an MP and in 1791 was made a baronet by William Pitt the Younger.  Fascinatingly, Sir Christopher became a recurring character in the Poldark novels, depicted as corrupt and cynical but generous to his friends. All Graham’s books were inspired by stories he uncovered in 18th-century newspapers, letters, diaries and autobiographies. He said: “In all classes of historical novels, one has to have a degree of historical truth as well as a truth to human nature.” And he added about his Poldark books: “I do not know how near the truth of life in the 18th century these novels are. All I know is that they are as near to the truth as I can make them.”  Ross links to Battle of Waterloo officer Some fans believe another real-life hero may have influenced the character of Poldark. Ross is a British Army officer and American Revolutionary war veteran who returns to his native Cornwall and becomes an MP. Author Winston Graham’s notes reveal that he researched the life of Lieut Gen Sir Richard Hussey Vivian, a Cornishman, Battle of Waterloo veteran and politician.

Fearing children were losing their ability to socialise, French politicians have passed a “detox” law. It means pupils under the age of 15 will not be able to use mobile phones anywhere on school grounds from September. But will it achieve anything? Or could it harm children’s development? Here a parent and an academic debate whether we could learn lessons from across the Channel. Would banning phones from schools in this country be a miracle for attention spans in the classroom or a backwards step?  YES says Mirror writer and mum Eva Simpson Mobile phones have no place in schools and I applaud the ban on French students using them on school grounds. Many UK headteachers have imposed an unofficial ban since they were given the right to confiscate items from pupils in 2007. But I would be happy to see the law changed so they were forbidden in all schools here. Children need to be able to disconnect from the digital world that is such a big part of their lives. From the moment they wake up – for many it is the first thing they see as they use them as alarm clocks – to the time they go to bed, children are connected to social media, games and YouTube and many don’t have the maturity to switch off. Let’s face it, most adults don’t know when to switch off. I reluctantly gave my 12-year-old son my old smartphone. It’s a \u0026shydecision I regret. It is the cause of so many arguments in our house. There are regular rows about why he can’t have an Instagram or \u0026shySnapchat account when “all of his friends have it”. I’m made to feel guilty that he is missing out, but so far, I have stood my ground. I caved into his request to \u0026shydownload the video game Fortnite, the latest online craze – and every spare minute he gets is spent playing the game with his friends, virtually. I’d rather he read a good book. Evenings can be stressful, and I usually end up switching off the broadband.  If he could, he’d play “just one more game” for hours. And why wouldn’t he? These games encourage users to keep playing. These days children hang out with their friends in the digital world rather than in the real world. No wonder childhood obesity is rising. Mobile phones have made our lives easier, but they’ve also caused issues for young people. Scientists at the University of Korea in Seoul found children addicted to their phones were more likely to have mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. A study by the London School of Economics in 2015 found that a ban on mobiles in schools had the effect of giving pupils an extra week’s education over a year. Test scores rose 6%. With so much evidence about the negative impact of phones on children, banning them in schools is the only sensible thing to do.  NO says Peter Twining, Professor of Education at the Open University and former teacher Before we rush to follow the French government’s decision, we need to ask a really simple question: what are schools for? If we think they are about teaching our children to deal with the world and make the best of it, then banning smartphones makes little sense. We’d never dream of not teaching road safety, stranger danger or healthy eating in school. As so many parents know, the internet is where children spend so much time interacting with the outside world – for good and evil.

The Cardiff-born Instagram star boasts more than 164,000 followers on his social network’s AvantGardeVegan feed, as well as over 250,000 subscribers to his YouTube channel. And the 26-year-old, who is known for creating uncanny vegan versions of well-known meat dishes, thinks sites such as Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest are leading a boom in healthy eating. He also dismissed suggestions vegan food is boring. Talking as he launched his latest collection of plant-based recipes inspired by new smoothie brand AdeZ, he said: “I think there’s a lot of knowledge and information out there these days about healthy eating, and social media’s really helped that.  “Social media is such a great platform to use just to get inspiration. “Things like YouTube are amazing. I can film a recipe and post it out to people from all around the world. “Instagram particularly has helped turn everyone into a foodie. All you have to do is go to a restaurant and see people snapping pictures of their food. And I just think that platform is great to show off food. People get really creative.’’ He added: Social media has also made the world smaller which is great particularly for the vegan community because I’m able to reach people in all parts of the world and show them how simple and how great vegan food can be. So even if you’re not a foodie, you can go on Instagram, Pinterest or YouTube, find people like myself and other amazing vegan influencers out there, or just general foodies who are putting up exciting food. You can get inspiration from there whether it’s for your evening meal or a weekend meal - there’s so much inspiration out there these days.  When he was asked if vegan food was boring, he replied: Vegan food is so flavoursome. We’ve got such an array of beautiful fruits and veg and other ingredients there’s no reason for it to be boring.’’ The handsome culinary genius first fell in love with life in the kitchen at the age of 15 when he did work experience at a hotel in Cardiff. He quickly impressed colleagues who gave him the nickname ‘Gordon’ after his hero Gordon Ramsay.

He said: It would have to be Gordon Ramsay because he was a childhood inspiration, particularly when I was a chef. I did see on his Twitter recently he said he was going to give vegan a go.

Now at the age of 101, the legendary Dame Vera Lynn is about to fulfil her next ambition – to get her very first Brit Award. After her last album out-sold the likes of Katy Perry and Lana Del Rey last year, Dame Vera is nominated in two categories for next Wednesday’s Classic Brit Awards, and is already guaranteed a statuette – as she will be presented with the Lifetime Achievement honour. But while she is being recognised for lifting the nation’s morale during the Second World War, Dame Vera fears today’s youngsters do not know or appreciate the depths of horror endured by Allied troops and those at home. “With all that we have today, I think it has become difficult for young people to fully appreciate the hardships we endured during the War,” she says. And in a time when the country is so divided, many may also never understand the genuine feeling of camaraderie that prevailed.  “It was hard, but it was also fulfilling,” Dame Vera says.  “Everyone was there to help their neighbours and anyone else who needed it. We were fighting shoulder to shoulder, here and abroad.” It may have been seven decades and several generations since VE Day, but Dame Vera is still top of her field. Her album, Vera Lynn 100, sold more than 100,000 copies last year. But she will not be going to the Classic Brits ceremony at Royal Albert Hall in London herself.  Instead her daughter Virginia, known as Ginny, will collect the award on her behalf.   She is also up against Sheridan Smith for Female Artist of the Year and Bradley Walsh and Andre Rieu for Classic FM Album of The Year, so could end up with three awards to put on her mantelpiece. “It’s humbling,” she says. “I’m delighted people still enjoy my music all these years later.  “I never really considered what I’d be doing at this stage of my life. However, it was definitely a wonderful surprise to be honoured.” Dame Vera still keeps up with the industry, saying of Katy Perry: “I am aware there are a lot of talented performers out there today. I wish them all every success in their careers.”   And talking about newer acts, she says: “As for any advice, I’d say the most important thing is to stay true to yourself, persevere and remember to enjoy performing.” Her own career resonates way beyond music.  Brought up in East Ham, East London, her dressmaker mum and plumber dad encouraged her to sing in working men’s clubs in London’s East End from the age of seven. She left school at 14 for a short stint of factory work, but her singing proved far more lucrative and soon eclipsed her parents’ earnings. Dame Vera’s first record, Up the Wooden Hill to Bedfordshire, was released when she was 18 and became a radio hit with troops and their families during the dark war times.   Knowing the public looked to her to uplift the nation during its war effort, Dame Vera worked tirelessly visiting troops on the frontline and in military hospitals. Her biggest hits, We’ll Meet Again and White Cliffs of Dover, moved listeners to tears then and still do now. Dame Vera says: “I was aware my music had made an impact, particularly as the words spoke to the nation’s \u0026shysentiments during that time. “I mainly felt honoured to be able to do my bit for the War effort. “I never felt under any pressure from anyone. I only did what I wanted to do. And I wanted to go where no one else went. Where it was most needed.” It is a mark of Dame Vera’s inner steel that she insisted management let her go where no other women, or singers, dared.  She sang for the troops in Egypt, India and Burma when she was 27.   Burma holds very precious memories for Dame Vera, who considers her performances there her greatest achievement. “Entertaining the boys in Burma was something that I will never forget and will remain a highlight of my life,” she says. “I was very proud to have the opportunity to visit the boys who listened to the programmes.  “It was a chance to see them in their own environment and take them a little bit of home. Although I was visiting the frontline, I never felt like I was in any danger as the boys looked after me so well.”  After peace in Europe, Dame Vera travelled to Germany to sing for troops who had liberated the concentration camps.  She said: “They took me around the ovens. I saw the gas chambers. They were like a row of garages with steel doors. No birds were flying. They said the gas was still in the air.” Throughout her career, Vera’s husband Harry Lewis was by her side as her manager.  They met when both were members of the Bert Ambrose Orchestra, married in 1941 and five years later, had daughter Ginny.

Shizuka Matsuki, 46, went missing at Silver Lakes Rotary Park in Davie, Florida, on Thursday while walking her two dogs. One witness said he spotted a huge 10-foot alligator in the are where the woman is reported to have gone missing. She\u0027s missing and when the witness went to the area, he immediately spotted a large alligator, a spokesperson for Davie Police said.  Trappers from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission captured and cut open the animal after spending hours looking for it in a nearby pond.  They discovered the arm inside its stomach but have not yet confirmed if it belongs to the victim. Ms Matsuki’s body has not been recovered by search teams.   According to reports, her dogs have refused to leave the side of the lake without their owner. Her dogs won’t leave the pond, Davie Police Maj. Dale Engle told the Sun Sentinel. One of her dogs got bit by the gator.  Emergency responders found one of the woman\u0027s dogs with a \u0027large, fresh wound\u0027 when they arrived at the scene.

Amber Luke, 23, from Australia, says she\u0027s been addicted to tattoos since she was 16 and now has more than 50 - including ones on her eyeballs. She\u0027s even had her tongue split in two and had her earlobes stretched in an incredible body transformation. The young woman says she has no regrets whatsoever about her extreme makeover.  Amber - dubbed \u0027Blue Eyes White Dragon\u0027 told Daily Mail Australia that she\u0027s absolutely in love with my image. She said: I got the name \u0027Blue Eyed White Dragon\u0027 from my friends, they call me that because I resemble a dragon with my eyes and tongue. I see myself as very plain looking when looking at before and after photos, I absolutely hated the way I used to look. I was boring. Amber frequently shares pictures of her unusual look with her 21,000 Instagram followers and says she got her first tattoo seven years ago. She said: As soon as I turned 16, I was inspired by those around me to get tattooed. I craved to know what the feeling was like.  I developed an addiction at 16 years of age. By the time I hit 18, I already had three tattoos. And when I turned 18, I decided to get my first big piece. Now, I have over 50 tattoos, I haven\u0027t been able to count all of them. Clearly determined to achieve her desired look, Amber even risked going blind to have the whites of her eyes tattooed. She revealed: The procedure for getting my eyes done was only 40 minutes. It was very intense and very painful. My eyes got held open while a syringe was injected into my eye four times per eye. I was blind for three weeks.

wrestling fans, Hell for Lycra, which attracts more than 1,000 fanatics into the Caird Hall, has been given the green light for later this summer.The event has welcomed some of the world’s most famous former WWE stars such as Million Dollar Man Ted DiBiase, Rowdy Roddy Piper, Tatanka, and Hacksaw Jim Duggan.It had been feared the event would have to be cancelled as organiser David Low, who runs Scottish Wrestling Entertainment, had been unable to obtain a licence to put on one of his similar but smaller events at the city’s Ardler Complex.The council said “previous incidents at similar events” had raised safety concerns meaning paramedics and specialist insurance would be needed – bringing extra costs which Mr Low said were “unaffordable”.Branding the new rules “absurd”, Mr Low also said this essentially meant the authority was defining wrestling as a sport.Although the flagship event will go ahead on August 18 as originally planned, the council has so far refused to budge on its stance on the organisation’s other events.Mr Low said he was pleased Hell for Lycra is going ahead but added the smaller shows are “crucial” to raise funds for the year’s biggest

constantly people coming around the house, other people from the opera would all come around, drink some wine and sing some songs,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220It was mainly classical music that I was interested in when I was very very young.\u0026#8220If there was ever any children\u0026#8217s parts, me and my sister would get dressed up and thrown on stage, I sure to enjoy that.\u0026#8220There was never much singing involved, it was mostly just being children running around on stage.\u0026#8221Tristan said he started playing the cornet when he was four or five, and

high school.\u0026#8221While he trained and began working as an engineer, he started DJing electronic and hip-hop music, later moving into scratch DJing.\u0026#8220Some of my friends had a band and my best friend had just been asked to be the drummer so he asked if I wanted to come along and do some scratching on top of the music,\u0026#8221 he said.After a few weeks, Tristan asked if they were ok

Dundee secondary schools, who discussed her life and issues facing young people today.Youngsters from Baldragon Academy, St John’s RC High School, Harris Academy, Grove Academy, St Paul’s RC Academy,

delivering the promotion to the Premiership and the financial stability we all want.“I’m not evading the ‘elephant in the room’ but really can’t answer any of the questions many of us have on the reported potential takeover/ investment in the club.“ArabTRUST are taking the view at this stage that a lack of information is a positive sign that any negotiations are taking place in a business-like manner and when it’s possible the club will bring us all up to date with any developments.“Too many times in the past we’ve seen gossip drip fed into the media on all sorts of issues where ultimately everyone has been left frustrated and disappointed.“We must also remember any discussions of this nature will be private discussions between shareholders and potential other

for dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United’s search for new centre-backs continues apace as former Dundee defender Julen Etxabeguren and ex-Tannadice man Callum Morris have been added to their list of targets.Both are free agents, though, the Tangerines face a battle to land either signature.Etxabeguren was released by the Dark Blues last month after an injury-hit year and has returned to Spain.Whether he can be enticed back to Scotland remains to be seen, although, he did enjoy his time in Dundee.Morris, meanwhile, told Dunfermline he was leaving them to return to England but a move back to former club United might be enough for him to shelve those plans.The 28-year-old played 45 times for Jackie McNamara at Tannadice over two seasons but, like Etxabeguren, has a history of injuries.He did play 40 games last season for the Pars, however.Also on the list is former Partick man Frederic Frans.The Belgian centre-back is wanted by his former club also, as well as fellow-Championship side Ross County.Meanwhile, United have announced their first pre-season friendly.Csaba Laszlo’s men will head to Brechin City on Tuesday, July 3, kick-off 7.45pm.That sees both city clubs heading to Glebe Park in pre-season because it’s the only grass pitch in the area, apart from Arbroath.n Former Dundee United favourite Nadir Ciftci is leaving Celtic at the end of this

Leonard, 59, has lived close to Menzieshill Wood – known as the quarry – for 18 years and said the grass is the worst he has seen it.Vincent said: “The grass is so overgrown you can hardly see your dog at times. It is knee high in patches. It hasn’t been cut this year.“From what I’ve been told by environmental health, the entire quarry should be getting cut completely once a month.“I was told the whole lot of it would get done every month, and it’s not been done.“The last couple of years they have been doing what they call ‘picture framing’ – cutting the edges but not the middle – this year they just did the path.“It is that bad at the moment, it needs it all done.”Vincent said he has complained in the past and within hours somebody has visited the site to cut it.He said he walks his dog, Jack, round the quarry four times a day, and that occasionally, even when the Jack Russell is on a lead, there are times when he cannot see him.He added there are a lot of new houses being built in the area and that children come down to play in the woods.He said: “The kids are rolling in it, it’s that long. You don’t know what they are rolling in.“I have been told there is broken glass but I haven’t seen it myself.”He says he has been in touch with the council, which has not responded, and also contacted a local councillor who has also not responded.“They just planted about 70 trees there so I don’t know if that is their excuse not to cut the grass,” he added.“In the past there have been dogs hurt.“The grass has never been so bad before. I have lived here 18 years and never seen it this bad.“There is a fair bit of dog mess. I’m very frustrated.”A Dundee City Council spokeswoman said: “We are undertaking improvement works in this area, and have planted additional plants and trees. This is an ongoing project and we will be looking at ways to make the area more attractive for people to enjoy and this will involve cutting the grass.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1a516c449eb.jpg ","title":"jack hamilton signing a great bit of business says derek soutar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSigning 24-year-old Jack Hamilton is “a great piece of business” according to a man who knows a thing or two about keeping goal for Dundee.Derek ‘Soapy’ Soutar had two spells at Dens Park, totalling eight years, and has seen first-hand how good Hamilton can be.After Soutar suffered an injury in his time at Forfar back in 2012, a young keeper by the name of Hamilton came in on emergency loan to cover at the age of 18.Watching his progress since, Soutar was delighted to see him arrive at Dundee.Soutar said: “I was very surprised Hearts let him go.“He came in on loan at Forfar when he was just 18. He was a great size, very athletic and a really good shot-stopper, great at one-on-ones and his distribution was excellent, too.“With Jon McLaughlin leaving I thought it would be the ideal chance for Craig Levein to put Jack in for pre-season.“He’s moved on, though, and Dundee have a great signing.“I worked with Jack, he’s a great lad and really down to earth personality.“I think it’s a great bit of business by Neil McCann.“He’s a good age with plenty of experience as well at Hearts and all the different levels with Scotland.“It’s a massive signing for Dundee – he could be there for years to come.“He will have to bide his time, though, because Elliott Parish did really well at the end of last season after Scott Bain left.“Every goalie is going to have times when it’s not going for you but Elliott got through that and didn’t do a lot wrong. He’ll take some shifting for Jack.“What it will do is push Parish to be as good as he can because he knows Jack will be breathing down his neck.”After a steady first season at the now renamed Kilmac Stadium, Parish will feel he’s the current No 1 at the club but the arrival of another senior goalie can spur both to excel – and that’s good news for the Dark Blues.Hamilton has represented Scotland at every age level from U/15 to U/21 and was called up to a squad by Gordon Strachan in May 2016.He didn’t get a first senior cap but Soutar reckons he can push his way back into the national set-up by impressing for Dundee.He added: “Not so long ago he was in the Scotland squad.“He maybe lost a bit of confidence last season at Hearts and being on the bench.“He’s very professional and will push himself to the max to make sure he’s ready for pre-season at Dundee.“He’s very level-headed, he’s not one for the big-time if you know what I mean, he’s not a flashy kind of guy.“I know the kind of level Jack can play at, I’ve worked with him and I think he could get himself back in the Scotland set-up while at Dundee.“Whatever fee was paid, he’ll definitely justify it.“Further down the line, he could even get Dundee a fee if he moves on so, for that reason, I think it’s a great piece of business.“Working with (goalkeeping coach) Rab Geddes every week, too, can only bring the best out in Jack.“A three-year deal gives him security and playing for a manager who wants him in Neil McCann will help no end.”The former Dundee and Aberdeen goalie, meanwhile, is still going strong with his Derek Soutar Goalkeeping Academy.“It’s still going really well,” he added. “That’s us had 38 goalies over seven years go on to play pro-youth and we’ve had one recently go out to the US for a scholarship.”Any budding young goalies can find out more on the academy’s Facebook page.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b17b6e6b90a2.jpg ","title":"manchester united boss jose mourinho watches dundees former arsenal midfielder glen kamara amid transfer speculation","story":"\t\t\t\t\tJose Mourinho was watching as Dundee’s Glen Kamara picked up his fourth international cap in Finland’s friendly defeat in Romania.The 22-year-old has drawn plenty of interest in his time at the Dark Blues – Mourinho, however, was only there as a guest of Romanian agent Ioan Becali and stressed in an ad-hoc TV interview he wasn’t looking at players, just enjoying his time off.Kamara, meanwhile, despite only joining up with the Finnish national squad on Monday, played the majority of the second half in Ploiesti.The Finns, ranked 62nd in the world and not at this year’s World Cup, started the friendly match well but fell behind in the first half to Cristean Manea’s 37th-minute strike.In the second period, Kamara made his entrance after 57 minutes for Nottingham Forest’s Thomas Lam but almost immediately the team fell further behind.On 61 minutes, winger Ciprian Deac finished from close range to give the Romanians a home victory.Finland boss Markku Kanerva said: “The start was challenging but we looked good. We fought well and did not give up.“Of course, we should not be satisfied with this result but we did not have a full squad.“At the end, we got a little bit to attack more.“I had to think a little about the team when Pyry Soiri and Glen Kamara were only involved on Monday for the first time so they only played the second period.“There was little to be done in the last third.

He’ll seem like a new signing if he can rediscover the form that helped Hamilton, Hearts and Hibs gain promotion to the top flight.Verdict: Looking good up top.Overall: With just 18 first-team players on the books, work is obviously still to be done but initial signs look promising. Adding solid defenders, however, is vital.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"social work report for man who drove on three dundee roads while disqualified","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA man had sentence deferred

We\u0026rsquove got the most roads and schools and most of them in the poorest condition.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease. Help us fight back on all fronts by funding research to eradicate the disease, raising awareness and supporting survivors.That would be the perfect wedding present.Find out more at www.MeningitisNow.org and search for Time 4 Tea.Elaine Close, community fundraiser, Meningitis NowSir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street be kind enough to contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29, and his movements in the immediate aftermath.We are both keen to know that this young person is alright as she appeared to be terribly frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs as he headed straight for her.Knowing she was now fine would put our minds at rest.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity.

These had a variety of riding and control of paces challenges including an unusual off piste element using the quarry area of the field.Judge Debbie Hay Thorburn was very impressed with the independent riding of the youngest members who tackled all the tasks with confidence and determination.

In fact many of the passing ferry passengers stopped to watch from the road.The new timing equipment, purchased with aid of a grant from Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust, was in full use by judge Mairi Henderson and made for more professional accuracy in timing aspects.The final Grand Prix had only two competitors but it was a masterclass of style and competence from Jojo and Katie which made it a joy to watch.As usual the event ended with some fast and exciting games and after the field was cleared there was the prizegiving in the Pony Club’s brand new blue tent.The Junior Trophy for the day was won by Louise Ralston from Campbeltown and Iris McMillan from Tayvallich took the Senior Trophy for a second year while the non-members trophy was won by Andrea McShannon.Pony Club PonyClass 11 Frazer Prentice, Firefly2 Louise Ralston, Nero3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceClass 21 Willow Ryan, Ryan2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, ColeyClass 31 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Katie MacKay, Eva3 Josephine Boase, ValerieClass 41 Andrea McShannon, Nicole2 Julie McLeish, Eclipse3 Shelagh Oakes, Pery4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyShow JumpingStars of the Future \u0026#8211 Lead Rein1 Louise Ralston, Nero2 Frazer Prentice, Firefly3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceStars of the Future1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, Coley4 Willow Ryan, RyanNewcomers1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Michelle McAloon, Eclipse4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyDiscovery1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Katie MacKay, Eva4 Michelle McAloon, EclipseGrand Prix1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Katie MacKay, Eva\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"springwatch spotlight on tarbert","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 07/06/18, 12:17 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert has featured on the popular BBC nature show Springwatch.An underwater segment stirred up a buzz on social media with its inside look at the colourful world just beneath the waves.Diver and cameraman Andy Jackson took to the bottom of Loch Fyne to view what he called ‘an underwater garden’ and the wonderful creatures within.The segment was aired on Tuesday June 5 and is available on BBC iPlayer for a limited period.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/06/18, 4:46 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.This week\u0026#8217s photograph comes from Jacqui Barker of Tarbert.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

She died because there was no match, but I signed up because of her.\u0026#8217Brett received his transplant in October 2015 and, after a long recovery, is now healthy and well.The identity of recipient and donor must be kept confidential for two years, to protect them both, but the pair exchanged cards, giving Brett and David the chance to learn a bit about each other.Then, on Sunday June 3, the long-awaited meeting took place in Campbeltown.Brett continued: \u0026#8216I had butterflies before we met.

The ‘Highway Services’ would be located at Bogend Toll near Symington and could create 30 jobs. A Shell petrol station and Londis shop are part of the vision for the site. A raft of documents have been lodged with South Ayrshire Council as part of a planning application. London-based Grove Garages is behind the proposal, which would see two buildings erected.   The company has an agreement with Shell and Londis but is still in talks to sign-up a coffee firm.  The plan includes eight fuel pumps, 11 parking spaces, two car wash bays and pumps for HGVs.  The coffee shop would have a floor space of 260sqm with 29 car spaces and a drive through at the back. A supporting statement said: “The location of the site represents an ideal opportunity for a roadside servies area to cater for the frequent tourist, haulage and commuter traffic using the A77. It said the development would ensure the “reuse of a visually and environmentally poor site in a prominent location alongside one of Scotland’s main tourist routes, the A77.”  The site used to be a field belonging to Dyke Farm. Access to the site would be from the B730 adjoining the A77 north bound carriageway. Cars could enter from the southbound carriageway through the existing flyover. Chargers would also be available for electric cars. A design and access statement said: “The proposals give back purpose to an unused site, which has potential to provide an important service to the local area and indeed the wider area. The design proposals are considered to be respectful to the local environment and are in line with local policy and guidelines. No decision has been made on the application yet.

Following a long battle with neuroblastoma, the 17-year-old died peacefully surrounded by dad Chris, mum Connie, and sister Olivia. It was a fight that captured not just the hearts and minds of Ayrshire, but the world beyond. Vanessa, who displayed courage which belied her condition, would rarely be seen without a smile on her face. For almost a decade, her name became synonymous with the fight against the aggressive cancer. Almost \u0026pound1million was raised with the aim of sending Vanessa abroad for life-saving treatment. That dream was realised and in January 2013, the family received the news they longed for – that the cancer was in remission.  Vanessa would return to school and rejoin classmates as a hugely popular figure at Marr College. Life, as normal as it could ever be, was good again for this inspirational girl. But the cancer would return and spread to Vanessa’s brain, with her family receiving the crushing news that her condition was terminal. As ever, Vanessa fought bravely until the last before she passed away just days short of her 18th birthday. Now her family are vowing that her fight will live on in her legacy. Dad Chris told the Post: “We are devastated at our loss.  “Vanessa was a huge inspiration to Connie, Olivia and I and so many more. “She achieved lots during her short but fulfilled life, she did everything she wanted to do and lived life to the full. “She never complained about anything, even though her situation was dire and she knew it. “We are privileged to have had such an inspirational and beautiful daughter.”  Vanessa’s funeral will take place on Friday, June 22 at 11.30am at Dreghorn Crematorium and then on to Troon Town Hall for a Celebration of Life. Chris added: “We’d like to ask that people wear bright colours and for the gents not to wear black ties. “That is what Vanessa would have wanted.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12539593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/14478946.jpg","title":"lawrence shankland agrees new deal","story":"NewsLawrence Shankland agrees new deal to stay at Ayr United for Championship pushThe 29-goal striker has put pen to paper on a new deal at Somerset Park.\u0026nbspShareByStuart WilsonLochlin Highet13:14, 15 MAY 2018Updated13:18, 15 MAY 2018NewsShankland is staying on at Somerset (Image: Daily Record)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLawrence Shankland insists money can’t buy happiness after he sensationally spurned a host of lucrative offers to pen a new deal at Ayr United. The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision.

The pair lost touch over the years but were reunited six years ago. Kim said: “We started chatting as friends but it became apparent the spark was definitely still there between us and a few months later we moved in together. “It was a whirlwind romance - within a year of meeting we had moved in together, got engaged and had a beautiful baby boy.  “We then had another baby in 2016 and it was then we decided to start planning the wedding.” The couple tied the knot at The Vu in Bathgate on Mother’s Day, March 11 this year. Kim said: “We were a bit panicky about the weather as the week before the wedding was storm Edna and everyone was snowed in. “There was still some snow lying around on the wedding day but the sun was shining. “The wedding day was an emotional day from start to finish it was full of tears and laughter and genuinely was the best day of our lives!” The bride wore a Maggie Sottero ‘Lisette’ dress from Opus Couture in West Kilbride, as well as veil and hair piece.

He competes in the mainstream tennis ranks and is in the top 10 for the South/West Scotland overall.

Anthony said: “We are very proud of him. “A lot of people now do fundraising for national charities but the local ones don’t get as much exposure or sponsors.

But they’ve been caught out by golfers incensed South Ayrshire Council has not passed on any benefit of a government zero VAT ruling on leisure. In February HMRC announced there was to be no VAT on council provided leisure activities. And that will include swimming, gym use and bowling at Northfield. But South Ayrshire Council has not let any of its customers know. If effectively means golf charges have soared 24% on last year, rather than the 2.7% the council have boasted about. It means that golfers paying the \u0026pound429 season ticket price would be expecting a \u0026pound71.50 reduction for VAT.  Tory councillor Peter Convery is blasting the move as “sleekit.” And he said: “Surely people are entitled to get some money paid back to them? “This is about principle and this is sleekit. “This is peoples’ money and should never have been included in the original ticket charge. “It is very unfortunate the council cannot see this to any great extent.” In East Ayrshire, where leisure is provided by an arm’s length trust, VAT is necessary on charges. Details of the VAT grab emerged in an email between a golfer and Councillor Brian McGinley.  The golfer, who preferred to remain anonymous, said: “I do not think the majority of season ticket holders will be enamoured to discover that a significant element of their season ticket fee is actually related to a cost that SAC no longer have to bear.” Ayr East councillor McGinley said in the email: “I have ascertained that VAT has been included within the price of a season ticket up until February 18 this year. “Following a court ruling against HMRC whereby sports services provided by local authorities are now classed as exempt for VAT purposes, VAT is no longer remitted to HMRC when income is received for season tickets etc.” A council spokesman would not explain why they had not revealed the VAT windfall, if players can expect a refund or whether is was just being used to mask a huge leap in prices.  He would only say: “We work hard to ensure our golf and leisure provision continues to offer great value for local people and visitors and this is reflected in our current charging structure. “The funding from entry fees and season tickets only makes a partial contribution to our overall operating costs – with the remainder coming directly from Council subsidy – and the 2.7% price increase on last year’s fees reflects the Consumer Price Index. “Reducing inequalities within our communities is a key commitment for the Council and we have extended the concessions available under the Access to Leisure card scheme – which includes a 15% discount for all South Ayrshire residents. The change in VAT application for Council leisure services contributes towards the costs of that important scheme, which will help improve health and wellbeing across South Ayrshire, as well as helping reduce the net deficit cost of running Council leisure services, which was almost \u0026pound11 million in 2016/17.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"troon church help build new","story":"NewsTroon church to help build new school for hurricane victimsThe Troon church has raised £170,000 to help transform people’s lives in Haiti.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley14:28, 7 JUN 2018NewsPastor Richard Woods with Minister Rolex visiting Muirhead Primary (Image: Copyright unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Building a school for hurricane victims was once a dream for Seagate Church.

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it. Laird Girdwood, was a larger-than-life character and also one of the prominent proprietors. He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade. Meanwhile James Ker lived with his wife at Red Lion House in Biggiesknowe. Their toft was more than half an acre in size with a barn whose gable end faced the street and a single-storey cottage attached. Parts of the barn were rebuilt\ninto a new dwelling house.\nThe barn itself is not without interest being the one scene of Laird Girdwood\u0026rsquos Venison Feast to which all the residents of the Northgate were invited everyone, however, to bring his own beverage.\nIt was a resounding success\u0026mdash\u0026ldquoNever before did the rafters ring with such glee. was the reported account of the event.\nA traditional forge and a modern purpose-built engineering workshop were built as well as a \u0026lsquospec\u0026rsquo tenement of four dwellings.\nWrought iron work was much in evidence, with a large garden behind and a rustic rockery at the front of the property. It was then given the name \u0026lsquoKer Place\u0026rsquo after the fashion of the time for such businessmen of which there are several examples in Peebles.\nThe cottage (pre 1823), which is still in place, became part of the enterprise and judging by the size of the lathe bed and fire-scorched rafters some serious work went on there.\nIt also incorporated James Ker\u0026rsquos dispensary for his veterinary work. James had been a student of William Dick at his Edinburgh Veterinary College which he had established at his father\u0026rsquos forge in Clyde Street in Edinburgh where the bus station now stands.\nHe obtained his diploma to practice as a veterinary surgeon and was also made a Fellow of the Edinburgh Medical Veterinary Society for his \u0026ldquovaluable contribution to veterinary science. This may have been in connection with a product he sold commercially as \u0026lsquoKer\u0026rsquos Alterative Sheep Pill\u0026rsquo.\nIt must have been effective since it was still being sold in the 1930s by his son, John Ker. He, also a blacksmith, had qualified as a veterinary surgeon nearly forty years after his father at what was by then called the Royal \u0026ldquoDick Veterinary College.\nJames and his wife died at a young age and his brother and sister, Charles and Elizabeth, carried on the business successfully as well as raising James\u0026rsquos family of two boys.\nJohn Ker, as said, served his apprenticeship as a blacksmith and also qualified as a veterinary surgeon. About 1916 the smiddy closed when the farriers went to war.\nJohn Ker served as a captain with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and on his return practiced locally as a veterinary surgeon until he died after a short illness towards the end of 1938. The smiddy, itself, \u0026ldquodid its bit during hostilities, by billeting troops.\nIt did not reopen after the war and operate at its former level of business as blacksmiths and engineers. It did, however, remain in general use and is currently a joiner\u0026rsquos workshop.\nJohn Ker was also the last \u0026ldquoBoxmaster (minute secretary) of the Peebles Incorporation of Hammermen\u0026mdashthe blacksmiths\u0026rsquo once exclusive and powerful guild.\nIt fell to him to record in the minutes, rather regretfully, \u0026ldquoThere was no meeting and no dinner held in 1927\u0026mdashfitting, his forebear had been one of the founding signatories we believe.

\u0026ldquosunny and hospitable city whose residents love fishing, football, boat rides and beaches.\nAnd as the site of one of the most famous, and most bloody, battles in the Second World War, it is a symbol of Russian patriotic pride.\nOfficial estimates put the victorious Red Army\u0026rsquos dead, wounded, missing or captured at around 1.1 million, while Axis casualties and prisoners are

It might make you laugh.Somewhere along the line, in the last five or six years, the world seems to have developed a serious crack in its funny bone.And I do mean serious, no crack intended.And there I go again, being flippant, trying to raise a smile in one or two readers, even if it might resemble a risus sardonicus. (It’s how people on Sardinia used to grin, that’s why.)It’s a congenital condition – like my idiocy, claims my wife– that ever since I was young I made outrageous statements and people would say to me: \u0026#8216You can’t be serious.\u0026#8217 \u0026#8216Not on a regular basis, no,\u0026#8217 was my usual reply.For the greater part of my 70-odd years, while laughter was still an acceptable knee-jerk reaction to almost anything, I prospered, in a vaguely penniless way, as a freelance writer of would-be humorous journalism.Nothing too fancy, no slipping on banana skins, but not rocket science either.  (Although the rotation of the Earth really makes my day.)In retrospect, I see now that my humour wasn’t serious enough. It had no underlying message.  It had no sociological content.  It was not of the variety that allowed people to feel wise, nod wisely, and say something wise, like: \u0026#8216Very wise…\u0026#8217The mistakes of the past – of my past – included trying to make people lose control and laugh aloud, rather than just being able to smirk knowingly at my cleverness, if I ever was.We live in a much more buttoned-up, uptight and insecure society than we used to (do you feel my sociological message approaching?) and it has affected the sort of things we feel we are permitted to laugh at, or not permitted to laugh at.Scorn and ridicule can no longer be directed at certain people with impunity – the dishonourable exception being bankers and politicians, of course, who are still fair game, and rightly so, even if out on bail and technically innocent because they haven’t been charged yet.But when did you last hear a blitz of jokes from a television comedian about a small, ethnic, obese, female bishop, even if she was his mother-in-law?Don’t worry, the news isn’t all bad, and I can report that sometimes outbreaks of laughter can occur in the most unusual places – Dundee, for example – and at the most unexpected times.Not long ago I saw a funeral procession led by a slow-marching, black-suited chaplain who was laughing his head off as he walked along in front of the hearse.As I watched in amazement, his happy demeanour began to affect his slow progress, which became a sprightly strut, and it seemed at any moment he might twirl his top hat in his hands, or even produce a rabbit from it.Only when I caught sight of the wireless device attached to his ear did I guess he was probably listening to dance music on a radio earbud. Death is no respecter of parsons.Let’s hope the worst extremes of political correctness will gradually fade away, as common sense brings a return to humorous nonsense, and seriousness wilts in the face of jocularity.A life without laughter?You must be joking.David Aitken,Dundee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"flags fly as putting green opens","story":"There are 18 holes on the seaside green next to the children\u0026#8217s play park and staff also have three play tents, mats for younger children and a small selection of safe toys.South Kintyre Development Trust (SKDT) which manages the attraction has putters to suit all heights and a scorecard is provided.At the end of May SKDT was awarded £75,000 from the Big Lottery Fund (BLF).A BLF press release stated: \u0026#8216This funding will enable the organisation to not only continue but develop their activities at Campbeltown village hall.\u0026#8217At the opening were South Kintyre Development Trust\u0026#8217s Shaun Brown,  putting green staff Tina Chestnut and Peter Lusher with Morag McMillan. 25_c23puttinggreen01Baby Julia Skibinska, 11 months, was happy to play by the putting green. 25_c23puttinggreen02Cate McMillan, 11 months, chewed on some plastic ice cream. 25_c23puttinggreen03\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter mok run thankyou","story":"The continued outstanding success of Mok Run race weekend is a reflection of the ever-increasing dedication and commitment its hard working committee, community volunteers, local businesses, enthusiastic runners and crowd supporter’s display year after year.On behalf of myself and the Mok Run committee I would like to say a massive thank you to those who contributed their free time and energy to make this happen for the 13th consecutive year.Each year we are given tremendous support from many individuals and organisations listed here and this is very much appreciated.Sincere thanks to: Campbeltown Co-op, Wee Toon Sports , McFadyens, Mach Dunes, Tunnocks, AM Transport, Argyll Bakeries, Seafield Hotel, Campbeltown Pottery, Kintyre Agricultural Society,  Jim Martin Supplies, Killegruer Caravan Site, Machrihanish Holiday Park, Glen Scotia, Spring Bank, Beinn An Tuirc, Live Argyll,  Stewart Balfour and Sutherland, Campbeltown Running Club, Jogscotland and Wee Toon Warriors.By supporting this event, you have made a concrete contribution to the greater community.I would also like to extend my grateful thanks to: all the MOK Run committee members who work tirelessly behind the scenes our race marshals \u0026#8211 without whom this event would not happen race sweepers  race day commentator Councillor John Armour Gavin Reid Johnny Durnan David McMillan Willie Ralston Barrs Clochkeil Councillor Donald Kelly Argyll and Bute Council amenities team Campbeltown Police Office Southend Scouts Campbeltown\u0026#8217s: Young Fire Fighters Coastguard Sea Cadets Police Scotland Youth Volunteers massage therapists Brass Band Kintyre Schools Pipe Band West Coast EMT Jamie G  South Kintyre Sports Council \u0026#8211 for making our legendary post race ceilidh such a success Dalintober primary pupils for their motivational posters to our photographers: John McFadyen Campbeltown Courier\u0026#8217s Mark Davey Kenny Craig and Greg and Norma Grogan for capturing the spirit of the weekend Fiona and Donna Robertson and all the Junior MOK Run volunteers and to many of our other volunteers who took the time to help on race day.Apologies if I have missed anyone.A special thank you once again goes to the residents of Limecraigs, for taking the time to decorate the street, provide well received ‘showers’ along with the local fire brigade ‘shower’ who came out in full force to cheer the runners on in the final leg of the 10K route.As one runner summed it up on our facebook page: \u0026#8216Fantastic day !\u0026#8216Thanking all the organisers, marshals, water-givers, water-hosers, sweety-givers, pipers, drummers, sandwich and pastry makers, and everyone else involved.

Momentum has since picked-up.Last year 30 newcomers were trained to sail dinghies and a new stand-up paddle-boarding (SUP) group was formed local volunteers are now completing their training as SUP instructors.A first ever community regatta is planned for August 4 to open up participation in a range of marine sports.Two community organisations and three local sports clubs \u0026#8211 sailing, kayaking and diving \u0026#8211 have joined the SCIO as corporate members, with the approval of their national governing bodies.Others are likely to follow.\u0026#8216We didn’t start out to break new ground,\u0026#8217 added Mr Fox, \u0026#8216But the feedback we are getting suggests that our approach is both unusual and attractive to funders, because we have combined community- and sports groups in a single, inclusive organisation.\u0026#8216But we still have to make the case, and objective cost/benefit analysis of the options is essential. \u0026#8216The options appraisal will look at potential locations for the proposed new building, taking account of community interest as well as planning and technical issues.Jennifer Nicoll, Argyll and the Islands area manager for HIE, said: \u0026#8216Kintyre Seasports is an ambitious project involving a large scale redevelopment and therefore requires a full options appraisal of possible sites.\u0026#8216I am pleased we are able to support this early stage of the project and look forward to the findings of the appraisal.\u0026#8217Kintyre Seasports Project member and the Kintyre Canoe Club coach, Sid Gallagher, ran an well supported introduction to canoeing session last Saturday.Young canoeists trying out the sport are from left: Riley Suddes, 10, Sean West, 10, Flint-Phoenix Barrett, 10, Bradley Suddes, 12 and coach Sid Gallagher. 25_c23canoeing03Morag McLean and her grand-daughter Hollie McLean, 5, try canoeing. 25_c23canoeing02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"makeover resurrects st kierans hall","story":"The sale of Campbeltown\u0026#8217s Red Cross hall has spurred the refurbishment of St Kieran\u0026#8217s own premises next door.In common with many town charities, St Kieran\u0026#8217s had held its own church coffee mornings in the Red Cross hall which the national charity is attempting to sell.St Kieran\u0026#8217s hall, which has upstairs and downstairs rooms and a serviceable kitchen, was once the town\u0026#8217s Roman Catholic primary school but since closing had fallen into a state of disrepair.Pensioner Archie Wilson, who helped in the six week refurbishment, said: \u0026#8216I remember the classrooms  from those odd occasions when I went to school.\u0026#8217The church\u0026#8217s priest, Father Tony Wood said: \u0026#8216I am very grateful for all the work that has been done and how it has been completed.\u0026#8216The plaster was falling off the walls and the windows were black.

The minimum owners\u0026#8217 contribution for each unit was £5,000. After a lengthy period he sold all of his flats.\u0026#8216Council officers, due to their breadth of experience of historic building repair, have gone way beyond their nominal roles to help the association and stop the project falling to pieces.\u0026#8217HES approved the council’s CARS bid in January 2015.  During the next three years, the association came up with £101,000 between them.The association was awarded a CARS grant of £383,000, which included £306,000 from HES and a private sector housing grant £141,000 making a total project value of £625,000.A council spokesperson said: \u0026#8216CARS money was ring-fenced for the scheme but had to be committed by March 2018.\u0026#8217Shortly after the cash was guaranteed,  the association appointed  a firm of Glasgow conservation architects, ZM Architecture Ltd., to lead a consultation team to scope, survey and cost the scheme.The repair project has three parts: high level repairs including roofing, leadwork and rainwater goods, extensive stone repairs and the replacement of the rear walkways and failing amenity deck.A council spokesperson added: \u0026#8216Although the building is not covered by statutory listing it is considered of historical importance and occupies a key location in the town centre.\u0026#8217After 12 months of development work the works were put out to tender and five quotes were obtained.Glasgow conservation specialists John Fulton  (Plumbers) Ltd was appointed. The firm is expected to use a number of Kintyre sub-contractors.An incident in July 2015, when a teenager narrowly escaped death, illustrated the urgent need for repairs.The 12-year-old boy fell, about 20 feet into the shop below through the rotten decking skylight, while taking part in the latest craze \u0026#8211 free running \u0026#8211 popularised in films such as Casino Royale.For more on the regeneration of Campbeltown see an Argyll and Bute Council feature on pages 14 and 15.George McMillan looks into the hole in his roof in 2015. 25_c30roof01The timber rooflight structure, on the leaky deck, after the 2015 incident.  25_c30roof03Scaffolding is erected at 22 to 30 Main Street.  NO_c23cars10_scaffold_erectionLast week scaffolding was erected through the deck area.  NO_c23cars11_scaffold_through_deckThe full deck area.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

Rockers Altered Sky are fulfilling their ambition of playing at Download Festival, Britain\u0026rsquos premier hard rock and heavy metal festival, on Thursday, June 7, with plans for a UK summer tour also set to be announced in the coming weeks.  The band, which includes Haddington\u0026rsquos Ana Nowosielska and Amy Blair, will be the main support in the Doghouse Tent, with the gig taking place the day before the main festival gets under way.  Ana, the band\u0026rsquos lead singer, was excited \u0026ldquobeyond words ahead of the festival, which is celebrating its 16th year.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt is up there with a childhood dream.  \u0026ldquoYou would go to Download and see Slipknot and Metallica and we are going to be playing there as well.  \u0026ldquoIt is absolutely amazing.  The band is looking at hiring a van and staying for the four-day festival at Donington Park, which this year is headlined by Avenged Sevenfold, Guns N\u0026rsquo Roses and Ozzy Osbourne.

Currently the band\u0026rsquos attention is focused on creating their second album, the follow-up to Without Wonderland.  The five-piece will soon head down to Wales to record the album, with a view to it being released in the New Year.  Ana, 28, said: \u0026ldquoEverything has been a lot easier this time.  \u0026ldquoWe were joking the other day and saying we had a good five years to write the first album and now we have had six months to write the second album.  \u0026ldquoThe difference is we are definitely going to see that the album is going to stand by itself.  The band are then hoping to get back on the open road, with a UK tour being organised and the band keen to venture further afield again.  Last autumn, the band enjoyed a 19-date tour which saw them performing in the Philippines and Japan.  Ana told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are obviously talking about going back to Asia again. We met so many good people and made so many wonderful relationships.  \u0026ldquoWe would like to tour Europe \u0026ndash hit up Germany and we had an Italian tour in the works a year ago which fell through.  \u0026ldquoThen, of course, we would like to get over to the USA.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.

Between April 1 last year and the end of March 2018, 2,006 three-day emergency food supplies were given to local people.  Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.  In 2017-2018 benefit changes/delays accounted for 757 East Lothian cases with 1,666 people affected, including 617 children. In addition, 595 cases were referred for emergency food due to being refused a crisis grant, affecting 937 people, of which 253 were under the age of 16.  A total of 31,604 kilos of food was given out last year by the county\u0026rsquos foodbank, with 50,292kgs donated.  Peter Dicker, foodbank manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to provide vital support when it matters most \u0026ndash we\u0026rsquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community with no money for food are able to access emergency support, and that has only been possible in the last year because of the incredible generosity shown by local people in donating food, time and funds.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray condemned the figures, saying: \u0026ldquoThese shocking figures underline the fact that problems with changes to the benefits system have made a significant contribution to the rise in foodbank referrals.  \u0026ldquoGovernments at Holyrood and Westminster can no longer sit back and accept the ever increasing number of people being forced to use foodbanks.

As many as 1,600 homes \u0026ndash as well as business units, a supermarket, primary school and various green spaces \u0026ndash are planned for the former opencast mine site at Blindwells.  The first housebuilder is expected to be announced this summer, with work on housing getting under way potentially by the end of the year.  In the meantime, preparatory work has been carried out on the site, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie and Port Seton.  Now Hargreaves, which is behind the proposals, is looking to create an access to the site off the roundabout to the north of the A1 at Bankton Junction.  Iain Slater, development and estates director, said the new exit would be permanent, although it would initially be limited to construction traffic.  Other works are planned for the junction, which links the A1 with the A198.  Mr Slater said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the permission the road layout will be altered to allow for the additional cars generated from the Blindwells development.  \u0026ldquoThese works include widening of the A198 approaching the roundabout to increase capacity [as well as] the installation of a filter lane to allow cars leaving the A1 heading east to go round to Tranent without stopping at the roundabout. There are also plans for traffic lights to assist with traffic flows should the need arise.  As many as 350 jobs could be created during the lengthy building period at the site.  Construction work on the 1,600 homes could take 12-15 years, with early plans already drawn up for a second phase further to the east which could see another 1,600 homes, as well as leisure space and a cemetery."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7870497.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Tranent singer Caitlyn Vanbeck  39 s first single takes charts by storm","story":"              TRANENT singer Caitlyn Vanbeck\u0026rsquos first single flew up the charts when it was released on Monday.

The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.  Mr Beattie said: \"There is no doubt that there are issues around patients\u0026rsquo communication with the surgery, particularly at peak times. I was pleased that the surgery has recognised this and was in a position to give me a briefing on the situation.\"  He said doctors were now up to their full staffing level of 14 and an additional four staff members to take phone calls were in the process of being recruited.  During the visit, Mr Beattie had the chance to discuss other new initiatives which were \"positively transforming the surgery\".  He said: \"While much work seems to have been done, more still has to be achieved to improve the service to patients.  \"I am confident that Riverside and East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership are seriously addressing their remaining issues and I will be keeping in close contact going forward to ensure that my constituents receive the service they should expect.\"  He added that the practice was looking at introducing an online appointment booking system, which it is anticipated would reduce phone calls to the practice.  Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":null,"title":"Fund in memory of much-missed Jess Mackie helping others","story":"              A MEMORIAL fund set up following the tragic death of a caring 14-year-old girl is on target to reach \u0026pound10,000 raised.  Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.

In total, 24 fourth-year students from Musselburgh Grammar School received hands-on experience in team building, staging an event, kitchen and cooking essentials, and barista skills as part of an ongoing partnership with the school.  The students also heard presentations from Craig Bonnar of award-winning catering company and official racecourse supplier Heritage Portfolio Susan Manchester, general manager of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art cafes and Sarah Montgomery, the racecourse\u0026rsquos senior operations and commercial manager.  Three pupils were invited to return to the racecourse the following day to support an industry roadshow attended by senior executives in the British horseracing industry, racehorse owners and trainers and racecourse managers.  In previous years, racecourse staff have undertaken a number of volunteer activities to support local causes as part of the annual Give and Gain Day, including restoration work at Olivebank Children\u0026rsquos Centre and a beach clean at Fisherrow.

So what can fans expect to find in Russia and what is there to see and do in between the festival of football?  (pronounced Vulga-grat)  Volgograd, once known as Stalingrad until it was renamed in 1961, will play host to England\u0026rsquos opening game against Tunisia on June 18.  Around 621 miles south of Moscow, it is, according to the Fifa World Cup 2018 tourist site, a \u0026ldquosunny and hospitable city whose residents love fishing, football, boat rides and beaches.  And as the site of one of the most famous, and most bloody, battles in the Second World War, it is a symbol of Russian patriotic pride.  Official estimates put the victorious Red Army\u0026rsquos dead, wounded, missing or captured at around 1.1 million, while Axis casualties and prisoners are believed to have been more than 800,000 in the battle which lasted for several months from 1942-43.  The city, which had been an industrial city producing arms during the war, was almost destroyed in the fighting and was rebuilt from a single plan.  A huge monument, an 85-metre high statue of a woman wielding a sword called The Motherland Calls, stands as the centrepiece of a memorial park in the heart of a city that sprawls for 62 miles along the Volga river.  It also boasts the tallest statue of Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin in Russia, with the monument standing at 57 metres.  As for night-time entertainment, some England fans might feel comfortable in the knowledge there is an Irish chain pub, Harat\u0026rsquos, and three McDonald\u0026rsquos outlets.  The Fifa fan zone on the Armii Embankment of the Volga will show live games to those not attending the matches.  Average temperatures can hit as high at 27C in June.  (pronounced: Neezh-nee Nohv-guh-ruht)  With a population of more than one million people, Nizhny Novgorod, or Nizhny for short, is Russia\u0026rsquos fifth largest city.  During the Soviet era the city was off limits to foreign nationals between 1959 and 1990, when it was named Gorky after Russian writer Maxim Gorky. Nizhny has retained much of its traditional architecture.  Sights include the city\u0026rsquos Kremlin, a medieval fortress, the 560-step Chkalov staircase leading from the centre to the bank of the Volga river and the Strelka \u0026ndash where the River Oka flows into the Vogla.  The dedicated fan zone showing live games will be set up Minin and Pozharsky Square, next to the Kremlin.  Again, homesick England fans can find three McDonald\u0026rsquos to eat in, as well as the self-explanatory Union Jack Grand Music Pub and a restaurant called the English Embassy.  For those wanting to dip a toe in the Volga of Russian cuisine, the World Cup tourist site recommends Beryozka, a bar that also specialises in long drinks.  There is also an 1950s American-themed cocktail bar called Franky nearby.  England will play Panama in the newly-built Nizhny Novgorod Stadium on June 24.  (pronounced: Kah-lee-neen-grahd)  Kaliningrad is a province of Russia which is cut off from the rest of the country and sandwiched in between Lithuania and Poland on the Baltic coast.  The area was once part of the German region of East Prussia until the Allied powers transferred it to the Soviet Union after the Second World War.  The port city and provincial capital which bears the same name was formerly known as Konigsberg and dates back to 1255, when a grand master of the Teutonic Knights, a Catholic military order, established a castle there.  Konigsberg was heavily bombed by the Allies in 1944 and invaded by the Soviets in 1945 but some of the old city\u0026rsquos districts and buildings remain, including the lion and bear enclosures at Kaliningrad Zoo, according to the Fifa city guide.  The remnants of the Soviet era remain, though, with a prime example being an imposing 70s office block called the House of Soviets, which was intended to house the regional Communist Party HQ but now stands empty.  Fans not going into the stadium will not be able to miss the monolith, which is next to the city\u0026rsquos Fifa fan zone in Tsentralnaya Square.  England fans attending the final group match against Belgium on June 28 may be more interested to know the Fifa city guide points to a number of bars and restaurants in among the shopping malls along Mira and Leninsky avenues, including a pub called London which occupies the former Consulate General of the USSR and a chain pub named Britannica.  England fans searching for signs that they have left the country can instead try several German-style brewhouses and Russian restaurants in the city centre.  (pronounced Repino)  Gareth Southgate\u0026rsquos men will set up camp in Repino, a resort village around 28 miles from St Petersburg city centre that sits on the banks of the Gulf of Finland.  As cold as it sounds, the players, the press corps and any fans deciding to join them can expect average temperatures of between 15C and 17C in June and July respectively.  And there are beaches.  The England players and staff will be able to enjoy the four-star trappings of the ForRestMix Country Club hotel, which boasts a spa, 25-metre swimming pool and 450 square metres of gyms and playing courts.  The rest of the unofficial entourage will have to make do with the half-a-dozen other cheaper hotels listed on TripAdvisor in the area, at least one of which has its own nightclub, while there is a tree-top rope park to tangle with."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7662931.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Meat traces    found in vegan and vegetarian ready meals   ","story":"              The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has said it is investigating allegations that traces of meat were found in vegetarian and vegan ready meals.

Andrew Yorkston parked his vehicle in a lay-by near to Drummohr Holiday Park and left the two youngsters in the back seat of the locked car for about 30 minutes on a hot summer\u0027s day.  The six-year-old girl and two-year-old boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl banging on the car windows and screaming: \u0026ldquoHelp, save us.  The worried passers-by contacted the police and waited by the car to calm the kids before Yorkston eventually appeared, claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been [away] five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 27-year-old then drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  On Tuesday, Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard that Yorkston was in charge of the children when he was taking them to a nearby McDonald\u0027s and stopped off unexpectedly at the lay-by near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane told the court that the two-year-old boy and the six-year-old girl were spotted locked in the car at about 5.30pm.  Mr Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who were very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe six-year-old was shouting: \u0026lsquoHelp, save us.\u0026rsquo  The girl pointed to an opening in the trees and told the passers-by that the man looking after her was down there, the court heard.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, said that Yorkston, of North Grange Avenue, had stopped for a toilet break and his wife had been left \u0026ldquosuitably unimpressed by his actions.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  The solicitor added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0027s and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme.  \u0026ldquoFortunately there was no harm down to the children.  Sheriff Adrian Cottam deferred sentence to next month.

The annual list used readings taken from 2013 and named Prestonpans as the worst offender in Scotland.  WHO released a similar report two years ago which also named and shamed Prestonpans \u0026ndash yet it was thought then that the reported high pollution levels in the town related to the former Cockenzie Power Station, which had been operational until March 2013.  However, East Lothian Council told the Courier earlier this month that it believed the reading was actually down to a geographical error by WHO, claiming that the organisation had confused Prestonpans with Preston in Lancashire, nearly 200 miles away.  And this week, the WHO confirmed that this was indeed the case.  In an email to senior environmental health officials at the local authority, representatives of WHO confirmed that they had confused the two communities due to a computer mapping error.

A poll of deputy heads and principal teachers found nearly two thirds either \u0026ldquodisagreed or \u0026ldquostrongly disagreed when asked whether they wanted to become a headteacher - up from some 50 per cent last year.  The Association of Headteachers and Deputes in Scotland (AHDS), which conducted the survey, said the findings highlighted a \u0026ldquosignificant leaning towards uncertainty about seeking headship roles.  The same survey went on to highlight the main concerns of headteachers as being workload, bureaucracy and lack of teaching and support staff.  On average headteachers said they were working more than 55 hours a week - twenty more hours than they are contracted for.  Read more: Schools struggle to recruit headteachers  Members of the union who submitted written responses identified a range of concerns with one stating: \u0026ldquoI have the headship qualification, but do not want the stress of headship.  Another said: \u0026ldquoI cannot see how I could become a headteacher without it being detrimental to my own family life.  One headteacher who had been in the post for a decade said they had stepped down due to family circumstances citing a lack of work life balance.  The survey comes as the Scottish Government prepares to give more powers to headteachers under a new Education Bill.  Read more: Rushing Headteachers\u0027 Charter could be \u0027disastrous\u0027  The legislation will usher in a new Headteachers\u0026rsquo Charter which will enable heads to shape the curriculum, decide on how funding is allocated and select staff.  The rationale is a concern that decision-making by councils can be divorced from what is required at school level.  However, critics argue the proposals will increase school bureaucracy and make headteachers a lightening rod for any criticisms and concerns about standards making the job even more stressful.  Greg Dempster, general secretary of the AHDS, said international research proved how important high quality school leadership was.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhat our survey tells us very clearly is that, due to a lack of resources or an excess of expectations, our school leaders are finding themselves diverted into front line roles or back-room bureaucracy.  \u0026ldquoThat prevents them from getting to the core of the leadership role of engaging with pupils, parents and staff in pursuit of school improvement.  \u0026ldquoThe current situation is putting many high quality candidates off headship, so the already poor recruitment position continues to worsen.  Mr Dempster said there were obvious implications for the introduction of the Headteachers\u0026rsquo Charter.  He added: \u0026ldquoSchool leaders are clearly struggling to deliver in their current roles and the government must take that reality seriously when considering how to progress and resource changes to the roles and responsibilities of school leaders.

Every high-backed chair is precisely lacquered, each window handle and umbrella stand a work of art in itself. On the tables, cucumber sandwiches, crisp white napkins and Willow-patterned cups and saucers hark back to a more elegant age. Welcome to afternoon tea Charles Rennie Mackintosh style.  Yesterday was the Glasgow-born artist\u0026rsquos 150th birthday and it marked a double celebration as guests including the city\u0026rsquos Lord Provost Eva Bolander were given a sneak preview of the stunning restoration and recreation of one of his greatest works.  Four years after an ambitious plan was created to bring the original Willow Tea Rooms Building in Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow, back to its former glory, the scale and success of the project was revealed. Hundreds of craftspeople from as far afield as Chicago, Hong Kong, Cumbria and Kirkcaldy have worked to meticulously restore and recreate Mackintosh\u0026rsquos original vision. And it is magnificent.  Mackintosh at the Willow as it will be known (the Willow Tea Rooms name is owned by Anne Mulhern, who runs another cafe just yards away) won\u0026rsquot open to the public till 02 July. But it is worth the wait.  As well as a 200-seat tearoom and restaurant, a place to discover and rediscover the work of Mackintosh, there will be a visitor\u0026rsquos centre as well as exhibition, retail, conference and education space, creating a cultural and community hub. Elements of the site will open throughout the summer.  The Willow Tea Room Trust, which conceived and co-ordinated the \u0026pound10m renovation, hopes to welcome at least 360,000 visitors a year, providing a boost to tourism in a part of the city centre that has declined in recent years, not least after the recent fire on Sauchiehall Street.  Conceived as a a social enterprise, it already provides training and work for 40 staff, many of them young people involved in the Princes Trust charity. The Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society will also have a base at the site.  The original Willow Tea Rooms, opened in October 1903, was one of a series commissioned by Glasgow entrepreneur Miss Catherine Cranston, and the only one created by Mackintosh \u0026ndash her partner in design - in its entirety, from the architecture of the building to the furniture and cutlery. It also featured stunning panels by Mackintosh\u0026rsquos wife, the designer Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh and is recognised as one of the finest complete Art Nouveau schemes in the world.  The expert team behind the renovation project worked mainly from black and white photographs contained in an art periodical to get every aspect of the interior detail right. And the woman behind the transformation is delighted with the result.  \u0026ldquoThis is such a happy day, said Celia Sinclair, chair of the Trust. \u0026ldquoThis is a landmark heritage restoration and re-creation that is all about engaging the next generation of artists, designers and entrepreneurs. It\u0026rsquos also about instilling civic pride in Glasgow folk.  \u0026ldquoI hope Mackintosh and Miss Cranston would be pleased by what we have done, and I rather suspect they would love what we are trying to achieve.  \u0026ldquoMackintosh was neglected by his fellow Scots during his own time and I was amazed by the lack of interest when I originally approached various organisations over this project. But four years on this is an exciting new beginning. Toshie, your day has come.  Pamela Robertson, Professor Emerita of Mackintosh Studies at the University of Glasgow, a member of the expert panel who oversaw the renovation, described the day as a \u0026ldquomilestone in the history of the building.  She added: \u0026ldquoThis was a journey of discovery for all of us. The Willow was undoubtedly Mackintosh\u0026rsquos finest commission for Miss Cranston and has been extremely challenging for us to reinstate. But the analysis of the photographs has allowed us to re-engage with the textures and forms of this stunning design, to really see what Mackintosh envisioned."},{"url":null,"title":"SNP support on increase  poll finds","story":"              Support for the SNP has increased to 40% and could see the party pick up another eight seats at Westminster, according to a new poll.  The YouGov survey for The Times Scotland found the Scottish Conservatives have retaken second place on 27% - up 4% from the last poll - while Labour have dropped 5% to 23% in Westminster voting intentions.  Despite the SNP and Tories both growing in support by 4% since January, a seat projection from the poll gave the SNP 43 MPs - up from the current 35 - but saw the Tories drop two seats to 11.  Labour would lose six seats and be left with just one MP, according to the poll of more than 1,000 Scots carried out at the start of June.  However, a similar seat projection on the proportional system Scottish Parliament would see the SNP lose nine seats despite an increase in voting intentions for the party.  The projection would see the Greens pick up three seats and Labour, Lib Dems and Tories pick up two each.  Deputy First Minister John Swinney said: \"This is an extraordinary endorsement of our record in government, with people continuing to put their trust in the SNP to deliver for Scotland.  \"But it also shows that we\u0027re winning the argument over Scotland\u0027s future - how best we keep driving our country forward, delivering the best public services anywhere in the UK and building a fairer country.  \"Our vision to create a successful economy and flourishing, inclusive society could not be further at odds with despair and chaos of Brexit from the Tories.  \"But these figures will make dismal reading for Labour.

Ruth Davidson was the only senior politician with a postive rating at 11. Theresa May scored lowest at -44 with Nicola Sturgeon on -2.

Or rather, bubbles within bubbles. A small pocket of members of a club which is itself a fraction of society at large. But like all bubbles, they\u0026rsquore still liable to go pop.  The SNP conference in Aberdeen this weekend isn\u0026rsquot especially susceptible to this phenomenon. But some in the leadership seem to have forgotten it still applies to them. The cause of the cocky attitude, ironically, is what has been promoted as a healthy injection of realism.  It\u0026rsquos not the fault of the Sustainable Growth Commission chaired by former MSP and current corporate lobbyist Andrew Wilson. Its 354-page report was intended to sketch out a blueprint for independence and stimulate discussion, and it has achieved both.  The problem is that, having taken 20 months to arrive, it has assumed a semi-mythic status. It is unhelpful to be seen as the answer to many prayers. But it comes with no guarantee of salvation, and those who regard it as the game changer the independence movement has been waiting for should take a deep breath. It offers as many problems as solutions.  Nevertheless, Nicola Sturgeon and her ministers have welcomed it enthusiastically. The general impression they give is that the report is a turning point for the cause. Not a new beginning, as much is familiar, but certainly a more appealing modernisation.  It is has infuriated many on the left of the Yes movement, but Ms Sturgeon is coping well with their agony, reasonably assuming they will vote Yes again when it comes to the crunch. The report is there to reassure and cajole the 55 per cent, not thank the 45 per cent. Indeed, one of the first things Keith Brown said when he was elected the new SNP depute leader yesterday was that he wanted to debate the report beyond the party walls, reaching out to business groups and civic Scotland. The SNP\u0026rsquos boardroom charm offensive, run in the old days of devolution by John Swinney and Jim Mather, is evidently undergoing a revival.  But I suspect the SNP leadership is falling prey to its own hype. It has assumed the report will be readily accepted in the party \u0026ndash Ms Sturgeon has predicted a \u0026ldquovery positive reception \u0026ndash and, equally prematurely, assumed it will go down pretty well in the country at large.  Even in the inner bubble of conference, there were some clues that\u0026rsquos not so. One of the busiest fringe events on the first day in Aberdeen was a meeting to discuss the economics of independence. There were some interesting contributions from MSP Joan McAlpine and MP Kirsty Blackman. Ms McAlpine reflected that the party\u0026rsquos past advocacy of corporation tax cuts needed more subtly, while Ms Blackman talked about aping the Do it for Denmark campaign to grow the population, coyly suggesting \"Shag for Scotland\".  But the panel member getting the loudest applause was the one with the toughest criticisms of the Growth Commission. Former MP George Kerevan said the \u0026ldquoconservative plan to keep the pound would leave a newly independent Scotland \u0026ldquoat the mercy of the banks, while tight public spending to cut the deficit risked independence offering nothing for the poor. The audience looked a fairly typical slice of the SNP. There was a lot of grey hair and earnestness. Yet a great many appeared to share Mr Kerevan\u0026rsquos concerns.  But the starkest reminder that turning out a report is not the same as turning a corner came when Ms Sturgeon was interviewed by Channel 4 News. It was not her finest hour. Despite being at the apex of the Yes movement, she was unable to say how much it would cost to set up an independent state. This is no small detail. After trying to dance around the question, she finally admitted she couldn\u0026rsquot remember the figure in the Growth Commission report.  It resurrected all those memories of the 2014 referendum, when the Yes side was peppered with questions about the bill for leaving the UK. The Commission\u0026rsquos number \u0026ndash a bargain \u0026pound450m over five years \u0026ndash also echoed the naive optimism of many of the figures put around four years ago. As the Channel 4 journalist pointed out, it\u0026rsquos costing Scots taxpayers \u0026pound200m to set up a part-devolved social security system. So \u0026pound450m for a new country?  Amid a choking raft of poor statistics in education and health, and with the grassroots Yes movement agitating for a swift referendum, it is understandable that the SNP leadership is trying to shift the focus on to independence through the Growth Commission.  But, as Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos interview showed, it is dangerous to use the report as a campaign tool without the discipline of a campaign to back it up. Talking about independence as if her autumn decision on a referendum is already made simply invites questions of the kind that kept the Yes campaign on the back foot in 2014. The SNP is running ahead of itself. The Growth Commission is only one bubble in the national tide required to secure its goal."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/1004268.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Every Harry Potter film to be screened outdoors in Glencoe drive-in marathon","story":"              EVERY Harry Potter film is to be screened outside at one of the key locations of the famous film series.

Perhaps we have become de-sensitised to the slew of research and numbers that assault us several times a year each revealing a segment of deprivation.  One month it will be the numbers of people using foodbanks in another it will be the number of children living in poverty in yet another it will be mortality rates in our most disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Perhaps, too, we have become so impervious to the callousness of assorted Tory responses to these human catastrophes that we simply switch off. Not this time though. There was something chilling about this one.  The report, Destitution in the UK 2018, was produced by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and identified the number of people who were pushed into destitution during 2017 while looking at causes, solutions and context in the UK. Its top line revealed that one and a half million people were destitute last year, including 365,000 children. The UK Government\u0026rsquos response was this: \u0026ldquoThe Government believes that work is the best way out of poverty.  This time it seemed they had simply given up pretending to be concerned that any attempt at displaying humanity in the face of evil was pointless. Previously there would have been a pledge to do more or a vow to meet with agencies in the field and perhaps even a half-hearted nod to some money they had invested in a skills redevelopment scheme in Camden. Now it was just a shrug as if to say: \u0026ldquoSo, what do you expect us to do about it?  It carried echoes of 1834 when the Poor Law was introduced as a response to growing resentment among the ruling classes that the indolent poor were getting too many handouts. Workhouses would instead be introduced and these would soon sort out the wheat from the chaff. So inhumane were the conditions inside these places that it was felt workshy loafers everywhere would be forced to find meaningful employment. This single scrap of legislation spurred Charles Dickens into a frenzy of creativity that produced works such as Oliver Twist and Little Dorrit.  In 21st century Britain we can easily process words and phrases such as unemployment or inequality or the poverty gap but \"destitution\" seems to belong to another era. In the time of Dickens when squalor and infant death and poverty-related disease constantly stalked the existences of society\u0026rsquos most wretched people destitution was a familiar term it was all of the above and seemed to signify a state of utter hopelessness. It is not a word you would commonly expect to find in 21st century Britain, one of the richest and best-educated nations on earth and one that last year spent more than \u0026pound2bn maintaining Trident.  In its report the Joseph Rowntree Foundation describes destitution as being unable to afford the bare essentials that we all need to eat, stay warm and dry, and keep clean. \u0026ldquoPeople experiencing long-term poverty, it points out \u0026ldquowere typically tipped into destitution by harsh debt recovery practices (mainly by public authorities and utilities companies) benefit delays, gaps and sanctions financial and other pressures associated with poor health and disability high costs of housing, fuel and other essentials and, for some migrants, extremely low levels of benefits or no eligibility for benefits at all. It\u0026rsquos reasonable to suggest that Dickens might have expected most of these evils to have disappeared in the course of two centuries, not least because two years earlier the Great Reform Act had set the UK on a long course towards universal suffrage.  The figure of 1.5m destitute is down from 1.7m two years previously but if you think the numbers are heading in the right direction think again: the consequences of Universal Credit have yet to be measured. As we have seen, the Tory response to this was essentially: \u0026ldquoGet a job. This ignores the reality of unpaid carers being forced to give up work to care for sick relatives. It also fails to take account of the numbers of households suffering from the effects of in-work poverty. Last year research conducted by Cardiff University found that a record 60% of people in poverty live in a household where someone is in work. Families in the woefully under-regulated private rental sector were deemed most at risk. The refusal of the great majority of firms to pay the Living Wage is also a contributory factor after two decades where real wages have constantly lagged behind inflation.  Underlying the callousness of the Hard Right towards the poor is the view that benefits are handouts, free money that it pains them to disburse. They are nothing of the sort. Benefits have mainly been bought and paid for by those who receive them when they were in work or by previous generations of their families. They have been earned. In contrast, the UK loses billions each year because the hardest work ever undertaken by rich Tory donors is in finding ways to avoid paying taxes.  The Rowntree report came at the end of a week in which the taxpayer took a \u0026pound2bn hit with the sell-off of part of the Royal Bank of Scotland. When the sell-off is complete we will have lost close to the \u0026pound27bn we were assured we would gain by taking control of RBS. This was Alistair Darling\u0026rsquos great \u0026lsquotriumph\u0026rsquo. His former boss Gordon Brown was also wheeled out this week, channelling his inner Nigel Farage by railing against the migrants as he reprised his desperate British jobs for British workers theme from 2007.  In this exchange in Dickens\u0026rsquo Christmas Carol, published in 1843, Ebenezer Scrooge encounters a group of charity collectors in the company of the Spirit of Christmas Present.  Ebenezer: But have they no refuge, no resource?  Spirit of Christmas Present: [quoting Scrooge] Are there no prisons? Are there no workhouses?  First Collector: At this festive time of year, Mr. Scrooge, it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the poor and destitute.  Not long ago we would have dismissed the notion of food banks let alone mass destitution in 21st century Britain. How long before an enterprising Tory proposes a return of the Poor Law, secure in the knowledge that food banks and destitution flourish and no one lifts a finger in protest?"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7899748.jpg?type=article-full","title":"King Kenny becomes a knight as more than 100 Scots get Queen s Birthday honours","story":"              He thought it was a demand from the taxman.  But the letter that arrived for Scotland\u0027s most-capped footballer Kenny Dalglish was in fact an invitation to hear the words: \"Arise Sir Kenny\".  Kenny Dalglish leads the Scots honoured in the Queen\u0026rsquos Birthday Honours list after being knighted for his role in helping the families of the Hillsborough disaster.    The football legend dedicated his knighthood to his family and everyone involved in his career after admitting it \u0026ldquodoesn\u0026rsquot feel right receiving the personal accolade.  The former player, manager and tireless charity campaigner joined more than 100 \"exceptional\" Scots from fields including science, sport, education and business have been recognised in the Queen\u0027s Birthday Honours List.  University of Glasgow graduate Professor James Hough, who helped detect gravitational waves, is among those to be given knighthoods along with Glasgow-born book shop founder Tim Waterstone.    There was an OBE for Scots horse trainer Lucinda Russell, who trained the 2017 Grand National winner One for Arthur and Aberdonian oil industry tycoon Sir Ian Wood, who was given a knighthood in 1994, added to his honours by being made chancellor of the Order of the Thistle by the Queen.  Sir Craig Reedie, president of the World Anti-Doping Agency, receives a Knight Grand Cross for services to sport while Glasgow banker Douglas Flint is knighted for services to the finance industry.    And a lifeboat volunteer involved in 634 rescues has been honoured with an MBE along with long-serving emergency service workers. Bill Deans, 68, started volunteering with Aberdeen\u0027s Inshore Lifeboat team in 1976 when he was working as a police officer.  Sir Kenny who was manager at Anfield at the time of the disaster when 96 Liverpool fans were crushed to death at an FA Cup semi-final on 15 April 1989, said he was \"hugely proud to have accepted the accolade\" for services to football, charity and the City of Liverpool.  The 67-year-old former Celtic star and his wife Marina have also helped raise millions of pounds for cancer treatment through the Marina Dalglish Appeal after she successfully battled breast cancer. and his wife Marina have also helped raise millions of pounds for cancer treatment through the Marina Dalglish Appeal after she successfully battled breast cancer.    Joking that he thought the letter informing him of the knighthood had been from the taxman, he added of the achievement: \"We only set out to do the best we possibly could, even through all the other stuff - the charity or Hillsborough, it was to help people because somebody helped us.\"  He added: \"Obviously it takes everything you have done in your life into consideration.  \"Football was part of it and a very important part of it. So is the charity that we have in Marina\u0027s name and obviously Hillsborough must have been part of it as well.  \"Someone in their wisdom has thought it was deserving of some recognition. I am hugely proud to have accepted the accolade.    \"You start off in your life just hoping to be a footballer. You become a footballer and have a bit of success and that seems to give you a platform to go on to other things.  \"We only set out to do the best we possibly could, even through all the other stuff.  \"The charity or Hillsborough it was to help people because somebody helped us.\"  Relatives of Liverpool fans who died in the Hillsborough disaster called for the former Liverpool manager to be knighted for his \"extraordinary\" response to the tragic events seven years ago.  Former Lord Mayor of Liverpool Steve Rotherham MP told fans at an Anfield memorial service in 2011 that the families had asked him to table an Early Day Motion to make the request.    He helped ensure the club was represented at all of the fans\u0027 funerals and attended many of them in person.  Mr Rotherham, who is now  Mayor for the Liverpool City Region, said at the time: \"People are commemorated for their services to national sport, Sir Bobby Robson for instance, charitable causes, and Kenny and Marina [his wife)] have had a very successful charity \u0026ndash the Marina Dalglish Breast Cancer Appeal \u0026ndash which has opened a new radiotherapy centre in Fazakerley hospital. Then there is the support he has given to the families \u0026ndash and therefore the community \u0026ndash from day one. So he has done all three.  \"It would definitely be of benefit to the Hillsborough families. While it is recognition for Kenny Dalglish himself, the families are quite clear that any individual award to him would reflect on the 96 as well and the work he has done on their behalf.  \"It nearly broke him. He and Marina went to five funerals in one day. Whilst they were counselling people there might, in hindsight, perhaps have been someone to counsel Kenny and Marina and that didn\u0027t happen.\"    In talking about the award Dalglish, made an MBE in 1984 for services to football, used \u0027we\u0027 throughout - specifically referring to himself and his wife but also the wider family.  His team won the highly-emotional all-Merseyside final in the year of Hillsborough - a day Dalglish identifies as the stand-out moment of his career.  \"For me, that is the most important memory,\" he said.  \"Not because of the game itself but because of what it meant to the people of Liverpool.  \"All right, we lost the league to Arsenal but I think the cup was the most important trophy that year for everybody - and that\u0027s not to undervalue anything else.  \"I look back and think \u0027I\u0027m really pleased we won that one\u0027.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Sturgeon left floundering after forgetting cost of independence during interview","story":"              NICOLA Sturgeon was left floundering after appearing to forget how much setting up an independent Scotland would cost \u0026ndash just two weeks after her own report placed the figure at \u0026pound450 million.  The First Minister repeatedly failed to answer when quizzed during a television interview on the first day of the SNP\u0027s conference in Aberdeen.\u0026nbsp  After being asked about the issue six times, she eventually conceded: \"I can\u0027t recall the exact figure in the report.\"  It comes as Ms Sturgeon will today contrast the \u0026ldquoshambolic Conservative government with the SNP\u0027s record in Scotland.\u0026nbsp  She will argue the Tories\u0027 hostile migration policy is having a disastrous impact on public services and the economy \u0026ndash and ramp up calls for powers over migration to be devolved to Holyrood.  Addressing delegates, she is expected to say: \u0026ldquoScotland is a welcoming country \u0026ndash our prosperity and our public services depend on it.  \u0026ldquoIf Westminster cannot or will not act in our best interests, it is time that our own parliament was able to do so. It\u0026rsquos time for powers over migration to come to Scotland.\u0026nbsp  The SNP\u0027s Growth Commission report, which was launched at the end of last month, said the total set-up costs to establish government departments and agencies after independence would be \"around \u0026pound450 million over five years\".\u0026nbsp  It cited analysis by Professor Patrick Dunleavy of the London School of Economics, and argued most of these costs would be associated with establishing four new bodies \u0026ndash a defence force, a foreign affairs and trade department, a security agency and a central bank and regulator.  But in an interview with Channel 4 News, Ms Sturgeon was repeatedly unable to remember this figure, insisting: \"We haven\u0027t gone through the process of analysing the report and coming to a recommendation\".\u0026nbsp  Despite this, she argued it was \"realistic\". The First Minister was also unable to recall the \u0026pound200m cost of setting up a Scottish social security agency.  She told Channel 4\u0027s reporter: \"I don\u0027t have all of those figures right at the tip of my fingers right now.\"  A Scottish Conservative spokesman branded the interview an \"embarrassment\".\u0026nbsp  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is where the SNP\u0027s broken case for independence lies: with Nicola Sturgeon unable to remember fantasy figures for set up costs from a report she still insists is credible. What an embarrassment.  \"No wonder pro-independence supporters as well as pro-Union backers are running a mile from her independence blueprint. Everyone can see it doesn\u0027t add up.  Scottish Labour\u0027s deputy leader Lesley Laird accused Ms Sturgeon of being \"unable to answer even the simplest of questions on her report\".\u0026nbsp  The First Minister will use her speech at the SNP conference today to announce that the flagship \u0026pound150m Building Scotland Fund \u0026ndash the precursor to the Scottish National Investment Bank which was unveiled as part of this year\u0026rsquos budget \u0026ndash is \u0026ldquoopen for business.  She will reveal \u0026pound70m is to be invested in the coming year, including \u0026pound25m to support at least 3000 new homes.\u0026nbsp  Ms Sturgeon will say: \u0026ldquoSetting up a Scottish National Investment Bank is one of the most important steps that the Scottish Government is taking \u0026ndash it has the potential to put Scotland at the forefront of technological and environmental innovation and create jobs.  \u0026ldquoOf course, it will take a couple of years to get the bank up and running - so to bridge the gap, we have announced \u0026pound150m over the next two years for a new Building Scotland Fund.  \u0026ldquoI can announce today that this Fund is now open for business.\""},{"url":null,"title":"The Scots that were the winners in the Queen s Birthday Honours","story":"              The Scots in the Queen\u0027s Birthday Honours List.

The mum of two became the figurehead of a grassroots pressure group which successfully mobilised to save disused football pitches and tennis courts in Maryhill from being developed into flats.  Yet this week, a creative team from the National Theatre of Scotland have constructed a complex structure on the three acre site off Queen Margaret Drive in the city\u0026rsquos west end.  And Emily couldn\u0026rsquot be happier.  \u0026ldquoIt feels like we have come full circle now, she said. \u0026ldquoPeople are celebrating the space and even the council are being nice to us.  For nine years, Emily was a driving force in a dynamic community movement which sought to ensure the overgrown courts and pitches were preserved as an urban wild space.  The playfields were established in the 1930s, eventually falling out of use 60 years later. Slowly reclaimed by nature, they were gradually adopted by the community around Maryhill and North Kelvinside as an ad-hoc woodland surrounded by tenements.  Community connection grew as red blaise gave way to nature, with harvest festivals, bonfires, outdoor cinema, reindeer visits, Halloween light shows and choir performances taking place on the site. Bats, orchids and butterflies pointed to a rich ecosystem, and children enjoyed a natural play environment.  But in 2012 the land came under the scope of builders New City Vision in response to a 2009 council consultation process on the plot\u0026rsquos future.  Locals mounted a robust resistance which eventually saw the case called in by the Scottish Government for investigation.  In late 2016, the Scottish Reporter found in favour of the meadow ruling that no building was permitted on the site.  Until now. This week, setmakers from the National Theatre of Scotland have assembled a rangey structure for a new production based on a book written by an autistic Japanese teenager.  The Reason I Jump has been adapted from the book of the same name, and will be performed by a cast of actors with autism for two weeks from next Monday.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoI couldn\u0026rsquot imagine this happening back then. I knew this place was important for people, and that some parents brought their children here because it was the only place some autistic children would come and play because it was wild, and not structured.  \u0026ldquoWe always hoped that people would use the space in more creative ways. But the idea that the National Theatre of Scotland would be here would have been radical.  Since winning their David v Goliath tussle, the North Kelvin Meadow and Children\u0026rsquos Wood has established regular groups including a Five Ways To Wellbeing project for people with mental ill-health, as well as facilitating forest skills classes for schools and nurseries.  Five part time members of staff are in place, and locals youths have been engaged to take care of plants.  But the current synergy of natural and creative expression is the most precise representation of the vision campaigners had for the land.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoThe message in this play is highlighting something really important for people in every community, that restrictions on opportunities to be outside and play outside impact on mental health, and that includes people with autism.  For director Graham Eatough, the Meadow was the obvious choice once the project began its two-year development at NTS.  He said: \u0026ldquoOne of the main themes in the book is about Naoki\u0026rsquos powerful relationship with nature. In a world he finds difficult to interact with, the natural environment is affirming for him.  \u0026ldquoAs we were working with autistic actors, we realised they also felt nature was a place of respite, rejuvenation and positivity. So we decided to set the show outdoors, and started working with the people here.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a brilliant coming together with a place which already had that philosophy for a theatre show which is telling people a story about that relationship with nature.  The cast of children and adults are all on the autistic spectrum, with pupils from Glasgow\u0026rsquos Abercorn School, the Isobel Mair School in Renfrewshire, and Edinburgh\u0026rsquos St Crispin\u0026rsquos. Like the author of the book, some of the performers are non-verbal.  The set comprises a wooden maze and a central labyrinth built from old cobblestones reclaimed from a Maryhill street. The maze will be dismantled, but the labyrinth will become a permanent part of the wood.  Actor Nicky Tuxworth, 28, from West Calder, has Asperger\u0026rsquos. A gold medal winner in judo and bowls at the special olympics, she is incorporating elements of her sporting background into her performance.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos humbling for us to take parts of Naoki\u0026rsquos book and add our own individual experiences. I love working outside, rather than being confined to a darkened stage because it brings out a lot more skills. It\u0026rsquos such a release to be around nature. It makes you feel really connected.  \u0026ldquoAnd as well as the audience getting that from it, I hope they get a better understanding of the different types of autism, and special needs, that some people have. We hope this opens more eyes and hearts to the idea that being different isn\u0026rsquot a bad thing.  Emily added: \u0026ldquoSome people thought it was all about the campaign. But we can do so much more. It was always about alternative ways of thinking for a community."},{"url":null,"title":"Close all the schools if you want 10  pay rise  EIS members told","story":"              TEACHERS have been told they can secure a pay rise of more than 10 per cent if they \u0026ldquoclose every school in Scotland as part of a campaign of strike action.  The Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) teaching union is demanding the 10 per cent rise after a decade of salary erosion.  Members have repeatedly threatened strike action and the union intends to intensify the campaign following the summer holidays.  Helen Connor, convener of the EIS salaries committee, told the union\u0026rsquos annual general meeting in Dundee that concerted action across Scotland could see members securing an even higher pay-out.  But she also warned members they may have to consider an offer that was lower than 10 per cent.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need to be realistic. I am absolutely committed to the 10 per cent pay claim, but this is a negotiation and sometimes negotiations take you down a different road in terms of numbers.  \u0026ldquoIf you are offered eight per cent what are you going to do? We have a responsibility that if we are offered something we have to consult with members.  \u0026ldquoIf we can close every school in Scotland in October or November of this year then we would get well beyond ten per cent, but we need to make sure we engage the membership in whatever deal we are offered.  Desmond Kenny, from the EIS ruling council, said: \u0026ldquoWe deserve at least 20 per cent to 24 per cent. The money has been stolen from us over the past ten years.  Michael Dolan, a member of the EIS salaries committee, said the union would continue to negotiate in good faith, but a ballot on industrial action was \u0026ldquoalmost inevitable.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is strike action that keeps management awake at night and focuses their mind on a solution and it is strike action that will win this campaign.  \u0026ldquoIt is our experience that a day of action causes discomfort, but they get over that and for that reason we must embark on a well designed plan of action beyond one day.  Earlier, Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS, used his address to the AGM to call on members to back strikes if needed saying they were \u0026ldquoin it to win it.  Earlier this year, teachers rejected an offer of up to three per cent, which is in line with the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos public pay policy.  Mr Flanagan said 10 per cent was needed to address teacher recruitment and retention.  A Scottish Government spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the commitment from EIS to playing its part in discussions."},{"url":null,"title":"Teachers  Overhaul homework and stop parents creating    masterpieces   ","story":"              TEACHERS have called for a radical overhaul of homework amid fears pushy parents are spending too much time creating \u0026ldquomasterpieces on behalf of their children that have no educational value.  The annual general meeting of the Educational Institute of Scotland heard a variety of examples of tasks that often resulted in too much parental help including building a Viking longship, an item of Charles Rennie Mackintosh furniture and \u0026ldquothe Arctic Circle in a box.  More serious concerns were raised about the impact on children from homes where parents gave little or no help.  And delegates also suggested the explosion in homework in recent years was because the curriculum was so crowded core learning talks were being dumped on parents.  Carolyn Ritchie, from the Glasgow branch of the EIS, said: \u0026ldquoPupils, parents and teachers are pulling their hair out over homework and we need to ask why.  \u0026ldquoThere are huge pressures on parents and it is simply wrong to assume that a child\u0026rsquos home is a calm place kitted out with an abundance of Blue Peter materials and that there are always willing assistants waiting in the wings.  \u0026ldquoHow can it be right to ask pupils to make a Viking ship or a motte and bailey castle at home in such circumstances and to praise only the few who can find the means and support to complete such a task?  She asked: \u0026ldquoAre pupils even doing it by themselves? I think not. Why did we ever buy into that myth?  Ms Ritchie said the problem was exacerbated for families living in poverty who were unable to access a computer at home or whose families were unlikely to take them to a library or museum.  She went on to suggest that an \u0026ldquoexplosion in homework in recent years was because there was no longer enough time in the school day to fit everything in.  \u0026ldquoIn the worst instances it is done to compensate for an over-crowded curriculum which is just wrong, she said.  \u0026ldquoPerhaps it is just an excuse to push some of the work that we can\u0026rsquot get through in the day on to parents in addition to the spelling and sums.  \u0026ldquoCore learning should happen in the school where you have the very best resource of a teacher to help you.  Andrene Bamford, from East Dunbartonshire, said: \u0026ldquoAt best parents are scouring craft shops and staying up to all hours helping their children create their masterpieces and at worst parents don\u0026rsquot have the time or the resources to help and this in turn helps to widen the poverty gap.  \u0026ldquoWhat do teachers do? Do they mark the \u0026ldquopupil work, do they cease giving out homework at the risk of parents saying it isn\u0026rsquot enough? We need a sensible policy to give teachers and headteachers a credible sensible policy.

Susan Quinn, from Glasgow, argued that initiatives to help poorer pupils\u0026rsquo complete additional work, such as homework clubs after school, were actually counterproductive.  She said: \u0026ldquoTeachers\u0026rsquo days can get off to a bad start if homework is not handed in on time and that can have an impact on the school day.  \u0026ldquoThere is something very wrong with a system that relies on homework."},{"url":null,"title":"Pupils being    discriminated against    because of the National 4 exam","story":"              PUPILS are being \u0026ldquodiscriminated against by Scotland\u0026rsquos system of qualifications, it has been claimed.  Teachers said pupils who sat National 4 subjects did not value it because there was no final exam.  When National 4s were introduced in 2014 as part of the scrapping of Standard Grade examiners said they would be seen as the equal of other qualifications \u0026ndash despite being internally assessed.  However, teachers and parents have warned the qualification had led to groups of pupils viewing themselves as \u0026ldquosecond class citizens compared to the more advanced National 5 which has an exam.  Figures published last summer showed the number of pupils sitting National 4 qualifications is in freefall.  The annual general meeting of the EIS teaching union heard calls for a final exam to be introduced to restore the reputation of National 4.  Gordon Black, from the EIS Dundee branch, said National 4 candidates felt marginalised at times of the school year when other pupils were preparing for exams.  \u0026ldquoNational 4 lacks sufficient demand, fails to sufficiently differentiate between candidates of different abilities and marginalises candidates at different times of the year.  John Swinburne, from the Edinburgh branch, said \u0026ldquooverwhelmingly teachers and pupils did not value National 4.  \u0026ldquoThey think it is discriminatory as a method of assessment, they feel undervalued and they want it to change, he said.  Alan Crosby, also from Edinburgh, said National 4 had to be reformed, adding: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom no fan of exams, but we have to move to a position where we are reforming National 4.  David Baxter, from the Dundee branch, said: \u0026ldquoThere is a lack of recognition of the value of the National 4 qualification and that is partly to do with the way it is structured and assessed.  However, Sonia Kordiak, from the Edinburgh branch, defended the current position.  She said: \u0026ldquoMy own experience as an English teacher is that National 4 pupils do value it. It meets the needs of particular pupils in my school in an area of multiple deprivation.  \u0026ldquoNational 4 is valued by parents, pupils and teachers. It would be illogical for us as a union to seek to have an exam type assessment when we are being critical of standardised national assessments."},{"url":null,"title":"Vital isles ferry returns to service five days ahead of schedule","story":"              A VITAL ferry, whose extended repairs caused massive travel disruption along the west coast, is to return to service today, five days ahead of schedule.  Complications during repairs to the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry meant the boat was out of action for longer than expected.  Parts of the MV Clansman\u0026rsquos propulsion system have had to be sent to Denmark for specialist repair.  The repairs had knock-on effects for other services as CalMac re-shuffled its fleet.  Within days the company handled more than 12,500 calls from worried customers.  The vessel was due back in service on Wednesday, but will now be back in service today on the scheduled Oban-Coll-Tiree route.  The vessel\u0026rsquos return allowed MV Lord of the Isles to deliver an additional Oban to Lochboisdale sailing yesterday and will restart the postponed Lochboisdale-Mallaig service today as well as delivering the Mallaig-Armadale route as scheduled.  The additional sailings scheduled on the Barra to Eriskay service will continue until Tuesday.  \u0026ldquoWe appreciate the understanding of passengers who have been disrupted by this unavoidable repair, said CalMac\u0026rsquos managing director, Robbie Drummond. \u0026ldquoWe are fully aware of the impact this has had on communities affected and would like to thank them for their patience during this period.  \u0026ldquoI would also like to thank the staff who have worked so hard to continue to provide lifeline services throughout the disruption we have had to manage over the past weeks.  \u0026ldquoWith one major vessel out of action and no replacement it has been a difficult time for everyone and we can now all look forward to normal service being resumed again.  CalMac has faced criticism over its ageing fleet and contingency plans after a wave of rearranged services \u0026ndash causing concern among passengers, communities and tourism operators.  Scotland\u0026rsquos main ferry operator has warned that passengers could face disruption this summer as a result of its ageing fleet."},{"url":null,"title":"Trooping the Colour parade to mark Queen   s official birthday","story":"              The Queen will celebrate her official birthday with the Trooping the Colour parade.  Royal fans will be eager to see the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who married exactly three weeks ago, joining other members of the royal family at the traditional summer spectacle.  Harry and Meghan are expected to ride in a carriage to the event, staged on Whitehall\u0026rsquos Horse Guards Parade, and later join members of the monarchy on Buckingham Palace\u0026rsquos balcony to watch the RAF flypast and acknowledge the crowds.  The Queen, who recently had a successful eye operation to remove a cataract, will watch the Trooping ceremony from a dais in Horse Guards and later inspect the lines of guardsmen in their scarlet tunics and bearskins.  The annual event will see more than 1,000 soldiers taking part in the traditional display\u0026nbspof pomp and pageantry. The colour being paraded this year is the flag of the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards.  The Duke of Edinburgh, who celebrates his 97th birthday on Sunday, has retired from official public duties and is not expected to attend.  The royal colonels, all on horseback, will accompany the Queen: Prince of Wales, Colonel of the Welsh Guards, the Princess Royal, Colonel of the Blues and Royals, and the Duke of Cambridge, Colonel of the Irish Guards.  Riding in the ceremony for the first time will be the Duke of York in his new role as Colonel of the Grenadier Guards.  As with previous years, the Duchess of Cambridge and the Duchess of Cornwall are expected to take part in the Queen\u0026rsquos carriage procession.  The procession will be accompanied by a Sovereign\u0026rsquos Escort of the Household Cavalry, made up of Life Guards and Blues and Royals, in their silver and gold breastplates and plumed helmets.  The massed bands of the Household Division will provide musical backing during the day and also taking part is the King\u0026rsquos Troop Royal Horse Artillery who, following the parade, will fire a 41-gun salute in Green Park to mark the Queen\u0026rsquos official birthday.  After the ceremony the royal family will head back to Buckingham Palace and gather on the balcony to watch the RAF flypast.  Among the 23 aircraft taking part are modern jets and historic aircraft, while the Red Arrows will be the finale.  Trooping the Colour originated from traditional preparations for battle. Colours, or flags, were carried, or trooped, down the rank so that they could be seen and recognised by the soldiers.  In the 18th century, guards from the royal palaces assembled daily on Horse Guards to troop the colours and in 1748 it was announced that the parade would also mark the Sovereign\u0026rsquos official birthday.  The Queen\u0026rsquos actual birthday was on April 21 when she turned 92."}]
