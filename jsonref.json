Over the next few days that’s exactly what we’ll do.”His only reference to what are anticipated to be heated debates on the climate crisis was to say the leaders would be “talking about the future of our environment” as part of their discussions, as well as the future of our economies and jobs.Morrison cited his government’s renewed focus on the region, the so-called Pacific Step-Up, saying, as he has several times before: “If you’re going to step up you have to show up, and Australia’s going to show up, we’re not just going to show up here, we’re going to show up for the hard conversations, the good conversations, the family conversations that we have, that’s very much the spirit with which we’re engaging.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21b7951eebf764e07b0ca69b056432f69be56076/135_1506_2758_1655/master/2758.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=caa034737814e0d2a3e0fb98373b7d0a","title":"book clinic what would you like to ask our experts","story":"In our weekly series you can ask experts in the books industry any questions you want answeredBook Clinic is a weekly series in the pages of the New Review section of the Observer where we will turn to experts in their field to answer any book, reading or publishing questions you may have.

It’s a nouveau roman-esque narrative about Jeanne, a woman who has methodical, anonymous sexual encounters in a series of hotel rooms across Paris with men she picks up on the street. She seems in particular to enjoy fellatio, memorising each member she encounters, storing it away in her “memory palace”. She doesn’t remember anything else about the men, and she doesn’t compare them with one another, simply files away the image to recall when she pleases: “Jeanne only has to cross the threshold and she rediscovers the shape, the form, the particular warmth, the density, the smell of the penis the elasticity of the tissue and its colour when drawn tight and when slackened the smooth or glistening appearance of the head the network of bluish blood vessels the shaded areas the wrinkled fingerprint skin of the testicles the growth pattern of the hairs.”There’s no way around it: the penis is a comic character, the Falstaff of the anatomy. In the original French, the term is sexe, which has an ambiguity of meaning (it can refer to either male or female anatomy) and tonality (the inoffensive “eh”, the pretty sexy x). The word in English is embarrassing, with its cringingly long, whiny first vowel and its truncated last syllable. In translation, the term introduces a jarringly different register from the often lyrical writing around it, here gamely rendered in Laura Francis’s resourceful translation. On the very first page, Leger compares one penis to those “paper flowers that unfold when placed on water”. While I admired the delicacy of the image, I have to admit I guffawed when I first read it. Was the dissonance deliberate, I wondered was this tongue (or some other organ) in cheek? How was I supposed to read this penis?There is levity here, but the novel is much more preoccupied with exploring the dimensions of Jeanne’s quest for pleasure. For once we are getting a woman’s point of view on the male anatomy, instead of the other way around. “Nothing in the outward appearance of a man ever foretells his penis,” Leger writes, capturing the endless fascination women can have for this intricate part of the anatomy that we do not share. Leger’s rendering of Jeanne’s penile preoccupation is virtuosic and precise while also surprising, even surrealist. The first penis she memorises “grows lighter towards the mound of the head where it becomes translucent, like an electric nightlight in a child’s bedroom”.The Collection is short and focused. Jeanne has no backstory. We will not learn what she does for a living, or what she looks like Leger refuses to explain her obsession, and this is a relief. From the 1967 film Belle de Jour to Leïla Slimani’s Adèle, the French seem to be addicted to sex addiction narratives, usually starring an inscrutable young woman having meaningless sex with strangers. Of course it’s never meaningless it’s always a symptom of something not quite right with the heroine. Jeanne looks for herself in novels of nymphomania but finds they always tell the same story: “The taste for sex itself was not a strength, but the consequence of extreme weakness” “the heroines lived only to be the objects of male desire” and they always ended up between the sheets with a man “whose penis was never described, because it was a symbol, an authority to which the weak woman who had believed herself to be strong surrendered herself, a phallus, not a cock”.The novel’s audacity did not go unremarked when it was published in France in 2017, under the title Mise en Pièces, and went on to win the Prix Anaïs Nin. Leger was invited to take part in a television talk show called On N’est Pas Couché, where the famously irascible writer Yann Moix claimed to detest the book, saying that it was “old-fashioned”, that it wasn’t as shocking as Georges Bataille’s pornographic writings, and that in his view it presented sex as an obscenity. Whether this was a wilful misreading of the novel, or a genuine inability to understand what Leger was up to, it provided a case study in why her book is urgently necessary: because there are still men out there who don’t understand how rare and revolutionary it is for a woman to write about what their penises look like to her. For a woman to adopt the surrealist approach, and show, for once, a man in pieces.• Lauren Elkin’s Flâneuse is published by Vintage.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Let’s start with a beautiful example of nominative determinism. Isabella Tree’s Wilding has affected Wellfitbooty “more than any book I’ve read in many years”:It’s the story of a large farm in Sussex, England, which chose about 20 years ago to stop intensive farming and allow its lands to return to nature. It is now home to many threatened species, including the turtle dove and emperor butterfly is home to all 5 species of British owl, 11 species of bats – and countless other insects and birds.The author is one of the owners and the style is very readable and engaging – in fact I couldn’t put it down. The principles in the book can be applied to gardens of any size … I wholeheartedly recommend it.The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13 and ¾ by Sue Townsend still works for writeronthestorm:Taking me back to my childhood when I borrowed this off my older brother and thought it was hilarious… It still stands up as a funny and enjoyable read. I’ve got the next couple of books in the series and will move onto them at some point.For the 15th time I think. I call it my summer book. It never fails to delight me.Mission To Tashkent by Frederick Marshman Bailey has impressed SchwarzwaldBummel:An incredible true-story romp about an English spy hired by Lenin’s Cheka to capture himself. Bailey a national treasure who deserves more recognition.“Thank you to everyone on here who recommended Elizabeth Taylor,” says Rick2016. “Without Tips, Links and Suggestions I’d never have discovered Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont, which proved wonderful”:It’s a quiet, understated book, but every line is so well crafted and has such power. The lessons it teaches are, when you write them down, obvious. Everyone needs love, physical contact, to feel wanted and like their company is a pleasure, not a burden. And yet it’s so easy to forget that everybody else feels these things in the cavalcade and clamour of everyday life.. Elizabeth Taylor’s empathy, compassion and ability to portray the irreducible human core of her characters are utterly remarkable and I thoroughly recommend Mrs Palfrey ... to anyone who hasn’t read it.More good work by you guys: FrogC has started reading When Mystical Creatures Attack by Kathleen Founds, “following a tip from a reader of this column”:It’s a series of linked short stories about a high-school class in Texas, most of them troubled, and their teacher who is equally so, being confined in a sort of capitalist asylum where they give Wellness Points(TM) for fulfilling various therapeutic tasks. The construction is ingenious - you might say gimmicky, but I like that kind of thing: the title story, for example, consists of the essays written by the students on how their favourite mythical creature might solve some world problem (though a lot of the problems chosen, inevitably, are on a more personal scale). Funny and moving. I love the fact that the most feared teacher is referred to simply as “The Sir”.Alexia_R has been pleased to pick up The Runaways by Fatima Bhutto:I picked this up on a whim in Foyles because it was a beautiful, signed copy. It’s a fast-paced story of three Pakistani young people (one of them British-Pakistani), negotiating their culture, religion etc. One of them is gay and struggling to accept it, another is from a very privileged background, another is from a slum of Karachi. I can’t say too much about the plot without giving it away. I was absolutely loving this and was about to praise it to the skies but I wasn’t too sure about the ending. Still, very good.RedmonT has almost finished Purity by Jonathan Franzen:Not quite as good as The Corrections and Freedom, but then that might only be because of how the account of Tom and Annabel’s relationship makes me feel. It’s awful – the feeling of dread I felt throughout that section, the nerves, the butterflies, the absurd behaviour. It’s been a long time since a book made me feel that way.He is amazing at threading stories together. It doesn’t even matter that it’s occasionally haphazard - realising things in a non-linear order affects the way you realise them (and changes what you thought you knew). There have been two or three moments that made me sit up and exclaim “FUCK” or “OH MY GOD”.I think he does something inwith his books that no other living writer does.Catch-22 attracts all the plaudits but this is well worth checking out as a study of the office environment and the feeling of ‘Is this all there is?’ It’s as sharp as TV’s Mad Men, which I suspect was influenced by it. I read about one third of the book in a single evening until the early hours. It’s that good.It is that good.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

There are Instagram accounts, podcasts and even subscription boxes dedicated to reading. Chances are you’ve noticed your friends joining book clubs or posting beautifully lit bookstagram photos. Reading is – if it ever was – cool again.Why? Perhaps for the same reason we’ve seen a surge in interest in hobbies such as jigsaws and cross-stitch: right now, our brains are saturated with digital information so it’s no surprise that we’re returning to unplugged hobbies. (But also going online to talk about them.)Being overwhelmed by information has shattered a lot of our attention. As a child with undiagnosed ADHD, I read voraciously because my brain needed constant stimulation and I didn’t yet have a phone to distract me. But as the internet became part of my life, reading lost ground and in my early 20s, I went a year without reading a book at all. But by making a conscious effort to read – partly, I confess, because of recommendations on Instagram – I’m back up to at least one book a week.It hasn’t been easy. I’m still busy, I still have ADHD and I still have myriad distractions. But here is what I’ve learned, and what might help you to fall back in love with reading in a way that fits in with our ever-online world.1. Follow book accounts on social mediaIf you’ve been away from reading for a while, it can be hard to know where to start. It can also be really tough to go from living your life online to building a separate one. By following Instagram accounts that regularly post about books, you’ll get ideas: try Book of the Month, Books on the Subway and Strand Bookstore for beautifully shot recommendations. 2. Read what you want toIf you haven’t read in a while, it can be tempting to set yourself lofty goals. For many of us that’s unrealistic, so instead: are there particular topics you’d love to read a non-fiction book about? Is there an author you’ve found easy to read before who has other books? Is there a favourite you can reread? When I’m finding it tough, I often punish myself by trying to slog through something hard before I let myself enjoy something that’s 200 pages and a laugh. But it’s enjoying the 200-pager that gets me in the swing of things, and makes it easier to concentrate on something tougher.3. Join a libraryLibraries are dying, and it’s partly because a lot of people don’t seem to consider them an option. But if finances are holding you back and you can trek to a library, it’s worth it. You can get recommendations, read for free and give up on books you can’t get into. Many have book clubs, too. For readers in the UK, you can find your nearest library here.4. Make a TBR (to be read) listHaving a realistic to-do list can be a great motivator. You can easily put one together on Goodreads, where you record what you’ve read, want to read and have read. You can also add friends, which introduces a competitive element and holds you accountable. 5. Try audiobooksIf you really can’t concentrate on reading – or set the time aside – maybe it’s a good idea to try a service such as Audible. Sure, people can be snobs about audiobooks, but they shouldn’t be. You still get the exact same information, and can participate in all the chats about the biggest book of the summer – but you can get it done while cooking dinner or out walking.6. Can’t escape your phone? Put books on itBetween work, friends and everything else, it can be hard to imagine finding time every day to read. The chances are, though, that you could. Do you commute? If you’re not forced to work on it, you can read. Lunch break? Read! I’m guilty of flicking between social media accounts whenever I get a spare five minutes. But it is just as easy for me to open the Kindle app on my phone as Twitter. Reading ebooks can be more expensive than secondhand books – but reading on my phone is often the only way I can commit.• Do you have any tips on overcoming distractions or finding your love of reading again?

The line, which links the capital with cities including Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool, has been run since privatisation by Virgin Rail.The First-Trenitalia bid was chosen over a Chinese consortium led by the Hong Kong operator MTR, First’s partner on South Western.Trenitalia has been named “shadow operator” for HS2, with responsibility for introducing new services but with a caveat that it may not go ahead, depending on the outcome of reviews into the construction of the high-speed network and the shape of the entire rail industry.First-Trenitalia will pay £1.6bn in premiums to run Britain’s most lucrative line from this December until 2026, with a second phase of payments to depend on HS2. The contract could run until 2034 with an extension.Although Keith Williams, who is leading the rail review, has said that franchising must change, he has endorsed the West Coast Partnership contract as “a step forward that is firmly in line with the review … capable of incorporating the reforms needed for the future”.The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said the contract was “a decisive shift towards a new model for rail … built with the flexibility to respond to his recommendations and deliver fundamental reform to a flawed system”.Shapps also confirmed he would proceed with a white paper for reforming rail, based on Williams’ findings, which are due in the autumn – continuing a review commissioned by his predecessor, Chris Grayling.The Department for Transport has pressed ahead with the west coast award despite a high court case being brought by Stagecoach, Sir Richard Branson’s partner in Virgin Rail. Branson said he was “devastated” by the decision.Stagecoach was disqualified for a non-compliant bid, refusing to accept pension liabilities, but sought to have the decision overturned – a legal action that recalls the fiasco in 2012 when the west coast contract was awarded to FirstGroup before being rescinded after Virgin’s complaints.Stagecoach said the award of the franchise would not have an impact on its continuing litigation against the DfT.First’s biggest shareholder, Coast Capital, has also threatened to sue the board of the company if it enters into a new rail franchise. James Rasteh, partner at Coast, told the  earlier this year it would “hold each member of management team and board member personally and fully accountable if the company enters any new rail franchise – especially in light of the value already destroyed by that ision, and the added and unknowable pension liabilities”.The previous two UK rail franchise competitions won by First – TransPennine and South Western – have proved far more costly to the company than expected. Although directors vehemently denied overbidding, First wrote down by £106m the value of its TransPennine franchise last year and last month followed up with an “onerous contract provision” of £102m for South Western.Earlier this year, First indicated it could turn its back on UK rail after the expiry of its current contracts, which also include Great Western Railway and the small, open access Hull Trains. On Wednesday First said its board “remains very aware of concerns expressed by shareholders regarding rail … however, it has unanimously concluded that signing the partnership agreement is in the best interests of all shareholders”.Labour queried the award, given the scale of First’s debts and recent losses, and coming after the cancellation of the Southeastern franchise competition. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said that awarding First such a complex contract was “a gross error of judgment”.The contract will involve handling the first HS2 services from 2026 until 2031, should the project survive despite budget challenges. High-speed trains are planned to run north on the existing mainline after the first phase of the high-speed network opens between London and Birmingham. All bidders had to demonstrate experience of running high-speed rail services, which led to First bringing onboard Trenitalia, which runs TGVs in Italy. Direct, conventional trains from London to new destinations including Gobowen, Walsall and Liverpool South Parkway are also promised in the new partnership contract.The RMT union said the award, coming on the day higher rail fares are confirmed, was “anothe‎r political fix by a government whose privatised franchise model is collapsing around their ears”.Its general secretary, Mick Cash, said the government was “taking yet another gamble on the crucial west coast lines with one of the dwindling number of private operator consortia left in the game”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b35eeb6ee3479a26ae8930fd2bf4b188b89ba3c/0_127_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3ff0052cd8d6aa3963943f0eea164be","title":"germany economy shrinks gdp recession uk inflation stock markets business live","story":"In America, traders are waking up to the news that the US yield curve has inverted.Ouch! Deutsche Bank’s economics team have predicted that Germany will fall into recession this autumn.They predict that GDP will contract in the current quarter, meeting the classic definition that a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative growth.Deutsche also warned clients that the recession could last until next year, saying:Rupert Thompson, head of research at wealth manager Kingswood, believes the European Central Bank will be forced to act to fight a German recession.This chart shows how the difference between longer-dated and shorter-dated US and UK government bond yields have fallen steadily in recent months -- leading to today’s worrying inversion.The BBC’s Faisal Islam fears that the bond yield gyrations show the global economy is in trouble - just as the Brexit crisis intensifies.European stock markets are heading further south, worried by the drama in the bond market. The UK yield curve has also inverted in the last few minutes, according to Reuters.That’s the first time since the financial crisis that Britain’s two-year government debt has traded at a higher yield than the 10-year option.James Mackintosh of the Wall Street Journal suggests British policymakers shouldn’t panic too much -- it doesn’t always herald a UK recession.The inversion of the US yield curve is a ‘massive red warning light’ for the US economy, says Neil Wilson of Markets.He points out that this is often (but not always) a harbinger of recession:It’s the first time it’s happened since 2007. Meanwhile the 30-year has slumped to a record low. The market is saying the risks are tilted very much to the downside. We are in a new phase of the cycle for markets now. To recap well-worn turf, this inversion been a reliable indicator of recession many times in the past, calling seven out of the last nine. There is undoubtedly a chance of this, although we must caution that so far the US data has been pretty sturdy in the face of global headwinds and the trade policies of the White House. This yield curve inversion is a sell signal for risk assets and should put extra pressure on equities. Futures in the US had been tracking Europe lower and are extending their declines. Yesterday’s bounce is proving short-lived.Gold pushed up higher on the news, spiking through $1506, as it cemented its recovery after yesterday’s selloff.Newsflash: The US yield curve has inverted, intensifying fears that America’s economy could be falling into recession.In normal times, longer-dated government debt should offer a better rate of return - as there’s simply more time for something to go wrong before the money is due to be repaid.So an inverted yield curve is a worrying sign -- it implies that investors are more pessimistic about future growth prospects. In the past, an inverted US yield curve has been followed by a recession.Back in the markets, shares are selling off again as investors worry about the global economy.Fears of a German recession, and news overnight that Chinese industrial production growth has hit a 17-year low, are driving the selloff. The burst of optimism of a breakthrough in the US-China trade talks, after America delayed some tariffs, may also be fading.Margaret Yang of CMC Markets explains:Here the damage:Andrew Kenningham from Capital Economics has warned that a no-deal Brexit would hurt German exporters, making a recession even more likely.“The bottom line is that the German economy is teetering on the edge of recession.”The UK and Germany - Europe’s largest economies - were also its worst-performing members in the second quarter of this year.They, along with Sweden, were the only countries to suffer a contraction in April-June.Here are some highlights from today’s growth report from Eurostat (which includes today’s German GDP data, and last week’s UK GDP)That’s according to data firm Eurostat, and matches its initial estimate of eurozone GDP released at the end of July.More to follow...The unexpected rise could pile pressure on Threadneedle Street to raise interest rates, even as economic growth falters, in a potential sign the UK could begin to mirror the stagflation of the 1970s - when growth stalled yet inflation continued to rise. The Bank has said it could be forced to raise interest rates if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, saying the pound would plunge to drive up the cost of imports. However, most analysts believe it would need to cut rates to support jobs and growth. In an ironic twist amid the public anger over British rail fares, the ONS said that little change in the price of an international train ticket over the past year prevented UK inflation from rising by a greater extent in June.

Cabinet minsters, the press, members of the public rightly demand answers: why was Newcastle airport plunged into darkness? Who is responsible for rail services being halted for hours? Threats are issued of a whopping fine, an official inquiry, heads rolling. Days of rage for a power cut of less than an hour.When it works, infrastructure is invisible. Point out the crumbliness, by all means, and lament the dangerous compromises – but as long as the wretched system judders on, voters shrug and politicians look the other way. Until the day the bridges collapse, the trains seize up and the lights no longer come on. By which time it is too late for anything but blame in 24-point headlines.Between these two extremes lies a much rarer phenomenon, which blights Britain today. We are right in the middle of an infrastructure breakdown – we just haven’t named it yet. You’ll know what I mean when we list the component parts. More than 760 youth clubs have shut across the UK since 2012. A pub closes every 12 hours. Nearly 130 libraries were scrapped last year, and those that survive in England have lopped off 230,000 opening hours.Each of the above is a news story. Each stings a different group: the books trade, the real-ale aficionados, the trade unions. But knit them together and a far darker picture emerges. Britain is being stripped of its social infrastructure: the institutions that make up its daily life, the buildings and spaces that host friends and gently push strangers together. Public parks are disappearing. Playgrounds are being sold off. High streets are fast turning to desert. These trends are national, but their greatest force is felt in the poorest towns and suburbs, the most remote parts of the countryside, where there isn’t the footfall to lure in the businesses or household wealth to save the local boozer.When I am out reporting it is not uncommon to go into a suburban postcode short of money yet still bustling with people – but the banks have nearly all cleared out, the church has gone and all that’s left of the last pub is an empty hulk. The private sector has buggered off, the state is a remote and vengeful god who dispenses benefits or sanctions, and the “big society” never made it out of the pages of a report from a Westminster thinktank. I’ve seen this in the suburbs of London and in the valleys of south Wales, and the word that most comes to mind is “abandoned”.Politicians bemoan the loss of community, but that resonant word is not precise enough. A large part of what’s missing is social infrastructure. It can be public or private. It is often slightly dog-eared and usually overlooked. But when it vanishes, the social damage can be huge.The American sociologist Eric Klinenberg lists some in his recent book, Palaces for the People: “People reduce the time they spend in public settings and hunker down in their safe houses. Social networks weaken. Crime rises. Older and sick people grow isolated. Younger people get addicted to drugs … Distrust rises and civic participation wanes.” A New York University professor, Klinenberg’s observations hold as true for Brexit Britain as they do for Trump’s America. How often have you read about a grandmother found dead in her own home, with no one popping by for days? How many news stories do you read about teenagers experiencing mental illness as they compare themselves to the images on their screens? And how many times have you complained that everyone is so stuck in their own bubble that politics is hopelessly polarised?When it comes to transport or energy or sewage, Britain has a National Infrastructure Commission that monitors the country’s needs and guides parliament on where to direct spending. After all, the quality of such hard infrastructure influences where multinationals set up shop: it is money-making. But parks and libraries don’t generate cash. Social infrastructure has no lobby, no registry of assets and certainly no government agency. No Whitehall official monitors how much of it has closed or withered away – that relies on civil society groups to file freedom of information requests or badger town halls with survey. Everyone knows we need it, yet just as our economic model prizes shareholder returns over investment in the National Grid, so our politics relies on drawing in the voters with unfeasibly low taxes. Until one day, something breaks and all hell breaks loose.So here is a suggestion for Jeremy Corbyn or Nicola Sturgeon or Adam Price or whoever else fancies it. Talk about the importance of social infrastructure. Promise to set up a commission explicitly to audit what we have and help protect it. Commit public money to it, alongside gentle pressure on the private sector to do its bit. That way, we can publicly mark the public institutions we all know we need – and show the esteem due to the people who keep them going and use them. The spirit we need is that summed up by the librarian who rhapsodises to Klinenberg about his branch: “The library really is a palace. It bestows nobility on people who can’t otherwise afford a shred of it. People need to have nobility and dignity in their lives. And, you know, they need other people to recognise it in them too.”Our people deserve palaces."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69a1f52971e35427022135ccbe0672f133916ac5/0_32_4888_2932/master/4888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b712b47153468f2c336856ee21b1abbc","title":"labour scrap predicted grades university admissions fairer","story":"Hundreds of thousands of students will receive their A-level results on Thursday. It is the end product of two years of hard work, and many will be hoping it is also the start of their next educational journey.Unfortunately, not all of them will have a fair chance to take that next step. Our higher education admissions process is neither fair nor effective.That is why the next Labour government will scrap predicted grades and introduce post-qualification admissions (PQA). This means that students will apply for higher education courses after they receive their exam results. It will make our higher education system fairer, giving all students the chance to reach their potential regardless of their background, instead of a system that reinforces privilege and inequality.Underestimating grades has serious consequences for a student’s choice of university, and their future. Students who are highly able but whose grades are underpredicted are unlikely to apply to the most selective universities. Their options, therefore, are unfairly limited – and far too many are held back from reaching their full potential.This unfairness is not random and it is certainly not equally felt by all students. Errors in grade prediction hit working-class students particularly hard, because students from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to have their grades underpredicted. In its current form, our higher education admissions system is a barrier to students’ success instead of supporting them.The Sutton Trust found that almost 3,000 disadvantaged, high-achieving students have had their grades underpredicted. Working-class students have already borne the brunt of the Tories’ cuts losing their educational maintenance allowance in England and university grants, quite apart from the trebling of university tuition fees.Our admissions system should be a vehicle for justice, but it is failing working-class students, especially those who are the first in their family to go to university. Working-class students more often lack the advice, guidance and support needed to navigate the tricky application process, whereas their wealthy peers at top public schools have admissions tutors to help their students game the system. There is similar evidence that the system works against ethnic minority applicants too.The current system of predicted grades has also led to the rise of unconditional offers, and “conditional-unconditional” offers, where an offer is only made unconditional if a student makes that university their firm choice. While some unconditional offers may be justified, it is clear that they too add to the inequality we see in the opportunities that are available to students from different backgrounds.Our education system must work for students and it must be driven by fairness, not market forces. Scrapping predicted grades and introducing post-qualification admissions will bring England in line with the rest of the world. As it stands, it is the only country with over a million students where a pre-qualification system is used.Reforming admissions is a key part of our plan to transform higher education to make it genuinely accessible to all. This includes restoring the educational maintenance allowance and maintenance grants in England, as well as scrapping tuition fees for both college and universities.Only the Labour party is committed to making education – from the early years to lifelong learning – both free and genuinely accessible to all.• Angela Rayner is Labour MP for Ashton-under-Lyne and shadow education secretary"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a0a2292958908756f152f58dbb9ca3dc2d1c306/0_0_2546_1527/master/2546.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abaf773d8c9fe327a57f530ab3426cab","title":"simone biles defiant joy dark times","story":"Biles has made history yet again – and has every reason to celebrateAmid depressing news these days like abortion bans, mass shootings, and rampant Hollywood sexual assault cases, it can be easy to overlook an event so uplifting that it almost sounds like science fiction. Just a few days ago gymnast Simone Biles, who already defied all laws of gravity when she became the most decorated female athlete at the 2016 Rio Olympics (tying with US swimmer Katie Ledecky), nailed the riskiest balance beam dismount in the sport’s history at the US national championships: a double-double, or a double somersault with a full twist in each flip. And if that wasn’t badass enough, the next day she nailed the triple double on the floor exercise, which is a double back somersault with three twists.Then, like the multidimensional supernova she is, Biles posted a pic of herself on Instagram donning a hilariously huge Kool-Aid smile following her record-breaking achievement with the caption: “That feeling when you make history... twice.” That candid image of victory managed to transform our collective mood, even if just for a moment, from overwhelmingly dour to gleeful because it is the face of a happy young black woman who had just served notice to her her predominantly white competitors across the world in a sport that has yet to truly embrace the brilliance of women of color. That’s what you call defiant joy.It’s a state of mind that Biles has had to learn to master in a global forum that has been none too kind to brown-skinned female athletes like her and teammate Gabrielle Douglas, who’ve been criticized for everything from their muscular bodies to their hair. Italian gymnast Carlotta Ferlito, who Biles edged out for a medal on the balance beam at the 2013 world championships, has since apologized for flippantly saying, “Next time we’ll have our skin black also, so we can win too.”Let’s be really clear about what’s happening here. Biles, like her predecessor Dominique Dawes who became the first African-American woman to win an inidual Olympic medal in artistic gymnastics in 1994, isn’t racking up medals because of her skin color, or because black women are presumably having a pop culture moment, or because of affirmative action or any other agenda that hinges on political correctness. She is winning because she is tremendously talented. I know that’s a difficult realization for some to hear (Ferlito, I’m looking at you and your peers), but black women are and have always been—like pop star Rihanna once said—on a whole other level.And Biles has been basking in that. Like tennis icon Serena Williams, she’s a woman who’s come to celebrate her “stockier” physique after body shamers tried to make her feel bad about it. In 2016, just weeks before she swept the Olympics, the gymnast told Teen Vogue, “I was built this way for a reason, so I’m going to use it.” That appreciation for herself and haters-be-damned approach to her work has helped clench a new generation of gymnastics enthusiasts glued to their television screens, enraptured with every contortion, flip, and awe-inspiring move she makes. She is, despite the prevailing whiteness of the sport, its main attraction—regardless of whether or not the powers that be care to admit it.But beyond being a phenomenon on the international stage , Biles has also proven to be a force to be reckoned with off the mat. In 2018, she bravely came forward about disgraced former USA gymnastics physician Larry Nassar sexually assaulting her, resonating with other black #MeToo survivors whose stories have too often been dismissed. Even despite this deeply traumatic event, Biles continued to flash that mega-watt smile, defeat the competition, and nurture an envious personal life that includes her relationship with boyfriend Stacey Ervin, Jr, director and head coach at the World Champions Centre, whose pics on social media are the epitome of #couplegoals.Her positivity has garnered countless speaking engagements, fashion ads where she’s flaunting her covetable curves in haute couture, over 3 million social media followers (and steadily climbing), who cling to her every post for a daily dose of encouragement.Biles is, after all, a woman who has had to overcome more seemingly insurmountable challenges that anyone of any age or race should have to encounter, especially in front of a live international audience. But even more impressive than that, she’s managed to give us all something to smile about in this world where hate and intolerance often dominate our regular conversations. She’s given us hope."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d366f8136095b66824c71315e1d09b4fa016f5e2/97_84_2765_1659/master/2765.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8e20d3cd0a9fdb070e85f1da7daed5d","title":"alan partridge saves steve coogan from lengthy driving ban","story":"Actor barred for two months after arguing longer ban would mean cancelling new seriesSteve Coogan has escaped a lengthy driving ban after successfully arguing that a new series featuring his Alan Partridge character could not be filmed on public transport.The comedian was clocked driving his Porsche at 36mph in a 30mph zone close to his mansion in East Sussex, earning him a three-point endorsement on his driving licence. Because he already had nine points from previous offences he faced an automatic six-month ban.Magistrates in Crawley instead decided to ban him from driving for two months after hearing that a lengthier time off the road would force him to cancel an Alan Partridge travelogue series he is set to make for the BBC.Coogan told the court that in the series, which he is due to film in October, Partridge drives to various locations around Britain meeting people: “I’m producing a travelogue follow-on TV series where I’m basically driving around Britain. The whole nature of the series is that it is a travelogue and it’s an artistic thing that he drives and that defines his character.”The actor argued that his Partridge character, who in one series drove barefoot to Dundee after gorging on Toblerone and owned a Lexus he described as “the Japanese Mercedes”, was inherently wedded to the road. “You couldn’t put him on a train because that not who he is. It’s part of his character that he drives,” he said.Coogan told the court that the camera shots could not be faked: “You have cameras mounted on the bonnet then you have other shots where you have a camera mounted on a separate car filming the person in the car driving.”He said his Baby Cow production company has lined up between 15 and 20 staff to work on the series and they would struggle to find alternative work if he cancelled at short notice.The court heard the actor had a history of speeding offences and had attended a drivers awareness course just two months ago.Coogan admitted his driving record was not good, but said he had now taken steps to change his behaviour: “I’m trying to slow down and I try to observe the average speed limits that have come in. I tend to drive the one, the car, with the automatic cruise control that will keep me within the speed.”Ann Schroder, the chair of the magistrates bench, said they had taken into account the “exceptional hardship” it would cause other TV professionals if the series had to be cancelled. She told Coogan: “We have also taken into account your driving record, which is not very good.”Magistrates gave him three penalty points and disqualified him from driving for two months. They also fined him £750 with £85 court costs and a £75 victim surcharge.Coogan is a noted motoring enthusiast who has owned a succession of cars including Ferraris, Mazdas, Range Rovers and Porsches.He escaped a driving ban after saying he was unable to remember who had been driving when his car was allegedly clocked speeding in Hove. He was fined £670 and banned from driving for 28 days in February 2016 after being caught speeding at almost twice the limit in Brighton."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/602eaa4df02f977488f92e9b5935ac4ab0c4a005/281_187_3719_2232/master/3719.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d523d890b85f69329748e839358e5e0f","title":"labour wants universities to offer places after exam results","story":"Party aims to stop students from being hindered by inaccurate A-level forecastsSchool-leavers’ anxious wait for university places in England could be ended under proposals by Labour that would delay the admissions process until after exam results are published, ending controversial practices that penalise disadvantaged students.Angela Rayner, Labour’s education secretary, said the next Labour government would undertake an overhaul of the structure and timing of the higher education admissions system in England, to avoid relying on inaccurate A-level grade forecasts and to halt the controversial use of unconditional offers for school-leavers.The announcement comes as more than 300,000 school-leavers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland await the results of their A-levels and other qualifications later this week, with the majority holding offers of undergraduate places dependent on achieving specific grades.In most cases the offers are the result of applications made in January or earlier, but under Rayner’s plan the decision-making process at English institutions would be delayed until after 18 and 19-year-olds have had their exams marked and received their grades.“The higher education admissions system isn’t working for students and radical action is needed to change that. Predicted grades are wrong in the vast majority of cases and disadvantaged students in particular are losing out on opportunities on the basis of those inaccurate predictions,” Rayner said.Labour said a new admissions system would require consultation with schools and universities but would end England’s unusual status in requiring students to apply without knowing if they have achieved the right grades, leading to more than one in five students not receiving their first choice of course.Research has found that around 1,000 high-achieving students from disadvantaged backgrounds have their grades under-predicted each year, which can force them to wait a year to reapply to highly selective institutions such as Cambridge or Imperial College London.Rayner pledged that a new streamlined admissions system would be introduced by the end of Labour’s first term in office.“No one should be left out of our education system just because of their background, yet with grants scrapped and fees tripled, the system is now deeply unfair,” Rayner said.“We will put students at the heart of the system, making it fairer, more accurate, and a genuine vehicle for social justice. We will work with schools, colleges and universities to design and implement the new system, to make higher education genuinely accessible to all.”Sir Peter Lampl, founder of the Sutton Trust, backed the overhaul proposed by Labour. “The current system is based on students’ predicted grades which are wrong most of the time,” he said. “Our research has found that high-attaining, disadvantaged students are more likely to have their grades under-predicted than their better-off peers.“Moving to a system of post-qualification applications would empower the student to make the best university choice for them.”The change could require substantial changes to the timing of A-levels or the start of the university year for new undergraduates, although Rayner points out that, in other developed countries, applicants do not decide on offers before they receive exam grades.In Finland, for example, final exams are taken in March before applications open, and offers made in July.Rayner told BBC’s Radio 4 programme that Labour are willing to change the academic calendar to fit with their proposal. She said: “I want students to be able to make choices based upon their actual grades and be supported through that process. If that means we have to adjust the academic year slightly to make that happen, I think its important we do that because our system has to be fair.” Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders that represents many secondary school heads in England, warned that Labour’s proposals “represent a significant and complex change”.“It would be extremely difficult to manage the entire applications process in the few weeks between A-level results in mid-August and the beginning of university terms in September or October, and it is likely that we would need to rethink the entire calendar,” Barton said.School-leavers apply through the Ucas service, which also advertises courses available after exam results are published under a process known as clearing, a route that has become more popular in recent years as universities have aggressively expanded while the number of school-leavers in the population has been falling.Clare Marchant, the chief executive of Ucas, said the application timeframe would need to change to give universities and students more time to make their decisions.“Young people need their teachers’ support when making application choices, and this isn’t readily available to all at the scale required when schools and colleges are closed during August,” Marchant said.“Universities and colleges need time for interviews, auditions, and considering contextual information about applicants, and time to put in place support services to help care leavers, first in family, and disabled students, transition into higher education.”But the move was strongly supported by Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, which represents many university staff.“The current system, based on inaccurately predicted results, is failing students. It is time we adopted the type of system used around the rest of the world where university offers are based on actual achievements instead of guesswork,” Grady said.Rayner’s proposal would only apply to institutions in England, and potentially to applicants living in England, because education policy is devolved to national governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, with Scotland already using post-qualification admissions (PQA) for its domestic applicants."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f1dd8c40b6d486377977a3b65dc2df63cda7270/0_999_3147_1889/master/3147.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db08afcf30d153e0d8e4f5fac678e23d","title":"less fun english declines as choice for a level pupils","story":"Claims made that new qualifications are ‘sucking the joy’ out of the subject Ministers are being urged to review recently reformed English GCSEs because of concerns that the new qualifications are “sucking the joy” out of the subject and may be putting students off pursuing it at a higher level.According to provisional data from the exams watchdog Ofqual, entries for English language A-level dropped from just under 18,000 in 2018 to less than 14,000 this year. Uptake was also down for English literature, from 41,000 to 37,500, while combined English language and literature dropped from 9,000 to 7,600.“We should be very, very concerned at this drop in the study of English,” said the author and former teacher Joanne Harris, whose works included the best-selling novel Chocolat. “This, combined with the loss of so many public libraries, could be the start of a catastrophic decline in the quality of our secondary students, graduates and future colleagues and employees.”The award-winning poet, novelist and teacher Kate Clanchy, who is writer-in-residence at Oxford Spires Academy, where she sees the impact of the reformed GCSEs on pupils, said: “English has just been made less fun. It’s hard to describe just how deeply disastrous it is. English is under pressure in universities as well. We need these people to come through.”This year’s A-level cohort, who will receive their results on Thursday, were the first to sit the new GCSE English qualifications introduced in 2017 as part of the former education secretary Michael Gove’s sweeping qualification changes, which were intended to make exams more rigorous and challenging.Teachers have since expressed concerns that the new GCSE English language exam is focused too heavily on analysis of historical texts, while English literature involves memorising large amounts of content. The changes, they say, have hit the least able the hardest.One assistant headteacher said: “GCSE English language is sucking the joy out of the study of how we communicate: the power and beauty in words. English literature favours those with excellent memories it has reduced our most magnificent pieces of writing to a collection of quotations.”Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “It is right that we should have the highest aspirations for all our students, but this should not equate to turning exams into a joyless slog. We are concerned that the current GCSE specifications are failing to encourage a love of English in young people and this year’s entries at A-level appear to confirm our fears.”Other factors may also be at play, including the government’s drive to increase the uptake of science, technology, engineering and maths – the Stem subjects.“English has always been thought of (quite wrongly) as an ‘easy’ (or even vocationally irrelevant) subject for English native speakers. It’s not,” said Harris. “Falling levels of literacy suggest that its importance in all areas of the curriculum – and indeed, in life – has not been sufficiently emphasised.“It also doesn’t help when politicians make untrue and ill-advised comments about the lack of career opportunities in the arts or indeed when secondary education is constantly portrayed as solely vocational, rather than a means of enriching a person’s life experience.“It is vitally important that the government now pays attention to what teachers have been saying for years: that the way to promote literacy is to make reading enjoyable, instead of using it as a means of returning to a failed agenda of ‘literary tradition’, rote-learning and pointless, demoralising testing.”The writer and poet Michael Rosen, who is the professor of children’s literature at Goldsmiths, University of London, said the new English literature GCSE was more “mechanical” and less about creative interpretation of books. “The student’s own response is not seen as relevant. For some people who before might have thought English was worth a go, they’ve felt that maybe it’s not what they thought English was going to be about,” he said.Dr Rebecca Fisher, the chief executive of the English Association, said: “Without a erse, rich, engaging curriculum at GCSE, more students will be discouraged from pursuing their studies at A-level, but it’s important to acknowledge the other factors, such as the government’s support for Stem subjects at the cost of the arts and humanities, and the misperception of risk associated with studying humanities subjects in a period of economic instability.”The Department for Education insisted English remained one of the most popular subjects: “We are confident that the reformed GCSEs in English are better preparing pupils for further study at A-level.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/877d572c4020666e4174ecd72503bccadaf0cec8/0_0_1955_1173/master/1955.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e06e33f8780aff7633eaede83e874c3c","title":"what the stars can teach us about travelling in style","story":"Mia Farrow opted for a kaftan while Marilyn Monroe went for high heels. What can vintage celebrity fashion tell us about cool, comfortable travel?Air travel was nothing if not a photo opportunity for Marilyn Monroe, one of Hollywood’s first jet-setters. A tiny clutch bag suggests a seat in first class (no lugging a jumper and snacks around), while carrying a book about a former president implies an aspirational approach to in-flight entertainment. Ever checked your step-count after a day in the air? You may have crossed oceans, but you’ll walk mere metres – meaning white stilettos aren’t as impractical as they may at first appear.Style tip: Dress for the flight you want, not the flight you are booked on. Leah HarperCirca 1968 – post-Rosemary’s Baby, pre-The Great Gatsby – Mia Farrow stepped off a plane in London wearing an embroidered, full-length kaftan, promptly redefining the style rules of long-haul travel. The actor had just returned from two months of transcendental meditation in India – where she presumably picked this piece up – and the relaxed lines of her diaphanous gown clearly reflected her mood. Until then, Farrow had been the poster girl for baby-doll dresses, thigh-skimming hemlines and Peter Pan collars. This arrival-hall look at Heathrow heralded the start of a new sartorial era for the star, not to mention a lesson in how to fuse comfort and style.Style tip: This is a hard-working holiday outfit: a roomy kaftan or a maxidress is a perfect beach cover-up, nightie or comfy airport option. Scarlett ConlonDavid Bowie, seen here at London Victoria train station in 1973, just a few days after he hung up his platforms as Ziggy Stardust, had the right idea when it came to what to wear on the Great British rail network. A chameleon of style, his sartorial prowess clearly stretched to travel dressing with layers preparing him for window drafts, as well as overzealous air-conditioning and heating. His flight jacket would double up nicely as a pillow. But, as was his wont, it is not all sensible: dungarees may be comfortable, but they’re not ideal for a train bathroom.Style tip: Wear a shallot’s worth of layers and take a scarf for a pillow – but opt for an all-in-one only if you have unshakeable faith in the integrity of the electric locking system of train loos. Ellie Violet BramleyThe doyenne of airport chic, Jane Birkin not only pioneered the now-much-imitated all-white look, but established one of the world’s most famous handbags while in transit. The story goes that she was sitting next to the Hermès CEO Jean-Louis Dumas in 1984 when the overhead locker burst open and the contents of her bag fell out. He said he should make her a bag and name it after her. She agreed. The rest is fashion history. When she didn’t have her namesake accessory on the crook of her arm, her airport vessel of choice was at the opposite end of the style spectrum: a fruit basket. Worn with her signature white jeans, blazer and an air of insouciance, the cheap-and-easy accessory went to show that true style is born of attitude, not just altitude, and inspired a million modern-day iterations.Style tip: Opt for a squishy raffia (rather than structured bamboo) basket bag that will squeeze under your seat – no one likes the sound of snapping twigs.

It is also the perfect opportunity to tap into trends – see Beyoncé in a tie-dye wrap dress on Lake Como – and wear clothes you don’t mind getting wet. Heels are fine, too. Decking is no match for Queen Bey.Style tip: Don’t take being part of the Beyhive too literally when travelling by boat pack a hairband. You’re going to need it.

Along with the serving temperature, that’s why this is a dish to save for high summer, and then gorge yourself on for a few short weeks.Put the bread in a shallow bowl, cover with cold water, then leave to soak for 20 minutes – very fresh or soft bread will just dissolve to mush, so if you haven’t managed to find any stale or particularly crusty stuff, give it a quick toast beforehand, to dry it out a bit.Roughly dice the tomatoes – don’t worry about seeding or skinning them, because everything will be sieved out later – and deseed and dice the peppers. (Note: I like its herbaceous bitterness, but if you’re one of those people who hates green pepper, use two red ones instead.)Peel and dice the cucumber, and put it in a blender or food processor with the tomatoes and peppers. Peel and crush the garlic, and add that, too, then squeeze out and tear in the bread. Finish with the olive oil and whizz smooth. (Alternatively, use a large bowl and a stick blender to do the same thing.)Pass the soup through a fine sieve, discard the solids, then stir in the vinegar and season to taste with salt. Cover and refrigerate until well chilled – I think it’s much nicer cold than at room temperature, but you can eat it immediately, if you prefer.You can serve the soup just as it is, with perhaps a swirl of olive oil and a little black pepper to finish, but if you want to make a whole meal out of it, add some more substantial garnishes. Pick a couple from the following options, or add them all if you want to show off.Put two eggs in a pan of cold water and bring to a boil. Turn the heat down to a simmer, then cook for seven and a half minutes. Dunk in cold water until cool enough to handle, then peel. Finely dice the egg, mixing together the whites and yolks, and season lightly.Stone and finely chop eight black or green olives. Peel a quarter-cucumber, cut in half lengthways, discard the seeds and watery core, then finely dice the flesh. Deseed and dice half a red, yellow or green pepper, or even a mild chilli. Roughly chop the leaves from two sprigs of mint or parsley. Thinly slice two spring onions. Cut two slices of cured ham into thin strips.Divide the chilled soup between four bowls, scatter all or some of these toppings artistically across the top (bearing in mind that some of them will sink fairly quickly), and finish with a dash of olive oil and a little freshly ground black pepper. Alternatively, put all the garnishes on the table for people to help themselves as they wish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76c528b437fc0fd14b14879bb8b78936c2bce2a9/0_210_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1225ebb4d9dc1d96702d098412f45e6a","title":"the kim joy baking contest can guardian readers master a pigfiterole","story":"She creates some of the world’s cutest bakes, but how easy are they to pull off? Lauren, Rowan and Tair went to Kim-Joy’s kitchen to find out – and compete furiouslyAs the nation collectively puts on the kettle before this year’s Great British Bake Off, Kim-Joy – perhaps the biggest breakout star of last year’s show – is hosting her own warm-up competition.In her candy-coloured home in Yorkshire are three amateur bakers sent by the  to compete to be Kim-Joy’s Baker of the Day. At stake – an edible medal baked by Kim-Joy herself.When I arrive, Kim-Joy and the bakers are drinking tea and looking jolly. There are three cows in the field outside, a mere iced-bun’s throw away, and bees are buzzing about the yellow-lidded bins inside.Kim-Joy and her partner, Nabil, have just returned from San Diego Comic-Con. Jetlagged, but very relaxed, they are manning a pale yellow KitchenAid mixer, while three of the gamest bakers this side of the Bake Off tent look on.There’s Lauren, who only realised how far her hobby had got out of hand when her boss introduced her to a visiting colleague as “Lauren. She bakes”. Taking treats in to work was her way of dealing with her fears that people wouldn’t like her, she says. These days, it is mostly her workmates who are afraid: frightened that she will stop. Her most recent triumph was a mango mousse cake – although she is proud of the fact her colleagues now come in to work asking for advice on cookie baking times, having followed in her baking footsteps.Next up is Rowan who, like Lauren, has been baking since she was four. Her mother, she says, starts planning Christmas in August, and now delegates the entire sweet section to her. When a friend mentioned today’s contest, she thought: “I’ll probably be doing that at home anyway.” She works at a publishing house and sits down the hall from the cookbook department, meaning taking in treats can be nerve-racking. But her boundless creativity (she also runs artistic retreats and creates video essays about queer culture and film) and her knack for a good flavour combo has won over every colleague.And then there is Tair, a customer service specialist and serial 10k runner, who has been baking since 2006. It all started when he encountered a bonkers multilayered dessert that featured a sweet pie baked into each tier of cake. His friends have had to move to another country, just to get away from the calories he was plying them with.“I took up baking so people would like me,” he says. “But then they started hating me because they were putting on weight.” He has even written a play about the pitfalls of baking, which he is now turning into a book. It is a cautionary tale, he says: “Like HP Lovecraft, but with cookies.”Kim-Joy has never had this many people in her kitchen, and she loves it. “Usually, it’s just me on my own, with Nabil looking at me going: ‘How have you made all this mess?’”I decide this is going to be just like the tent, only much better.The recipes are from Kim-Joy’s forthcoming cookbook, a compendium of edible cuteness. The plan is for the guest bakers to collaborate on baking, then compete on decorating.“Do you have enough ingredients?” asks Nabil.“I think so …” says Kim-Joy.On your marks, get set, bake!The three bakers take it in turns to squeeze blobs of dough into the chilled tray’s shell-shaped moulds. When it is time to slide the day’s first bake into the oven, everyone crowds around and sings with joy.Things get serious when the madeleines have cooled down, however, and Kim-Joy declares that it is time to “start dipping”. There is silence in the kitchen. You could hear a chocolate sprinkle drop.After testing the black icing for consistency, Rowan cautiously pipes on her first panda face. It is a bit wonky. She promptly calls him Boris, and says she may just eat him. Lauren is next, and Rowan channels Jonathan from Queer Eye: “Look at this confidence! YASSS!” Tair is a picture of stoic calm – until his whole body heaves a huge sigh of relief and I realise he hadn’t been breathing.The rack fills up with a menagerie of panda-ish creatures – some mouse-like, some sleeping, one with a goatee – and I gain a new appreciation for the skill involved in drawing on sponge with liquid sugar.In this challenge a batch of profiteroles have their tops sliced off before being filled with strawberry cream and given piggy faces with icing and pink marzipan.Kim-Joy’s recipe says they are “quick and actually so simple” to make. The level of collective concentration, though, would suggest this is optimistic. Just watching the bakers peer into the oven to check if the choux balls are browning makes me feel nervous, and that is well before they have turned them into baby boars.Rowan whips some cream with freeze-dried strawberry powder and sugar, then dribbles in some pink food dye. Lauren methodically makes all her marzipan snouts then heads to the stove to melt dark chocolate which will act as mud. When Tair has finished slicing and dolloping pink cream, he anxiously starts icing faces. It only requires two little dots for the eyes and two smaller dots for the nostrils. But a shake of the hand here or a squeeze of the piping bag there and things can quickly take a turn for the monstrous. Our bakers are not to be undone by royal icing, though. Their composure is impressive.“Shall we get a plate for each of you so you can mud up?” Kim-Joy asks.Tair dishes up a bold puddle and plops his four little piggies down in a row. Rowan plates hers first then dribbles and flings the melted chocolate with Jackson Pollock-style abandon. Lauren’s plate is minimalist, with the chocolate poured into a smooth pool and the piglets huddled at its edge.The three of them take a moment to smudge their anxious brows and appraise. Nabil brings round a tray of cheese sarnies. Everyone tucks in. Competitive baking is hungry work.Kim-Joy conquered spice week with a show-stopping chandelier made of these beauties. Today, she has prepped the dough ahead of time (a salted butter, black treacle and muscovado mixture, spiced with cinnamon and cloves). “What do you guys fancy decorating?” she asks as she tips out two entire boxes of cookie-cutters on the floor and uncovers a basket of food dyes.They settle on cacti and llamas. Tair opts for egg-yolk yellow, Lauren, cerise pink and Rowan, a light and a dark forest green. Kim-Joy takes a selfie with the bakers and their piping bags just as a butterfly flies up to the door.“Can things possibly get cuter?” I whisper softly to no one in particular. The contestants get decorating.Kim-Joy hands out toothpicks for fixing holes – or “for wiggling”, as she puts it – and candy rocks, sprinkles and shimmer pearls. “Oh, I got some eyes, too, if you want to make it crazy.”“Dammit, no, wasp, not right now,” says Rowan as yet another stripy inspector takes an interest in her sugar work.Lauren is wiggling, too, bent over the kitchen counter as if her life depends on it. She oozes precision, commitment and focus, as she delicately pokes the icing to create a prickly texture. She dots her succulents with white-icing thorns and sets them in a bed of coloured rock-sugar topsoil.Meanwhile, I fear Tair has stopped breathing again. He smothers his three cacti and lone llama in yellow, then bejewels the lot with red, pink and brown blooms.There is half an hour to go and everyone suddenly realises that, contrary to GBBO tradition, no one has been calling out timings. The whole day has unspooled without the slightest glitch, largely because Kim-Joy is a master of time management.Tair is the first to finish, so we have a bit of a chinwag. How is the book going to develop? “Well,” he says, “I need to work out the recipes. And it will involve a celebrity chef who is also an elephant. A bit Jamie Oliver, a bit Gordon Ramsay. He’s a bit of an ego, but gets brought down to size.” Time is up. Kim-Joy looks nervous for the first time. She says she wants everyone to win.She was up at 1am (the jetlag) baking a biscuit medal for the winner. “It’s the worst thing I’ve ever decorated,” she insists, then disappears upstairs to deliberate, yelling down for Nabil to bring up her edible pens which she has stashed in her pen pot.Downstairs, the bakers and I catch up. It transpires that none of them knew this would be a Kim-Joy event: this wasn’t about the celeb factor. No, it was, is and always will be – for each of them – about the baking. And the day has not let them down. They have relished the fine decorating, the communal baking and being part of a team.Kim-Joy comes back down with books, pin badges and that biggest, kindest of smiles. She announces the winner. Lauren! That final procession of colourful cacti set on a bed of edible sediment seems to have been the deciding factor.The beautiful biscuit medal falls off its green ribbon instantly, which gives her permission to dig right in and eat it. Lauren, Tair and Rowan finally taste their wares.The table looks like a Technicolor feast. The photographer, Chris, can’t quite believe what they have accomplished. Kim-Joy has loved baking with the trio so much that Nabil suspects she may want to do this every weekend.There’s no doubt in my sugar-sated mind that all three are potential star bakers and each has a chance at a Paul Hollywood handshake. Get yourselves signed up for the TV show sharpish: the country’s cuppa’s getting cold.Baking with Kim-Joy is published by Quadrille on 22 August and is available for pre-order from bookshop"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7210d5be6cba2f652d143d0a0f87c219f6e983d1/0_88_7143_4287/master/7143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f559f4b53e55fe0bec0996da197d72e5","title":"celtic cluj champions league qualifier match report","story":"Neil Lennon bemoaned a “wasted” first half and some self-destructive defending after his Celtic side crashed out of the Champions League.Celtic were heading out on away goals before George Tucudean netted with the last kick of the ball to seal a 4-3 win for Cluj at Celtic Park and a 5-4 aggregate victory for the Romanian side. Celtic’s first two efforts on target came in the opening minutes of the second half and they came from a goal down to lead just after the hour mark through James Forrest and Odsonne Edouard. They had chances for a third but a handball under no pressure from Scott Brown allowed Billel Omrani to level from the spot and the goalscorer struck again four minutes after Ryan Christie’s quickfire response.The manager said: “The first half we were so passive, no tempo, I don’t know where that came from. We weren’t physical or aggressive enough and certainly didn’t work hard enough to stop crosses, second balls. We got a warning beforehand and didn’t stop the cross and then we do the exact same thing again. At half-time we got after them a little bit and got the right response but we shot ourselves in the foot with the goals we conceded. We had the lead twice and we have given it away.“The first goal you are thinking ‘right, wake-up call’, the second goal was an inidual mistake, the third goal we had plenty of defenders back but we just let the guy run off us and get the shot away and should have done better with the rebound. The fourth goal is academic because we are trying to throw everything at them to get an equaliser. We had enough chances to win the game but we wasted 45 minutes. If we had played anywhere near as well in the first half as we did second half, we would have been through.”Lennon explained why he dropped Boli Bolingoli and started the midfielder Callum McGregor at left-back.“Just to get Olivier Ntcham in midfield because he has been playing well and to have a couple of technicians on the field as well, and we know Boli has been a bit up and down with his form,” he said.Celtic now drop down to the Europa League play-offs where they will face AIK Stockholm or the Moldovan side Sheriff, with the Swedish team 2-1 up going into their home leg.“It’s hugely disappointing for us all,” Lennon said. “We are going to have to accept the criticism that comes our way whether it be from the media or our own supporters or elsewhere.“We have to regroup and make sure we qualify for the Europa League and make a strong claim in that.The Cluj head coach, Dan Petrescu, led Unirea Urziceni to a 4-1 win over Rangers at Ibrox in 2009 but declared this win a greater achievement.“I can’t believe it, it’s the second time I have played in the Champions League in Scotland and my team scored four goals,” he added.“I never expected that. I told my players they would have to play the game of their lives and told them it would be a miracle if Celtic didn’t score, because they have so much quality they can win against any team in Europe. It’s one of the best victories in my career.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a654f08d14be96cf17eaad4fc6bd402f8f87eb93/0_0_2674_1604/master/2674.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39c45334ce7f150460def7a46d0d3dde","title":"frank lampard chelsea spoil liverpool super cup party","story":"Chelsea manager’s rollercoaster start continues in city where Liverpool enjoyed their greatest Champions League winWeek one as a competitive Premier League manager and Frank Lampard feels he has already experienced the rollercoaster that is life in charge of Chelsea. Not quite. It has been a week without highs so far. The first all-English Uefa Super Cup final offers the remedy and a potential platform for what lies ahead at Stamford Bridge. Liverpool sense opportunity to prolong the new Chelsea manager’s uncomfortable ride.In Jürgen Klopp and his European champions, Lampard faces the highest calibre opponents of his short managerial career at Besiktas Park on Wednesday. Liverpool, who finished 25 points ahead of Maurizio Sarri’s side last season, are a team primed to exploit the gaps and defensive vulnerabilities that contributed to Chelsea’s 4-0 defeat in their Premier League opener at Manchester United on Sunday. The former Derby County manager insisted in Istanbul that the lessons have been learned.“We need to be much better at not committing errors which lead to chances on the counterattack,” he admitted “Because all good teams will make it difficult if you do that.” Liverpool especially.Klopp shares Lampard’s opinion that the scoreline at Old Trafford did not reflect the contest. He also responded with some bemusement to a Turkish journalist who ventured that Liverpool were clear favourites to beat the Europa League winners in a city synonymous with their Champions League successes.“Chelsea are strong, young, fresh and in a really exciting moment with Frank there as a club legend trying to make his own name as a manager,” he said. “Everyone at Chelsea is on their toes. This is the first trophy they can win together. That makes it really interesting. It is a really important game for us.”For Liverpool, their sixth appearance in a Super Cup final is a chance to breed the winning habit after lifting their first trophy under Klopp in Madrid in June and having lost on penalties to Manchester City in the Community Shield.For Chelsea and Lampard, who lost two Super Cup finals as a player with the club, the aims are more prosaic. A performance that does not invite doubts to fester over the club’s enforced reliance on young, homegrown talent would be a welcome reaction to Old Trafford. The bonus of a European trophy in his first competitive week as Chelsea manager would, Lampard believes, have a lasting effect on a new-look team seeking to close the gap on Liverpool and City this season.It was not merely the United result that has complicated Lampard’s first week. He left N’Golo Kanté on the bench at Old Trafford due to an injury-hit pre-season. The influential midfielder came on to try to limit the damage being inflicted only to pick up an ankle problem that makes him doubtful for this match. Added to the transfer ban, the loss of an experienced defender in David Luiz, the team’s most creative talent in Eden Hazard and injuries to Willian plus Antonio Rüdiger, and the Chelsea manager is having to adapt as rapidly to changing circumstances as his players.Lampard concedes: “This week is a good example of that rollercoaster, but I had a year at Derby last season where I had similar rollercoasters. I think that comes with managers’ jobs, particularly at clubs like Chelsea, Liverpool, Man City – all the bigger teams. But I’m very prepared for that. It has been a week where a lot has happened but I was ready for that and I certainly don’t fear that. There are challenges every day in this job.”Klopp’s problems are minor by comparison. He will be without his first-choice goalkeeper Alisson until September with a calf injury and Naby Keïta raised fresh concerns over his fitness on Tuesday when he limped out of the pre-match training session. Istanbul represents “a special place for every Liverpool supporter,” said Klopp but, 14 years on from their fifth Champions League triumph, it is the setting for the six-times winners to show their appetite for silverware is as great as ever.The Liverpool manager said: “We won one competition last year, that’s all, so how could we change our mentality? This team is built for being successful and this final is another chance for us. For me it was important we showed in the Man City game that we were there to win. With a bit of luck in that game we could have won it. It was obvious we wanted to win the trophy and now we have to prove that again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74ad6cb545f5f841b34258bbf3e777032d3ded86/0_234_4160_2496/master/4160.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ef08920aa853f2d92da4793ddd1f8a4","title":"the joy of six football and the outside of the boot","story":"From Brazilian screamers to an extravagant shank via Peruvian insouciance, we celebrate one of football’s most difficult skillsNB: The point of the Joy of Six is not to rank things, only to enjoy themWhen the Joy of Six was growing up, it cherished one VHS more than any other: the Boys from Brazil. That video, which showed Brazil’s World Cup highlights from 1930-86, is the perfect document of a time when jogo bonito was a mantra rather than a slogan. And though we effused about umpteen bits of skill on that tape, nothing captured the visceral brilliance and sheer fantasy of Brazilian football quite like the screamer with the outside of the foot.We’ve mentioned Nelinho in a previous Joy of Six, so let’s move swiftly on to Éder, the luxury left-winger in that glorious 1982 team. In cricket, those who swing the ball prodigiously are said to make the ball talk. When Éder hit it with the outside of the foot, he made it talk like Brian Blessed. At Wembley in 1981 he sent Ray Clemence the wrong way from outside the area, while his free-kick against Argentina at the 1982 World Cup was so spectacular that he is associated with the goal more than the actual scorer, Zico.That free-kick was revelatory to the rest of the world, but not those familiar with Brazilian domestic football. Éder had been doing it for years. In 1978, he scored a quite ludicrous howitzer for Grêmio against Internacional. His run-up was so long, the cameraman had to sweep to the right just to get him in shot. As he did so, commentator Celestino Valenzeula, familiar with Éder’s prowess from 40 yards, delivered an urgent public service announcement: “Atención.”See also (Brazil department):Verón belongs to a select group of players – Dennis Bergkamp and Ricardo Quaresma are others – who have greater control and range with the outside of the foot than most do with the inside. That allows them to curl it both ways and find angles that are beyond other players, something especially valuable when it comes to opening up a defence.Verón was ultimately a failure at Manchester United but he had his moments, and most were orgasmic through balls. Not unlike Paul Pogba, then. Verón’s best was a devastating pass to set up Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s second goal against Deportivo in 2002. The match is famous for David Beckham adding the word metatarsal to the football lexicon. But it’s Verón’s use of the fifth metatarsal that deserves to be remembered.The longer video shows that Seba treated himself to three preparatory touches, all with the outside of his right foot, before flicking a regal pass that took three defenders out of the game and put Solskjaer through on goal. The ball fizzed along the turf with a trajectory and precision usually seen on the bowling green – except this was played at defence-splitting speed.The most brilliant thing about it is the late curve. The more you watch it, the more mystifying it gets. Had it started to straighten any earlier, it would have been intercepted by Héctor any later and it would have pushed Solskjaer too wide. A crack team of air-traffic controllers, with the ability to freeze time, could not have plotted a better path to goal. Verón had a couple of seconds to work it all out, while a series of shapes moved in his peripheral vision – and had to execute it as well. If you can’t see the greatness in that, youse are all effing idiots.See also (through ball department):No Joy of Six on this subject would be complete without a bit of the old ultraviolence – the long-range shot in open play. This is where the World XI comes to Hackney Marshes where the superior technique required to smack the ball with the outside of the foot is combined with the primal screamer we see at every level.Enzo Scifo didn’t actually score against England at Italia 90, but his spectacular shot that slammed off the inside of the post was one of the tournament’s more eye-widening moments. He scored a superb goal with the outside of his foot against Uruguay earlier in the competition, yet that owed most to precision. The effort against England was hit with thumping force. The technique was immaculate, too, his left arm pointing sideways and his body falling slightly to the left like a broken Subbuteo player as the ball detonated off his right foot.In those days, hardly anyone in the old Barclays League Division 1 dared use the outside of the foot to move the ball two yards, never mind scorch it off the post from 30. The World Cup was a portal to a more exotic place. England won the game – you might remember David Platt’s goal – but Scifo captured the imagination.See also (screamer department):Before Scotland’s first match of the 1978 World Cup, one of the travelling press corps told the goalkeeper Alan Rough to watch out for the free-kicks of Peruvian genius Teófilo Cubillas. Rough approached his manager, Ally MacLeod, to ask if there was anything in particular he should know. “Och, forget him lad,” said MacLeod. “He’s nothing special.”You probably know what happened next. Cubillas scored two superb goals, the second a free-kick, to give Peru a stunning 3-1 win over a Scotland side who had been among the favourites. MacLeod really did stretch the philosophy of focusing on yourself rather than the opposition to breaking point. In his defence, no amount of preparation was likely to have done Rough or Scotland much good. Cubillas could use either side of the foot to go to either side of the goal.Yet even by Cubillas’s standards, this was special – and not just because it was on the grandest stage. Thousands of free-kicks have been scored with the outside of the foot, and thousands have been placed delicately into the net from 20 yards in the McAllisterMata style. But we’re struggling to recall many that have combined the two, as Cubillas did with that delicious, insouciant pass into the top corner.Franz Beckenbauer patented a flicked chip with the outside of the foot. Yet Cubillas’s was even better, not least because the free-kick was a fair way left of centre, the wrong side for an outside-of-the-right-footer. It’s a subtly extraordinary piece of skill, one that should have been named after him – if only anybody was good enough to repeat it.See also (insouciance department):Mick Harford and Zinedine Zidane were not entirely similar footballers, but they had a couple of things in common: decisive application of the forehead, and ingenious improvisation with the outside of the foot. Harford’s goal for Luton against Wimbledon in the 1988 FA Cup semi-final, when he briefly turned into Fred Astaire to deal with an awkward bounce, would have received rave reviews had it been scored by a product of La Masia rather than 6ft 3ins of slumbering menace. (In the same game, Dennis Wise became the first man to score with a two-footed tackle on the ball, but we digress.)And then there’s Zidane’s extravagant shank against Bayern Munich. You half expect it to be accompanied by a few sound effects: a clonk here, a parp there. But this is no piece of Soccer AM gold Zidane intended to bring a touch of the Crucible Theatre to the Olympiastadion. The outside of the foot has always been a useful tool for deception, and by the time the four Bayern defenders in close proximity realised what Zidane was up to, the ball was on its way through to Roberto Carlos.Sir Alex Ferguson once said Zidane “does all his fancy tricks without really hurting you”. He looked a bit silly when, a few days later, Zidane’s unfancy passing helped put United out of Europe, but Ferguson was essentially right. Zidane’s productivity in terms of goals and assists was never that great, and he wasn’t much of a Fantasy Footballer. But, as moments like this remind us, he was one of the great fantasy footballers.See also (improvisation department):The outside of the foot should come with a dignity warning. Most daren’t use it, for fear of mistiming the connection and toebunging the ball into another postcode. That risk is even greater when they are expected to score, which is why one-on-one finishes with the outside of the foot are so rare. They require three of football’s most alluring qualities: confidence, nerve and class.Such goals are, by their very nature, often quite ostentatious think Faustino Asprilla at Anfield. This one, from Teddy Sheringham in a long-forgotten 4-2 win over Newcastle in 1994-95, is slightly different. Sheringham had the image of a flash Cockney off the field, yet on it he was a symbol of understated excellence. This goal is typical Sheringham, a mixture of economy, awareness and technique.When Sheringham was at his best there was, as anyone with a passing memory of Euro 96 will attest, a soft, even sensual quality to his play. He couldn’t run as fast as anyone else, so he did everything in his own time. The faster the game got, the more tranquil he seemed. He played elite football with a resting heart rate.It’s no surprise that the most technical English footballer of modern times loved playing with him. “You should,” said Gary Neville, “have heard Scholesy drool about him.” Scholes would have loved to score a goal like this – one that, like most of the good things that are done with the outside of the foot, demonstrated the relaxed certainty of the superior footballer.See also (one-on-one department):"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f746268595682406fa28ff83de9e97dd4955bbb/61_203_1071_643/master/1071.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aad8845f98d5ccacb8770731dd2f8ae2","title":"power stone sega dreamcast fortnite overwatch","story":"Sega’s joyful, rule-breaking gameplay laid the groundwork for today’s multiplayer shooters. Its producer and designer tell us how they did itFrom the very beginning, developers saw the Dreamcast console as a place to experiment. Sega set the tone with innovative outliers such as Shenmue, Jet Set Radio and Seaman, but other game publishers soon caught the wave. There was Acclaim with the odd extreme sports title Trickstyle, developed by the Burnout team there was Interplay with futuristic shooter MDK2, created by Bioware five years before Mass Effect and there was Capcom with its joyful, rule-breaking brawler Power Stone.Set in a boisterous, steampunk-infused universe of pirate ships, taverns and temples, Power Stone was a two-player 3D beat-em-up, in which environmental awareness was as important as punching. There were 10 characters to choose from, most drawn from weird Victorian and Edwardian adventure fiction tropes: pilot explorer Edward Falcon dancer (and ninja) Ayame tank-like miner Gunrock Galuda, a Native American bounty hunter. These were super colourful, erse, problematic, overblown misfits, loaded with backstory – and this was years before Overwatch discovered the value of offering players a roster of funny, interesting weirdos rather than musclebound martial arts assassins.“I was going to go with a modern-day setting to appeal to as many players as possible,” says designer Hideaki Itsuno. “But modern-day technology lacks a certain flair –\u0026nbspthere’s just no romance to it! So I went with the 19th century, before such technology became ubiquitous.” Itsuno was influenced by Jackie Chan and Indiana Jones movies that he’d watched when he was a child. “It seemed to me to be the kind of positive setting anyone could feel excited about.”Unlike most fighting games of the era, the world was viewed from an isometric perspective, with a hyperactive camera that scrolled around, panning in and out of the action. “The game started as a Street Fighter-style side-view fighting game where you would push the stick twice in a direction to move into or out of the screen,” explains producer Takashi Tezuka. “It was only halfway through development that it changed to an overhead view. I remember how great it felt once we’d got the game to a place where it seemed completely different from Street Fighter.”Itsuno was a veteran fighting game developer who had worked on classics such as Street Fighter Alpha, Star Gladiator and Rival Schools. This time he wanted to use his knowledge to create a different sort of combat. “Working on 3D fighting games taught me how to retain the satisfying gameplay of a 2D fighter while providing the freedom of moving in a 3D space,” he says. “But one of my aims with Power Stone was to bring my experience to something that would be well received by players other than just hardcore fighting fans. Fighting games had become incredibly niche, and ordinary gamers were no longer able to keep up.”His idea was to abandon using button combinations to access special attacks. In Power Stone, players would need to know just three moves: punch, kick and jump. Access to powerful abilities would come via objects littered around the elaborate environments – players could throw chairs, tables and rocks, but also pick up weapons such as flame throwers and miniguns that would break after a few seconds of use.This move away from specialist knowledge and abilities and toward making powerful weapons randomly available to all players was an important element of the emerging ‘arena battle’ genre – a forebear of the Battle Royale dynamic. In Power Stone and its close contemporary Super Smash Bros, players enter a match with the same items and abilities and have to search the map for the best stuff all players, no matter how skilful, are at the mercy of the capricious world they’re in. In Power Stone, even a novice can become the most powerful player on the grid if they happen to be standing where a minigun spawns.Itsuno doubled down on this concept through the titular power stone system. Gems appear throughout each bout, and the first player to collect three of them unlocks their character’s special abilities for a limited time, transforming them into super-stylised versions of themselves.It sounds shallow, but it wasn’t. Power Stone was all about dominating the active space and playing the objective (ie chasing after the items and power stones), while learning how to avoid attacks by using environmental barriers. “There aren’t many weapons, and they break, so even if they caused a high amount of damage, they wouldn’t break the game balance,” says Itsuno. “We made the weapons powerful to encourage players to use them a lot. We didn’t want to just add something in on top of the fighting gameplay so much as make items part of the fighting strategy itself.”To get the design just right, Itsuno and Tezuka assembled a team of 30 experienced staff from different areas of the Capcom workforce. “It all started with the idea of developing a game using a team that mixed arcade developers and console developers,” says Itsuno. “We wanted a project that could bring the strengths of both sides – the arcade guys were great at making fighting games and the console guys were expert at creating 3D games. We were trying to be unlike any existing fighting game.”According to Tezuka the development process was fun but challenging. The game was intended for the Matsushita M2, a powerful successor to the 3DO console, which was ultimately axed. Sensing the impending doom, Capcom switched the project to the Dreamcast and Sega’s Naomi arcade board, which were both based on the same technical specifications. “This was Capcom’s first time developing for those platforms, so it was definitely a trial by fire,” says Tezuka. “But creating a new kind of fighting game on brand-new hardware made every day exciting.”Itsuno can reel off features he never got the chance to add, due to the tight development schedule. “There was a Bomberman-esque mode where the only items on the stage were bombs, and you’d slide them around to hit each other,” he recalls. (Later, this made it into the PSP Power Stone Collection.) “There was also a puzzle mode where you had to use boxes and other items to reach the power stone placed craftily on the stage. And a mode where you could play in first-person perspective! If only we’d had another fortnight, maybe we could have packed it all in …”Released into arcades in February 1999 and a few weeks later on Dreamcast, the game was a huge success, thrilling players with its impressive 3D visuals and accessible nature. A sequel followed a year later, and the two games made it onto a PSP collection disc in 2006. There was even an entertaining anime series.“We weren’t just aping current trends or reiterating what had come before, and that has contributed to its lasting appeal,” says Tezuka. “I still get messages from fans about the game. People tweet requests to me to make another Power Stone, which I’d love to do if I got the chance. It would be a particularly great fit for the Nintendo Switch.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56402daa70bb624ff67b1ff07c868c7ac4510552/0_324_5042_3025/master/5042.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56857f7db65f15e08485d419c4c76b32","title":"men said we were immoral aphrodisiacs challenging taboos nigeria","story":"Nigeria’s traditional ‘Kayan Mata’ recipes have grown into a booming industry that’s empowering women to be more open about sexWhen Amra Mansur was working as a makeup artist in Abuja, while she studied law, she would overhear conversations between would-be brides and older relatives about how to please their men in the bedroom.The older, mostly female relatives would recite aphrodisiac recipes that involved ingredients like fenugreek, dates, honey, watermelon and the fruit silky kola.After finishing her studies, Mansur decided she didn’t want to be a lawyer, and the bridal makeup industry was getting too crowded. “I needed to e into something new, and then I thought – why not Kayan Mata?”“Kayan Mata” refers to the aphrodisiacs made of herbs, roots, spices, seeds and fruit that have been used for centuries by women from northern Nigeria. Though they were originally used to prepare brides for marriage, to ensure a healthy sex life, the aphrodisiacs are becoming increasingly popular among all women across the country. Recipes are passed down from generation to generation.“All my ingredients are natural. Honey is one of the ingredients. We have spices like cinnamon, cardamom, mustard seeds, chilli peppers, dates and sugarcane. We have some herbs, roots, powders we get in Nigeria, especially around Zamfara, Gusau and Sokoto,” she says. “These herbs have to come in their natural leafy form, so we see what we are buying.”Not only is Kayan Mata becoming a thriving business, it is challenging the taboos around sex and marriage, and women’s role in society.Many northern women are expected to fulfil the conservative roles of wife and mother. “The image we have is not to be sexual tigresses – we are supposed to be demure,” says journalist Fatima Umar. Speaking about sex openly is not expected of women.“At first, I thought this is going to be so controversial because even though we northern women take it, I wasn’t married at the time,” says Mansur, who added her own family recipes to those gathered during her time making up brides, before opening her business. “It was a taboo for someone who isn’t married to be selling Kayan Mata openly. Even when you are married and selling Kayan Mata, there is this stigma that is attached to it.”Umar remembers the backlash she faced after airing a four-part radio programme she produced and presented.“The backlash was from men who said we were being immoral by giving women a platform to talk about sexuality,” she says. In two of the episodes, women talked about being married to a man who didn’t satisfy them. “To hear a Hausa woman in rural Kano say these things – we thought it was ground-breaking journalism, but it became such an issue that I had to switch off my phone because I was getting all sorts of talk that this is an abomination.”Beyond the backlash, Umar is excited and fascinated by the new wave of Kayan Mata and how it is opening conversations around female pleasure within communities and social groups. “Hopefully in the next 10 to 15 years, we will see more open public conversations.”One myth that needs to be debunked is the mysticism around Kayan Mata that compares it to love potions and charms used by women to bewitch husbands or lure them away from their wives.“Kayan Mata is sex food. That’s what I call them,” says Mansu. “You take this food and they make you wet and sweet. That is just their aim, not to make you bewitch your husband. If you are like that in bed and then he enjoys you, if he does any nice thing afterwards, then that is on him.”Social media platforms like Instagram have been crucial to increasing the popularity of these local aphrodisiacs, giving room for more open conversations around sex and pleasure as well as financially empowering many northern women.Although it’s difficult to put a value on the Kayan Mata market, Umar says: “It is definitely empowering women as they are employing people whom they pay well. There are people back home who source the herbs and have been able to get better opportunities for themselves and families because of this boom.”Hauwa Sule Yaro was three years into running her business when her 17-year-old daughter convinced her to open an Instagram page. Within weeks she says orders started flooding in from places like the US, UK, Istanbul, Cyprus and Dubai. However, she explains that coming from a conservative community still means that she isn’t permitted to discuss sex explicitly on her social media.“A lot of people think talking about sex in public is not a good thing in Nigeria. People look at you as someone who is wayward or irresponsible, so people hide a lot when it comes to sex or using aphrodisiac products.”Much of the history around the use of Kayan Mata centres around men as the principal recipients of sexual pleasure, a myth Mansur is keen to bust.“When I started, all the women were like, ‘Give me something that is going to drive my husband crazy! Give me something that he will enjoy.’ And then they say, ‘I don’t care if I have fun, as long as he does.’”As these requests continued, she believed that women needed a change in mindset and decided to teach them about embracing their own sexual pleasure.“I am so proud of myself because now, I have women who actually enjoy having sex. I have women who have had orgasms and climax because a lot of women didn’t know what orgasms were.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7249d976cdd22d8cd0c55633702c1086737d15d/0_161_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eeaf568043bcf5df7a791aa874b9783","title":"joy despair and determination photographs from kibera","story":"Despite its poverty, Kibera is a vibrant place where people survive in testing conditions, both physical and mental.

We’re already paying the highest ticket prices in Europe to travel on overcrowded and understaffed trains.”The TUC said private train operators paid out £200m in idends to their shareholders in 2017-18 and received £3.8bn in public subsidy. O’Grady said: “It’s time to take the railways back into public hands. Every single penny from every single fare should be invested into our railways.“RPIIn 2013, the retail prices index (RPI) lost its status as a national statistic, as the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the way it calculated prices was likely to overstate the rate of inflation. The treatment of housing costs is also a problem, as RPI uses a combination of mortgage interest payments and house prices as a proxy for housing depreciation. In a period of rapidly rising house prices, inflation accelerates ahead of a basket of goods and services bought by most consumers.CPIAn internationally recognised calculation of inflation, it monitors the rising cost of goods and services according to an agreed formula that statisticians believe is more reliable and robust than that used with RPI. However, CPI also has its detractors because it excludes all housing costs.CPIHThe ONS has included housing costs in its CPI calculation to make CPIH its preferred method of calculating rising prices. It uses rents as a proxy for housing costs. In recent years rents have fallen, especially in London, dragging down the CPIH rate below CPI. But neither the Bank of England nor the Treasury has recognised CPIH as a the standardised measure, leaving it to be largely ignored outside the ONS.\u0026nbspLabour said passengers were “paying more for less” and promised to take the railway back into state ownership as franchises expired.Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said: “It is indefensible and intolerable that many fares may, once again, rise faster than inflation.”But the government defended the planned increase. The rail minister, Chris Heaton-Harris, said: “It’s tempting to suggest fares should never rise. However, the truth is that if we stop investing in our railway then we will never see it improved.”The government has tried to turn the spotlight from rail fares by announcing the award of the West Coast Partnership to a First Group-led consortium with Trenitalia, which will replace Virgin from December. The contract award, which could include the introduction of HS2 high-speed train services from 2026 if the project survives, remains controversial, with the incumbent Stagecoach-Virgin suing the government after being barred from bidding for the franchise again.Bruce Williamson, from the campaign group Railfuture, warned: “It might be that we’ve now reached the point where we cannot simply put fares up and expect passengers to take the hit. They will just give up and refuse to pay. They will either find another job or another form of transport.”The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents private train operators and Network Rail, said 98p in every £1 taken in fares was put back into running the railway. Robert Nisbet, an RDG director, said: “No one wants to pay more to get to work but, by holding rises down to no more than inflation, government is ensuring that money from fares continues to cover almost all of the day-to-day costs of running rail services.”News of the increase comes after a year in which the structure and functioning of the railways has been called into question. Major commuter routes have largely recovered from the chaos of the 2018 summer timetable change, when there were thousands of cancellations and the railway recorded its worst punctuality performance in 18 years, but other problems have persisted.Campaigners and unions staged protests against the fare increases on Wednesday at stations around Britain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7b4ad6defe20556d4caf0d37fad79d628ce84d1/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=630cadf7ba6f1319a12356a55535a265","title":"no deal brexit would be a betrayal says philip hammond","story":"Former chancellor leads group of 20 Tories voicing concernsPhilip Hammond has told Boris Johnson that leaving the EU without a deal would be a betrayal of the referendum result, as the former chancellor led a group of 20 Conservatives making clear their opposition to crashing out on 31 October.In a sign that some Tory MPs are determined to block a no-deal Brexit, Hammond appeared to blame Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s senior adviser, for making demands for a new deal that the EU “cannot and will not accede to”.Writing in the Times, he said: “The hardliners may make the most noise but they are not the most numerous. Most people in this country want to see us leave in a smooth and orderly fashion that will not disrupt lives, cost jobs or diminish living standards, whether they voted leave or remain in 2016. No deal would be a betrayal of the 2016 referendum result. It must not happen.”In an apparent swipe at Cummings, he said: “The unelected people who pull the strings of this government know that this is a demand the EU cannot, and will not, accede to. Not just because they will be stubborn in their defence of the single market (although they will), but because the fragility of their own coalition of 27 means any attempt on their side to reopen the package would see their unity collapse. They will not take that chance and the smart people in Whitehall know it.”A senior Downing Street source said: “Philip Hammond actively undermined the government’s negotiating position by frustrating and obstructing preparation to leave the EU. Everyone knows that the ex-chancellor’s real objective was to cancel the referendum result.”The former chancellor is leading a group of 20 Tories, including seven former cabinet ministers, who have written to Johnson accusing him of setting the bar too high in negotiations with the EU to have a hope of getting changes to a deal.Signed by Greg Clark, David Gauke, Rory Stewart and others, the letter says: “We are alarmed by the ‘red lines’ you have drawn which, on the face of it, appear to eliminate the chance of reaching agreement with the EU”.The intervention is a sign that Tories opposed to a no-deal Brexit are prepared to vote with opposition parties to prevent Johnson taking the UK out of the EU on 31 October without a deal.At the same time, John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, vowed at an Edinburgh festival fringe event to fight attempts to sideline parliament “with every breath in my body”. He said he would insist on the right of parliament to continue to sit and debate.Cummings, the architect of the Vote Leave campaign, has told staff in No 10 that the rebels are too late to stop a no-deal Brexit, as the prime minister could simply push it through on 31 October and hold an election afterwards.However, his opponents are incensed by the idea that parliament could be sidelined and have been working over the summer on ways to prevent that happening. These include a confidence vote to replace Johnson as prime minister with a temporary government or passing a law to force him to extend article 50.Johnson insists that he wants a deal with the EU but only one that does not include the “undemocratic backstop” – the insurance mechanism to stop a hard border on the island of Ireland that Brussels says must be a part of the deal.Since taking office, the prime minster has ramped up preparations for leaving without a deal in a move to convince the EU he is serious about leaving on 31 October regardless of whether the UK has a withdrawal agreement in place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a64e8aa7258520bc7febbe98e2ac5010b962e1f0/0_125_5550_3329/master/5550.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7e46ac194fe3375bdf3cff83f80ffd6","title":"rps 2019 science photographer of the year shortlist","story":"The shortlist for the Royal Photographic Society’s science photographer of the year competition will be exhibited at the Science Museum in London from 7 October until 5 January.

In the first he is belting out the national anthem just before his senior Test debut last Sunday while in the second he is doing the same, four years earlier, at the Junior World Cup in Italy. As fate would have it, Ellis Genge is standing next to him in both and Ludlam accompanied the images with caption: “4 years apart. Aint nothing changed.”It resonates because as Ludlam is only too aware, much has changed in the intervening period. Twelve months ago he was fighting for his career, told by Northampton that he was unlikely to feature in their future plans. Twelve weeks ago he was not due to be part of the England squad to face the Barbarians, only to be added because Teimana Harrison was called away to the birth of his child. Even 12 days ago Ludlam would have featured in few predicted World Cup squads and Eddie Jones is not overstating the flanker’s emergence when he says he came from nowhere.Ludlam has something immediately likeable about him and the video of him singing the national anthem on Sunday has gone viral – as has one of his father doing likewise in the crowd. Underneath the surface, however, there is a steely determination, demonstrated when Chris Boyd arrived at Northampton last summer. Injuries and back-row competition had hindered Ludlam’s development since the 2015 Junior World Cup, where he was named England’s player of the tournament on their run to the final – so much so that he was considering his options and contemplating a move abroad.“This time last year was almost one last shot at it for me, trying to fight for another club contract,” says Ludlam, who as a junior was cut from the Saints academy before forcing his way back in. “Chris Boyd said to me that he could give me an opportunity but he didn’t really see how I fitted into his plans. It’s not easy as a young player. I picked up injuries at the wrong time, which doesn’t help. It’s hard to get into a rhythm and break through.“I couldn’t think of anything I wanted to do other than play rugby. It crossed my mind: what am I going to do post-rugby? I thought that part of last year was trying to play my way into a good highlights reel to get a gig at probably not such a big club or potentially abroad.”Ludlam benefited in part from James Haskell’s injury problems and strung together a series of strong performances in Northampton’s run to the Premiership play-offs. He has played at openside flanker more often than not but Jones sees him primarily as a No 6, which is where he made an impressive debut against Wales – starting with a thumping tackle on Ross Moriarty and continuing in the same vein.“He is uncomplicated, he just wants to be a good rugby player, he wants to work hard,” said Jones. “To me he’s one of those old-fashioned sixes that just does the job. He carries hard, tackles hard, cleans out hard – ‘What do you want me to do, coach, I’ll do it. What does the team need?’ He’s one of those boys. They’re such valuable players.”Ludlam may have been a surprise inclusion but in many ways he exemplifies England’s World Cup squad as one of the young thrusters Jones has turned to and as one of a number of players with multicultural heritage. Ludlam’s father, Arron, has Palestinian and Egyptian roots, his mother, Dorinda, a Guyanese background, and he is evidently proud of his ancestry, equally so of representing England – as his singing would suggest.“Seeing my dad in the crowd gave me goosebumps, gave that extra little bit of something,” he says. “To see him belting it out made me want to sing it that little bit louder.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/324bf36b233e378b3d560490dcd94ce0cad5bd29/0_112_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23eb5291f4a18ef863ac67d5a7a55076","title":"ashes 2019 england v australia second test day one live","story":"“I think cricket’s use of language adds to the charm,” writes Dave Adams. “I love the Australian use of ‘ordinary’, which is similar to when you hear commentators say a batsman averaging 7.9 in a series is ‘pretty moderate’ when they actually mean ‘dismal’, ‘shocking’, or just ‘shit’. There’s a fine line between cowardly and diplomatic, and I guess it’s difficult to be too harsh on a player as a journalist if you’re reliant on them being willing to give you an interview at some point. By the way - forecast says it’s going to stop raining (properly this time) in 53 minutes...”I’ll believe it when I see it.“I used to have a knack of coming to Ashes Tests on wet days,” writes Tim Sanders. “The Friday at Lords in 1977 was the last rain in England for 3 months. The Sunday at Headingley in 2001 had just enough play to avoid refunds, and led to Gilchrist’s bold declaration. The Saturday at Old Trafford in 2005 gave me a treasured memory of my late father-in-law, as he sat alone in the stand attempting the crossword as the Yorkshire Post turned to papier mâché in his hands.  “So when my son and I made our way to Trent Bridge on a cloudy Thursday morning in 2015, I was pessimistic. However, that day turned out OK for most of those present. I’m convinced that it was Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow’s batting that made the sun come out that afternoon.”“I can’t wait to see how you keep yourself entertained over four days of rain at Old Trafford. I think we might see the emergence of ‘Canal Walking With Geoff Lemon’ as an OBO highlight.”Bring me a raincoat will you, Grif? I’ll need a local one. The rain came back, if you hadn’t guessed. It’s really just a matter of when we call it off now, though a decent wedge of crowd remains under the roofs. May as well be here as anywhere, I suppose? If you want something else to do while we wait, have a listen to Our Emma and her Spin podcast.“‘Not clever’ doesn’t make much sense, I agree. But the Australian use of ‘ordinary’ is not particularly ordinary.”That is true. It’s an ongoing legacy of cowardly language, where we use euphemisms until they lose their meaning. So if something is reasonably acceptable, you can’t call it average or mediocre or ordinary. A rating of 7 out of 10 is seen as a condemnation. Superlatives are wasted like water down the storm drains. “I am having a disturbing vision involving a lemon-yellow Australia shirt slithering off David Boon’s broad and hairy chest before he reaches for a squiggly-writing “laaaaaaady’s” shirt, saying “Don’t judge me” as Jonny Bairstow looks at him askance, moodily handling a pair of purple sparkly balls. The rain means I might now get to bed this evening here in Australia but that vision has now ruined any chance I have of sleep. Cheers, Geoff.”Jane Evans, that sounds more like a dream to me. Jump straight in the middle of that situation. A melange of eras, a meld of minds. Adventures on the astral plane beat commutes on the bus. I think it has stopped raining in the most immediate sense, because the ground staff are out there sweeping water to the edges of the covers, but I’m sure it will start again soon enough. Thanks to David Peacock for unearthing the Brendan Taylor report. I assume it was a dealership promotion where you get one Zimbabwe player for free with each purchase. “There’s nearly always live sport at Lord’s if you know where to look,” writes Michael Keane. “Having done the shop, if you you get really desperate you can pop in to the real tennis court. Spare a thought for the players though - the roof has had a leak for quite a few weeks and that floor gets slippy.”I will be in there within the hour, I reckon.Alastair Ferguson is the fastest gun in the West.If someone can send me the TMS overseas link, I’ll disseminate it more widely. Better yet, tell me where to find it on an ongoing basis.“The best rain delay I experienced was at a one-day cup semi final between Notts and Durham at the Home of Cricket (Trent Bridge),” writes Daniel Dalby. “My friend and I met Paul Collingwood and Samit Patel (a true cricket legend) early doors. Due to certain contacts that I wouldn’t like to incriminate we had a half-price bar for the day. The heavens opened from 3 until 7, and the match was reduced to 20 overs a side. Samit Patel ripped through the Durham top order and smashed the ball to all corners. My friend was seen on local news, dancing to celebrate a six behind a very serious Mick Newell interview. I think the Notts players had a similar time, based on us seeing them in a bar later in the day and Brendan Taylor waking up the following morning in a stranger’s car in West Bridgeford.”Ryan Loonan went to quite some lengths to watch Lancashire play in a T20 quarter-final at Old Trafford.“I arrived on Friday, it rained, it rained a bit more, and we were told to return the next day to do it all over again. Saturday came and rain was in the air. The game started at 14:00 and stopped 4 or 5 times, each one a swift shower followed by a 45-minute mopping up job. The thousand or so people in the ground got pretty efficient in their exits from the stands. There were a couple of games of varying quality against the bins under the stands. Every time we thought we were getting somewhere, more rain would come, and people were trying to find ball by ball DLS targets. At around 7pm, two days culminated in Glamorgan needing 15 runs to win off the final over. They scored 13 and Lancs won the day.”Back in the day TMS was always at its best in the rain,” emails JP. “Burbling was happily raised into art. Reminiscence was especially purple and dewy-eyed and often rheumy-eyed. Titans of the past had a weather-fuelled space and soapbox in which to ferociously berate every misguided venture and sin of modernity and it’s younger denizens. Gluttony abounded, and tippling too apparently. It was always something of a disappointment when the clouds parted and the (much less interesting) game could recommence.”I rather enjoy the rain blogs more than the play blogs sometimes, if we’re honest. More of a stroll, less of a beep-test sprint foreshadowing arthritis. I can pop upstairs and see how much tippling is going on in the TMS box. They do have a fair few magnums of champagne floating about for one of their awards. “Whilst your piece about the umbrellas was almost poetic,” writes Alistair M, “I do wonder how many such pieces you can come up with for the rest of the day. When do you get to quit and do something else? Our cat isn’t letting persistent, almost torrential rain prevent her from sitting in next door’s garden. Clearly a better option than a house.”Almost poetic. That’s a review I would have accepted gladly when I wrote poetry. Never try to understand cats, anyone. You know that by now. As for the opening question, I will be here writing almost poetry until play is called off or until Rob Smyth carries my cold rigid husk out to the bonfire.“The 113 was the bus we took from home in Cricklewood during my 8 years of London life,” writes Paul Blundell. “It was only for going to Lord’s for whatever game was most interesting that summer that our backpacker’s budget could allow.My overwhelming memory is it raining every time...”Surely Mr Seaman should be able to handle some wet weather?Raymond Reardon has some helpful advice for us all. “The internet site for St John’s Wood needs updating as it currently states that sunrise was supposed to be 5.45am. Also Geoff, if you are delayed at the liquid mood enhancer parlour today, also note that the last 113 bus today leaves at 0.38am Thursday.” I’m going to be sleeping under the desk, aren’t I?Dave Adams has sent me a screenshot of the radar. “This doesn’t look too clever, but it’s moving slowly eastwards. Play by 14:30 is my super-optimistic shout...”It’s interesting, the English use of ‘not clever’ for something just being not good. Especially inanimate things or events or situations. It confuses my brain a bit because my understanding of cleverness involves intent. This is your linguistic thought for the day.And that’s it. Your exciting tour through the Lord’s shop.

But Waller-Bridge, who is taking the play into the West End for her final run in the role, had spent years honing her craft. Fleabag was the fruit of a long-running short-play night she established in 2007 with her writing partner Vicky Jones. It shared the name of the theatre company, DryWrite, which they still co-run. The pair cut their teeth there without any critics to clock it. The backstory to their success has, so far, gone untold.At the time, London had quite a few similar nights, all breeding grounds for emerging talent. But DryWrite’s was different – “the least formal, the most rough round the edges and the most punky”, remembers playwright Phil Porter. They were as much about socialising as scriptwriting, and they certainly weren’t showcases. With no industry invites, people made work for their peers – mostly for the hell of it. “It felt like you were part of this great gang,” says The Pass writer John Donnelly. “They felt like the coolest nights in town.”DryWrite started off at the George Tavern in Shadwell, a rundown old boozer (since renovated). The stairs were rickety, the ceiling threatened collapse and, on one occasion, artists arrived to find a dead owl on the stage.“It was like a Who’s Who of the great and the good of British theatre today,” says playwright Tim Price. You might find shorts by James Graham, Ella Hickson, Lucy Kirkwood or Jack Thorne being performed by Arthur Darvill, Michelle Terry or Daniel Rigby – and, of course, Waller-Bridge herself.Not that you’d know. DryWrite’s distinguishing feature was anonymity, partly allowing Waller-Bridge to write undercover. “For a community of people all desperately trying to make a name for themselves, that was an interesting provocation,” Price reckons. It gave writers freedom to take genuine risks, from saying the unsayable to toying with form.What really set DryWrite apart, however, was that it started to set writers tasks. They weren’t scratch nights, or rapid responses to a subject or theme. The starting points were more active and open-ended: playwriting challenges. For instance, “Funny, Not Funny?” charged writers with toeing the tightrope of taste or tragedy. At what point, it wondered, would the laughter dry up? “What’s in My Box?” was an exercise in intrigue, giving characters containers they couldn’t open – safes, coffins, inboxes, flight recorders. “Guilty?” took horrific real-life crimes – stolen newborns, sex slavery – and had culprits attempt to justify their actions. Other challenges asked writers to pen lyrics that would be set to song and to cook up extended, extravagant fight sequences.Most nights involved audience interaction. One secret mission set writers out to solicit a heckle, birthing the first incarnation of Fleabag as Waller-Bridge wrote about a woman dumping her boyfriend for someone who was simply much better in bed. Another split the audience according to gender. “The provocation was immediately dangerous,” says Donnelly. “What do I with this? Do I lean into it or do I back away? It gave you a genuine problem.”Price remembers: “Vicky and Phoebe would spend days and days honing a stimulus for their writers.” “They wrestled with ways to create maximum drama.” That put writers to the test. How do you control an audience’s laughter? How do you hook them in or rile them up? DryWrite was always more interested in effect than expression, encouraging dramatists to do something to their audience: shock them, surprise them, elicit a response.“It was entirely about entertaining the people in the room,” Donnelly says. “Most of the stuff was pretty ropey, but occasionally something magic would happen.” Someone would hit a rich theatrical seam – and scratchy memories of the time seem to reflect that. People recall images, rather than entire scripts: Darvill with his hand stuck in a vase, reaching for a ringing phone, or Terry winning a crowd round as a grieving mother who had murdered someone else’s child. Fighting nuns. Co-workers scrapping with shredders and staplers. A family argument, except everyone’s dressed as animals. “Seeing a penguin screaming at a donkey, that was special,” says Price with a chuckle.Inevitably, it grew competitive, and giddiness was par for the course. Jonjo O’Neill remembers “a champagne feeling – more cava, I suppose. It was a very bubbly atmosphere. There was always a sense of being close to corpsing.” The point, he says, is that people were writing and playing for each other, not to impress industry types or bag a commission. “It was all very un-Rada, the opposite of taking yourself seriously in a Chekhov. There was a real sense of community – like a secret theatre club.”At the heart of that were Waller-Bridge and Jones – infectious personalities who set the evening’s tone. If the duo defined DryWrite’s spirit, the club left its mark on them. Waller-Bridge’s writing still bears its hallmarks – teetering on the edge of taste and relishing moral ambivalence. You could trace Fleabag’s direct address back there, or Killing Eve’s delight in overblown action sequences. Two protagonists that do unconscionable things and retain our sympathies regardless? That’s pure DryWrite."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1f1d84ab5ed8ee663e0458f28577302910a75b8/0_0_3199_1919/master/3199.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e241f6efb5ec09d91d01a8a6d07365f2","title":"teen smart fridge twitter grounded","story":"Fifteen-year-old resorts to drastic measures after action taken ‘so I’d pay more attention to my surroundings’A resourceful teenager has taken the rise of increasingly powerful smart home devices to its logical conclusion – tweeting from her family’s smart fridge after her mother confiscated her phone.The 15-year-old Ariana Grande fan known only as “Dorothy” was barred from using her phone but managed to find a number of innovative ways to reach her thousands of followers – a handheld Nintendo device, a Wii U gaming console, and finally, her family’s LG Smart Refrigerator.Dorothy, who declined to share her last name, says her mother disciplined her two weeks ago after she got too distracted while cooking and caused a fire.“She took all my tech so I’d pay more attention to my surroundings,” said the teen, who messaged the  from her cousin’s iPad because she was still facing a tech ban. “I felt mortified! I was worried because I’ve been bored all summer and Twitter passes the time for me.”The user was worried about losing her “mutuals” – accounts she follows that follow her back – and devised other ways to get tweets out. Her self-described “fan account” is used primarily to send tweets about Ariana Grande.Dorothy then sent a tweet saying: “my mom took my phone and my nintendo ds so i have no choice but to use my wii … thank u all for the support and love.” The tweet’s source label, which indicates the device from which a tweet was sent, confirmed that the tweet came from a Wii U.Finally, after her mother apparently took her Wii U away as well, she sent a tweet from her LG Smart refrigerator: “I’m talking to my fridge what the heck,” she said.LG did not respond to request for comment, but its website confirms the refrigerator does have social media capabilities, and the tweet source confirms it was sent from the device.After the saga went viral, with more than 12,000 retweets, Twitter itself stepped in and joined the calls for Dorothy to be returned to the internet, tweeting #FreeDorothy.Dorothy did not answer questions regarding how long she will be grounded. “I may be late to reply, as it is difficult to find something to use Twitter,” she told the ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/833edc16435de60d406f1a7367fc5f25b02be4c9/0_205_6016_3608/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2eec257a2b3ea255833e8a11875b9221","title":"mix it up the mixologists guide to drinking rum","story":"Still drinking gin? Update your drinking habits with tips from the experts on enjoying rum’s craft revivalWhile gin has had a dramatic rise in popularity over the past five years, bartenders have been quietly getting excited about rum. It offers huge cocktail variety, depending on the style from the unaged white variety to those aged in the tropics, it’s as complex and nuanced as any other spirit. I spoke to some top mixologists about their favourite cocktails.Jack Wallis and Chris Tanner at the VaultRum cocktails range from the super-simple to concoctions worthy of Michelin stars. Jack Wallis, operations manager at the Vault in Soho, is proud of the simplicity of their Captain’s Blood – a twist on a daiquiri, made with rum, fresh lime, sugar syrup and bitters that’s perfect to serve at home. For something a little more complex, Chris Tanner, also of the Vault, makes a version of Planter’s Punch with orange, pineapple, lime juice, grenadine, sugar syrup and Lugger Rum. Unlike some varieties, Lugger Rum is not dominated by vanilla, aiming instead to deliver a full profile of spices, including nutmeg, orange peel and cloves.Liam Cotter of Heads, Hearts and TailsBarman Liam Cotter, of events and consultancy firm Heads, Hearts and Tails, warns not to take shortcuts in rum-based cocktails: “Inexperienced bartenders may swap out a quality rum with an inferior one and wonder why their grog isn’t quite the same.” Cotter’s all-time favourite cocktail is a Jungle Bird not the original 1970s version, created in the Kuala Lumpur Hilton, but the reimagined New York classic, created by way of Giuseppe Gonzales (formerly of New York’s Suffolk Arms and long-standing patron of Milk \u0026amp Honey). He reworked it to become infinitely more balanced and appealing to a refined contemporary palate. It’s part all-night-fun negroni, part complex bitter daiquiri. He thinks this would be great with Lugger Rum.He also has a soft spot for something more straightforward: “There is something lovely about a simple rum and coke.”Mia Johansson at SwiftLondon bar Swift is known for its elegant and inventive cocktails, and one of managing partner Mia Johansson’s favourites is a Praline Flip. First, they make their own hazelnut orgeat – by heating the nuts in water, cooling and re-blending them – then combine with Angostura bitters, egg, Guinness and spiced rum. Their second cocktail is a little less complicated, but still one I wouldn’t try at home. It’s an espresso martini using Mr Black cold-brew coffee liqueur, coffee, vodka, rich demerara sugar and spiced rum.Thom Solberg at Black RockBlack Rock’s bar manager Thom Solberg loves a Mai Tai. Although this award-winning Shoreditch bar primarily focuses on whisky, it also works with rum. Solberg’s take on his retro favourite uses three rums – Jamaican, Lugger spiced and over-proof – along with triple sec and lime juice. All it needs is shaking up, pouring over ice and a garnish of orange and mint. He says spiced rum goes well with anything apple-y, and that a particular favourite rum modifier is pomegranate molasses. He incorporates this mix into a rum punch alongside dry cider, lime, allspice dram and a little vanilla syrup, garnished with cinnamon, nutmeg and apple slices.Kurt Maitland, cocktail authorKurt Maitland, author of Drink, can recommend something simple and something more showy. A Devil’s Kiss won’t tax you: shake up equal parts coffee liqueur, Grand Marnier and Lugger Rum with ice and strain into small glasses.The Kama’aina is a completely different kettle of fish, however. It starts with ginger syrup, almond paste and pimento liqueur, stirred to create a #9. Next add Rhum agricole, Lugger Rum, guava nectar, real cream of coconut, and fresh lime then shake with crushed ice and strain into a tiki glass, adding Angostura bitters and an orange blossom garnish at the end. Maitland describes a Devil’s Kiss as like an aperitif at home before the main drama of a complicated Kama’aina in a specialist bar. The former can easily be made in quantity for parties and the spiced rum balances beautifully with the bitter coffee and sweet Grand Marnier.Featuring fruit, spice and a genuinely fiery twist – careful with those matchesLugger rum 50mlStrawberry and lime syrup 20ml*Angostura bitters, 2 dashesWest country cider 30mlSprig of rosemarySpiced powder**MatchesStrawSugar 50gStrawberries x10Peeled lime skins (x2 whole limes)Juice of 1 whole limeIn a bowl, muddle all ingredients and leave for 10-30 minutes in fridge, then strain through a sieve.Mix equal parts of icing sugar, cinnamon powder and nutmeg powder.Lugger Rum is a Caribbean rum aged in Devon, featuring sophisticated notes of orange peel, nutmeg, cloves and vanilla.

Workers shovelling snow from the line in winter would traditionally stay in these low-slung stone huts at the end of their shift. Now upgraded for high-spec, studio-style, open-plan living, the first hut has exposed brickwork and beams, under-floor heating, slate floors, reclaimed teak furniture, an L-shaped leather sofa and a woodburner.

Now, with the help of Tiffany Haddish, a new Netflix show is bigging up black voices at lastIn 2017, Tiffany Haddish, the breakout star of Girls Trip, told the  that she has never wanted to “steal the show”. “I’m not a thief. Where I come from, you don’t call someone that.”This week, Haddish is going to practise what she preaches, handing the mic over to six comedians she thinks deserve our time. The stars subvert the male, pale and stale status quo: they are mainly women of colour, and also represent queer, trans and working-class identities. The show undoubtedly breaks new ground in representation in comedy.Haddish, who turned her hand to the art of laughter when she went into foster care aged 12, has described her candid style of comedy as a “safe space” to discuss adversity. She lived in her car while trying to land work in her 20s, then shot to fame after giving it her all in Girls Trip. Now, They Ready on Netflix will pass the baton to other comedians who have been sidelined by history.The show also fits into a rapidly changing comedy climate, which is more erse than it ever has been. In 2011, Shappi Khorsandi joked that she was probably the “only female Iranian comedian” – but since then, dozens more women of colour have sprung on to the scene and become household names. HBO’s Insecure blew the stage wide open for black women comics in 2016, while women of colour-fronted podcasts such as 2 Dope Queens have become mainstays of the morning commute, and standups such as Ali Wong have seen their shows go stratospheric on Netflix. But what is responsible for the boom? Historically, comedy has always been a boys’ club in which women of colour have faced lazy stereotyping and struggled to demonstrate demand for their work to white bookers. So what has sparked the change?On the come-up, the biggest issue for Tracey Ashley, one of They Ready’s comedians, was stereotyping. When she was first scouted by Louis Lee of Acme comedy club, she says Lee told her: “You’re star quality, but it’s going to be hard. You don’t fit the stereotype of what a black female comedian should be.” He was right. “Everywhere I went, people thought I was gonna get on stage, shuck and jive, and be loud,” says Ashley.Meanwhile, both Chaunté Wayans and Flame Monroe, who will also take to Haddish’s stage on Netflix, say that being LGBT+ presented additional challenges on the comedy scene. As a self-described lesbian stud, Wayans says people often tried to make her into something she wasn’t. “People would ask me to show my breasts more, to look the way I felt the most uncomfortable. I was like: ‘I’m funny! You haven’t even seen my set yet!’”Monroe adds that being black and trans, it was common to be outright ignored. “I worked in comedy for 10 years before men – some women as well – would even acknowledge me in the green room,” she says.The presence of black women specifically was also highly controlled by the bookers. Ashley says: “You could go to a club and look at their calendar for the year, you wouldn’t see two women of colour ... they kept us separate.”In the UK, the British and African-Indian standup Athena Kugblenu has run into the same problems. “I still never see the other black women on the circuit, because people won’t book more than one black woman a night.”“The biggest challenge is still getting people to see us as iniduals, not a genre. ‘Black female’ is not a genre of comedy.”That’s not to say comedians themselves don’t fall into the trap of feeling that race is their only selling point. The Afro-Latinx comedian Aida Rodriguez, who also stars in They Ready, thinks this mindset used to influence lots of performers of colour. “When I started doing standup there was a lot more ide and conquer,” she says. “This idea that there can only be one person of colour at the top – even though the Seinfelds, the Louis CKs, the Jim Gaffigans and the Jay Lenos didn’t have to operate like that.”Ashley echoes this: “When I was coming up on the road by myself, they would pit women against each other. I would tell other women: ‘Y’all realise if we come together, we can do some groundbreaking things?’”Over time, a strong culture of solidarity has built up, which has played a big part in the industry shakeup. The premise of They Ready is Haddish using her platform to spotlight other marginalised comedians – but this tradition has a history.Rodriguez met Haddish five years ago at a standup competition: “She came up to me and said: ‘I’ve heard about you, now I see why. You’re so pretty, and I want to be your friend.’ It was just like being on the playground when you’re five. It was that pure, and that sweet.”From giving her tips (such as stop offering your labour for free) to FaceTiming her on dark Chicago walks home to make sure she stayed safe, Haddish helped Rodriguez out however she could. “She would call me in the mornings when I was taking my babies to school and give me a word of encouragement, because she knew I would be tired.”The two made a pact “that whoever made it first would throw the rope back – and she made it first.”Ashley agrees that getting gigs is still mainly about who you know, which makes it all the more important for women of colour to help each other up when they find success. “Friends get people in – recommendations and stamps of approval,” she says.She remembers what Viola Davis said when she won her Emmy in 2015: “The only thing that separates women of colour from anyone else is opportunity.”Like most creative industries, much of the change in the comedy landscape undoubtedly has to do with the internet. Pointing to social media comics such as Judy Love, Kugblenu says: “Once you prove you’ve got that online audience, that’s when the mainstream starts to pay attention. At that point you’re undeniable – people can’t make excuses about what you do being ‘niche’.”The internet allowed women to create comedy in spaces they could control. Kugblenu says that when she was starting out, most open-mics would take place in pubs and bars, which felt alienating. “They’re very white, male spaces.”Like Judy Love, Chescaleigh Ramsey found an audience on YouTube, publishing homemade listicle-style skit videos. In a similar vein, podcasts such as 2 Dope Queens and the spinoff Sooo Many White Guys landed their stars an HBO special.For many, Insecure, Issa Rae’s hit web series-turned-TV show, was a turning point for television. Ashley says: “When that show came out, I was so excited. Issa Rae found her lane online.”Regardless of budget, as views, clicks and downloads racked up for women of colour online, it became obvious there was a huge appetite for it. Ashley jokes: “I finally get here, and now they’re just laying it all out. There are women of colour all over television – who just popped out.”For women of colour, it seems the scene has changed unrecognisably. As well as networking more widely – with people of colour collectives such as FOC It Up coming together – more women of colour getting recognised means more ersity in how they are portrayed in comedy. “In the past it was all stereotypes,” says Rodriguez. “But now people are speaking about politics, social issues. It’s not just comedians going on stage and giving people what they’re accustomed to seeing.”And the more representation there is, the easier it is for others starting out. Monroe points to the prominence of other black trans people like her in the media: “With women like Laverne Cox and Janet Mock, it has helped. Hopefully I’ve kicked the doors open for transgender comedians coming behind me, so now they don’t have to show up and make excuses for who they are all they have to do is show up and be funny.”The natural next step, it seems, is for those in positions of power to give a platform to others who struggle to get on the scene – whether that’s due to racism, classism, homophobia or transphobia. Ashley agrees: “I’m hoping that what Tiffany did will open the eyes of a lot of people, because that’s what you’re supposed to do. This is the only way to move us all forward.”Nonetheless, she already believes things have changed for good. “For a long time, we all wanted to be in the boys’ club,” she says. “That was the only place there was. But now, that’s been obliterated. That is gone now.”• They Ready is on Netflix now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c0e7cd34e4b48f9024bd6affb1a07ebe4561d83/0_197_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3dd1e9ce9b40fa7884b4e2e39520bf6","title":"ceo worker pay gap","story":"Chief executives at the US’s top companies took home $17.2m in pay last year – 278 times the salary of their average worker.The analysis comes as some of the US’s richest businessmen have publicly worried about growing income inequality.This year, Ray Dalio, billionaire founder of Bridgewater, the world’s biggest hedge fund, warned that the gap between rich and poor in the US was becoming a “national emergency”. JP Morgan’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, has called for a “Marshall plan” to address a “systemic problem” that had left half of society “severely disadvantaged”.Lawrence Mishel, EPI distinguished fellow, said there was a direct correlation between the outsized pay gains made by CEOs and the stagnant wages of their workforce given that there was little evidence linking the turbocharged growth in their wages and the performance of their companies.“You could cut CEO pay in half and the economy would not be any different,” he said.Average CEO pay peaked at $21.5m (in 2018 dollars) in 2000, the height of the late-1990s tech-driven stock market bubble, and it fell after the bubble burst. It had recovered again by 2007 only to dip again in 2008 and 2009 as the last recession took hold. Their compensation has been growing steadily ever since.Over the long term, the gap between the average worker at one of the US’s top companies and their boss has widened dramatically. In 1965, the average CEO earned 20 times as much as the average worker at one of the US’s top 350 companies. By 1978, the ratio was 30-1. By 1991, it was 121-1.While some shareholders and corporate governance groups have targeted executives at companies they believe are overpaid, Mishel said the easiest way to address the gap was to substantially increase taxes on top earners.“It’s hard to do this one CEO at a time,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e5d6917fc1e6aeefd46bc6c7db22c8f88397775/0_313_4695_2817/master/4695.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee7f9fa154925b2b0df1489fb9e9f3a1","title":"small is beautiful in tokyo golden gai in pictures","story":"Nearly 300 bars and restaurants are squeezed into an area about the size of half a football pitch in the Golden Gai area of Tokyo.

Photograph: Ben StansallAFPGetty ImagesGreta Thunberg, the 16-year-old climate activist, climbed nimbly aboard the Malizia II, the racing yacht that will set sail on Wednesday afternoon whenever the wind is right and take her across the Atlantic to New York. The journey is expected to take two weeks. The sea is likely to be rough at times.Thunberg is making this epic voyage because she has been invited to participate at the United Nations climate talks in September, and she refuses to fly because aviation has such an enormous carbon footprint. And so, on a Tuesday morning, under grey skies, here she was, aboard a sleek racing machine that had made many journeys across the ocean, but never with a 16-year-old novice. The boat was fitted with solar panels to power its equipment. The conditions inside were spartan: There is no toilet nor much light in the cabin, so she will have to read by headlamp. In a particularly acute challenge for a teenager with 871,000 Twitter followers, she will not have much access to the internet.Thunberg has never done anything like this before. She said she was looking forward to being without the familiar luxuries, to “being so limited”. She acknowledged being a bit nervous. “Whether its seasickness or homesickness or just anxiety or I don’t know,” she said. “I don’t know how tough this journey will be.”Also, she said, she will really miss her two dogs. She has packed many books (she is currently reading Quiet, a book about introverts, like her) eight writing journals, some partly filled and boxes of freeze-dried vegan meals (Thunberg stopped eating meat a few years ago, because of the emissions associated with animal protein).There is a satellite phone on board, so she plans to send some pictures and text messages from her voyage to friends who will upload them on her social media accounts. Going to the toilet will mean going to the back of the boat with a bucket. Her drinking water will come from a tiny desalination machine that treats seawater.“By doing this it also shows how impossible it is today to live sustainable,” she said. “That, in order to travel with zero emissions, that we have to sail like this across the Atlantic Ocean.”  School strikesThe voyage of the Malizia II is the latest stage in an epic journey that Thunberg has been on for the last few years. As a child, doctors told her she had Asperger syndrome. In early adolescence she battled severe depression, so much so that she stopped eating for a while and stopped growing.Recovery came slowly, and only after finding a sense of purpose. “I’ve had my fair share of depressions, alienation, anxiety and disorders,” she wrote in a recent Facebook post. “But without my diagnosis, I would never have started school striking. Because then I would have been like everyone else.”Her weekly school strikes began in Stockholm, her home city, a year ago. They sparked a global youth movement to demand climate action and then turned her into something of a modern-day Cassandra, a target of praise and pointed attacks. In March came a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize. António Guterres, the UN secretary-general, said he trusted young activists like her to “push societies to save our planet”. This week, Steve Milloy, a former member of the Trump transition team, described her on Twitter as “the ignorant teenage climate puppet”.Thunberg on Tuesday shrugged off the attacks. “They are doing everything they can to switch the focus from the climate crisis to me,” she said. “That is what you have to expect when you talk about these things.”  Thunberg is taking the year off school. She is scheduled to attend the UN climate summit talks next month, speaking at a youth summit on September 21st and then at the main meeting on September 23rd. She also plans to travel to Chile for the next round of UN-sponsored climate talks December.Both meetings are to be attended by world leaders, all of whom have agreed, under the Paris climate accord, to keep global temperatures from rising to levels that would produce climate catastrophes. Still, global emissions continue to grow, and the world as a whole is not on track to meet the targets of the Paris agreement.“This is a big opportunity for those world leaders who say they’ve been listening to us to actually show that they’ve been listening to us, to actually prove that,” Thunberg said. Rain and darknessThe voyage has drawn enormous media attention. Thunberg gave four face-to-face interviews Tuesday, spoke to other reporters on the phone in between, and greeted a few youth strikers who had come to Plymouth from elsewhere in Britain before heading into an emergency training session.There were many handlers and helpers. And there was Greta swag. One woman moving chairs for her well-wishers wore a sweatshirt that hollered, “Be Like Greta”. Thunberg, for her part, wore a red hoodie and lilac sweatpants with a hole at the knee.Boris Hermann, the 38-year-old German captain, said he had crossed the Atlantic many times. In fact, he has sailed around the world in this yacht, finding routes where the wind was in his back, steering it through rain and darkness. This trip, though, would be different. “I feel a special responsibility also because it’s an important trip for Greta and we promised to bring her over,” he said. “I admire her leadership.” The captain said he would try to take a southerly route to the United States to avoid the strongest headwinds, to find what he called the “softest” variations. If the wind is calm, it could be smooth sailing and his passengers would be able to relax and read. Or, there could be gusts of wind and rain.There are two beds for Thunberg and her father, Svante, who is accompanying her. The others on the voyage – Hermann, the skipper Pierre Casiraghi, the head of the Malizia II racing team and a documentary filmmaker named Nathan Grossman – plan to sleep on beanbags. The boat has a motor and generator in the event of an emergency. The slogan on the mainsail was chosen by Thunberg. “Unite Behind the Science,” it reads. Thunberg will be close to Hermann’s age in 2040, which is when, scientists say, climate catastrophes could strike the world unless we move swiftly away from a fossil fuel based economy. “I have no idea how the world is going to look,” she said. Either the world will have tackled the problem in time, she went on, or it will have crossed what scientists call “tipping points”, beyond which it’s impossible to return to normal weather patterns.“I can’t really start planning my future,” she said.  That profound uncertainty animates the activism of many people of her generation. It explains, in large part, why she is taking this voyage across the ocean – and why, for the voyage, she wants to focus on the basics. “My goal is to feel as good as possible during the trip,” she said. – New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Thousands of prospective students who applied for third-level courses will receive offers this weekBeaches were shut on Friday following a wastewater overflow at the plant in RingsendGrants for deep retrofits to be given only to projects already approvedHighly critical review was completed in May 2016 but findings were never made publicHSE chief warns over 1,000 people are carrying most dangerous superbug CPELack of sunshine to blame for vitamin D deficiency and incidence of osteoporosisUS vice president is expected to arrive in Dublin on September 6th for a two-day visitAugust 14th 1969: Drawing on contemporaneous reports, Donnacha \u0026Oacute Beach\u0026aacutein describes the day\u0026rsquos events as they unfoldedApplication for licence paves way for Civil Defence to provide medical services at eventsHard-Brexit Tory MPs claim even a backstop abolition insufficient to avert no-deal exitLocal boats assist in rescue as almost a dozen taken to hospital after getting into difficultyAn Taisce has lodged an objection to the EPA\u0026rsquos intention to reissue licence to operateApprentice Boys recognise \u0026lsquoupset\u0026rsquo caused by Parachute Regiment emblems at Derry paradeFewer than 40 sat Leaving Cert papers in July under pilot scheme for bereaved pupilsHurling for Cancer Research brings more than 6,000 fans to St Conleth\u0026rsquos Park"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3985437.1565726194!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"condolences offered to quoirins over every family s worst nightmare","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresident of Ireland Michael D Higgins has offered condolences to the family of Nóra Quoirin.

Mr Johnson, the new British prime minister, has said the backstop, the insurance policy to avoid a hard border, must be abolished if there is to be an orderly Brexit at the end of October. The EU is adamant that the current withdrawal agreement, which contains the backstop, will not be reopened or renegotiated. Stephen Barclay, the UK Brexit secretary, laid out Mr Johnson’s position in a phone call with EU agriculture commissioner Phil Hogan earlier this week. However, Mr Hogan indicated to Mr Barclay that the EU is aware that members of the so-called European Research Group of hard-Brexit Tory MPs have already said the abolition of the backstop is not enough. Mr Hogan repeated that the backstop would not be changed and challenged Mr Barclay to come up with some ideas to break the current impasse.After the phone call, Mr Barclay said: “We’re leaving the EU on October 31st with or without a deal.” He added that he stressed to Mr Hogan that “while we’re ready to energetically enter into new negotiations in a spirit of friendship, the backstop must go”. Political declarationThe EU and the Government have categorically ruled out any changes to the backstop and the wider withdrawal agreement, but they have said that the political declaration, the looser document which aims to sketch out the post-Brexit relationship between the UK and EU, can be amended. Recent weeks, however, have seen members of the ERG say they want the withdrawal agreement in its entirety scrapped. One MP, Mark Francois, said: “If there were any attempt to revive the withdrawal agreement, even without the backstop, the ERG would vote against it.”Mr Hogan is understood to have brought up such claims in his phone call with Mr Barclay. “The UK had made an agreement with the EU in good faith and it is up to them to propose ideas to break the impasse, taking account of the expressed view of the ERG members that the removal of the backstop would not convince them to vote in favour of the WA under any circumstances,” one source said, adding the EU is ready for new ideas “under the future relationship”.“In response, commissioner Hogan reiterated the EU’s well-established position that the withdrawal agreement, which was negotiated in good faith between the EU and the UK, is not open for renegotiation. “If the UK government continues to reject the withdrawal agreement, it is now the responsibility of the UK government to come forward with proposals for the future EU-UK relationship.

Photograph: Lucie Blackman TrustFamily handoutPA WireMalaysian police should accept an offer by French authorities to help investigate the death of Irish teenager Nóra Quoirin whose body was found near a jungle stream, the family’s lawyer said on Wednesday.Postmortem results are expected later in the day, police said, after the body of Nóra (15) was found on Tuesday.The teenager, who had special needs, disappeared from the jungle resort of Dusun, 63km outside the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, on Sunday August 4th. She was on holiday at the resort with her family.“The family expects the police to do a thorough investigation into the incident, including criminal angles,” their lawyer, Sankara N Nair, said, clarifying an earlier comment that the family “won’t press for anything” did not mean they opposed a full inquiry.He urged Malaysian police to accept an offer by French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian to help investigate the circumstances of the death.“It’s a very good proposal,” he said. “I hope police will accept the assistance.”Nóra’s mother is from Belfast while her father is French. The family is still at the resort, Mr Nair said.Police said they would answer questions on the incident later in the day.The family initially feared a criminal angle in the disappearance, saying she had special needs and had never before left her family voluntarily, a British victims’ group, the Lucie Blackman Trust, said in a statement issued on their behalf.An initial investigation yielded no evidence of criminal behaviour but police would look at all possibilities, Malaysia’s deputy police chief, Mazlan Mansor, said on Tuesday.In a statement, Nóra’s family said their “hearts are broken” and offered their thanks to those involved in the search.They described how the teenager had “truly touched the world”.“Nóra is at the heart of our family. She is the truest, most precious girl and we love her infinitely.“The cruelty of her being taken away is unbearable. Our hearts are broken.“We will always love our Nóra.”Lord Mayor of Belfast, Councillor John Finucane will open a book of condolence at City Hall on Wednesday afternoon in memory of Nóra.The Dusun resort, where the Quoirin family were staying when Nóra went missing, released a statement on Wednesday.“The Dusun family and staff would like to convey our deepest condolences to the family of Nóra Quoirin onher demise. We are devastated by the turn of events and we would like to extend our support and assistance in whatever way possible to the Quoirins during these very difficult times.“We deeply regret that this has happened to the Quoirins during their stay here. We will continue to provide our fullest cooperation to the authorities in their investigation.” – Additional reporting: Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3985431.1565764249!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"postmortem on n%C3%B3ra quoirin to take place as president sends sympathies","story":"Malaysian police have confirmed that a body has been found in the area where teenager Nóra Quoirin went missing on August 4th.

She was on holiday at the resort with her family.In an emotional statement, her family said their “hearts are broken” and offered their thanks to those involved in the search.Describing how the teenager had “truly touched the world”, her family said: “Nóra is at the heart of our family. She is the truest, most precious girl and we love her infinitely.“The cruelty of her being taken away is unbearable.

However, he said that if police suspected foul play was involved in Ms Quoirin’s death, the repatriation could be delayed.Bereavement careMr Searle said the trust was continuing to provide support and bereavement care to the family. He added that the family was “incredibly grateful” for all the support they had received from around the world.In a statement, President Michael D Higgins expressed his sympathy to the Quoirin family and thanked the Malaysian authorities and volunteers for their assistance in the search.“Our thoughts and prayers are now with Nóra’s family, at this most difficult time. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a h-anam,” he said.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar also offered his condolences. He said on Twitter: “They have experienced every family’s worst nightmare. I’d like to pay tribute to everyone who searched for Nóra. May she rest in peace.”Earlier, deputy inspector-general of police Mazlan Mansor told reporters that shortly before 2pm on Tuesday – 7am Irish time – one of the search-and-rescue teams was informed a body had been found beside a small stream about 2km from the Dusun resort by volunteers who were helping the search team.He said the remains had been winched by helicopter to a hospital mortuary, where the Quoirin family later identified their daughter.‘All possibilities’The body “was not in any clothings”, he said, and, while it remained a missing persons case, police were looking into all possibilities including the “angle of criminal investigation”. He declined to comment on whether the body had any visible injuries and said police needed to await the postmortem before commenting on this.The teenager’s parents, Meabh and Sebastien Quoirin, an Irish-French couple who have lived in London for 20 years, had earlier thanked those looking for their daughter. Nóra’s mother appealed for help on Monday and the teenager’s family had offered a reward of 50,000 Malaysian ringgit (about €10,600) donated by an anonymous Belfast business – for information leading to her return.Separately, €125,525 had been raised through two GoFundMe pages set up by the Quoirin and Agnew family following Nóra’s disappearance on August 4th. The funds were initially set up to support family taking part in the search and rescue effort. However, it is understood some of the money may now be used to help repatriate the Irish teenager’s body."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Comment: Remainer Bercow isn\u0026#39t just demeaning his office, he\u0026#39s damaging our entire political system\tParents are taking children to A\u0026ampE as getting a GP appointment is \u0026#39too difficult\u0026#39, survey findsHong Kong protesters apologise after violence in airportFrench politician mocked for posting allegedly doctored photograph of himself climbing mountainComment: Remainers lack the courage to defend the EU\u0026#39s dangerous plans for a federal EuropeComment: Philip Hammond got us into this mess.

It promised that those protecting the base would not be able to stop everyone and that participants would be able to see them aliens.After condemnation from US authorities, the event was shut down on Facebook. In response, the man who created it instead suggested that people should come to an event known as Alienstock, a festival where people could together celebrate extraterrestrials on the same date but at a safe distance from Area 51.Now the official website of Rachel, Nevada – the small town near the base that was chosen as a site for the event – has warned people that they could be in danger if they come to visit.It notes that the only services in the area are found at the extraterrestrial-themed\u0026nbspA\u0027Le\u0027Inn, which according to its website has already been booked up by alien fans.

It might also suggest that our understanding of the black hole is wrong, and that researchers will have to come up with a new model to understand it.First ever photo of black hole revealed by astronomersOne of the possibilities is that the flash was thrown out when the star known as\u0026nbspS0-2\u0026nbspmoved close to the black hole, in 2018. Researchers had been watching that star in an attempt to understand more about Einstein\u0027s theory of general relativity, but it appears to have found something even more surprising.It might also be the remnants of the passage of a dusty object known as G2, which passed by in 2014. Researchers had expected a thrilling display when that happened, but found themselves ultimately disappointed – it might be, however, that the exciting show was simply delayed rather than cancelled.Researchers now hope to keep examining the black hole both to watch for potential changes in its state and to better understand what physical processes might be responsible for the changes in how it looks.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The data suggested trading was “consistent with material illegal activity”.An FCA spokesperson responded: “The FCA has been aware of these matters since the first tweet and price movements on Tuesday of last week and at that point we began undertaking wide-ranging enquiries. We will continue to make enquiries using the wide range of data and resources at our disposal.”Burford said it detected signs of spoofing and layering – illegal methods of driving down share prices, which have resulted in convictions previously.For example, trading data showed that there was “an unusual flood” of order cancellations beginning shortly before Muddy Waters’ original tweet. Burford also said: “While Muddy Waters was suggesting that Burford was insolvent, it was at the same time buying Burford shares.”In its report, Muddy Waters labelled Burford a “poor business masquerading as a great one”. Burford’s shares plunged by 65 per cent over the course of 6 and 7 August, with almost £2bn wiped off the firm’s value.The following day, Burford hit back against the report, accusing Muddy Waters of peddling “factual inaccuracies” and “fallacious insinuations”.Christopher Bogart, chief executive of Burford, said the company’s “market-leading” business is the same as it was a week ago.He said: “What has changed is that a substantial amount of market value was wiped out by activity we believe is consistent with illegal market manipulation that has nothing to do with Burford’s business. That is wrong and that is illegal.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the UK, eyes are on inflation data out today.Please allow a moment for the live blog to loadPoll finds fears of worldwide economic contraction hit eight-year highGerman economy shrinks in second quarterUK inflation jumps 2.1 per cent in shock riseWhat exactly is an inverted yield curve and does it signal a recession is on the way?The general argument is that\u0026nbsptraders expect the economy to be weaker further out than it is today and for the central bank to be compelled to cut interest rates at some point to support growth. \u0026nbspSo traders bid the yields on longer-term bonds lower than shorter ones in anticipation of that monetary policy shift (rate cuts mean higher bond prices which, in turn, mean\u0026nbsplower bond yields).Yet, if this is what’s going on, there’s no clear reason why this cooling should mean an outright recession rather than simply a growth slowdown.The fact that a recession has tended to follow inversions\u0026nbsphas merely been the historical pattern.More answers can be found here:\u0026nbspInverted yield curve: Does the bond market really signal we’re heading for a recession?\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe pound has risen on the back of higher-than-expected inflation.\u0026nbspSterling is up 0.3 per cent against the dollar to $1.2094 and 0.2 per cent against the euro at €1.08.\u0026nbspBritain could face a Brussels sprouts shortage at Christmas after a week of heavy rain damaged crops in Lincolnshire.\u0026nbspThe situation is very concerning according to the British Growers Association.\u0026nbspShoppers are already facing a shortage of cauliflowers, cabbages and broccoli after Lincolnshire, a key UK farming region, was deluged with six inches of rain in a week in June.\u0026nbspBritish Growers chief executive Jack Ward says:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFor some, a year\u0027s work was destroyed in one week of rains.Crops come in waves but we\u0027re looking at the shortage going on for another two to three weeks, possibly extending to broccoli.\u0026nbspThe rain also affected a lot of young plants so there are likely to be problems into winter across the board with brassicas. \u0026nbspThere\u0027s some way to go but crops that have been waterlogged, like Brussels spouts, it\u0027s not getting them off to the start they need to produce the quantities we would want to see.Stock markets are tumbling across\u0026nbspEurope after the news that Germany\u0027s economy is in reverse.\u0026nbspGermany\u0027s Dax is down 0.76 per cent to 11,660.62France\u0027s CAC 40 down 0.71 per cent to 5,324.75UK\u0027s FTSE100 down 0.31 per cent to 7,227.48\u0026nbspDonald Trump\u0027s decision yesterday to delay tariffs on a host of Chinese imports has not been enough to temper the concerns about a trade war and economic slowdown.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMore on today\u0027s data showing an unexpectedly sharp rise in inflation:\u0026nbspUK inflation leaps to 2.1 per cent in shock rise\u0026nbspEconomists are issuing increasingly dire warnings about the health of the world economy.\u0026nbspGermany\u0027s government\u0026nbsphas plenty of fiscal room to turn on the spending taps and pull the country out of contraction but, as ever, will be reluctant to do so, says\u0026nbspSteen Jakobsen, chief economist at Saxo Bank.\u0026nbspThat means Europe\u0027s biggest economy will take France and Italy with it into a deep European recession he says.A slowdown in China appears to be worsening, which is beginning to have knock-on effects beyond China\u0027s borders.\u0026nbspToday\u0027s figures showing industrial production dropping back to just 4.8 per cent were driven\u0026nbspby manufacturing with\u0026nbspconstruction also appearing to be on shaky ground, writes Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\u0026nbspBeamish says: The July rate is weaker than the financial crisis lows, crushing hopes of a swift economic recovery sown with the bounce in June. \u0026nbspThese data cast doubt on theories that the Chinese authorities will see any appeal in waiting out Mr. Trump in the trade negotiations.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspUK house prices grew\u0026nbsp0.9 per cent in the year to June, the same increase as in May,\u0026nbspofficial figures show.\u0026nbspThe lowest annual growth was in London, where prices fell by 2.7 per cent\u0026nbspover the year to June 2019, less than the 3.1 per cent\u0026nbspfall in May 2019. Average house prices in London have now been falling over the year each month since March 2018.\u0026nbspAcross the UK, the average house cost £230,292, down from a\u0026nbsppeak of\u0026nbsp£232,000 in August 2018.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOne thing that is definitely set to cost more is regulated train fares - which includes season tickets in southeast England and many off-peak return tickets and peak-time fares around major cities.\u0026nbspThe fares are set to rise by 2.8 per cent next year, in line with the July rate of RPI inflation.Commuters from the new transport secretary’s constituency will pay an extra £84 a year to get to work in London from the start of 2020.\u0026nbspGrant Shapps is MP for Welwyn Hatfield. From January next year, the price of an annual season ticket from Welwyn Garden City to London will rise from £3,016 to £3,100.\u0026nbspEverthing you need to know from Simon Calder, our travel correspondent, is here:\u0026nbspRail fares set to rise by 2.8 per cent in 2020Rising inflation is not good news for consumers who have seen the spending power of their wages eroded.\u0026nbspToday inflation came in at 2.1 per cent while yesterday we heard that wages jumped 3.9 per cent, implying a real-terms average pay increase of 1.8 per cent.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBoris Johnson\u0027s\u0026nbspgenerous business donors have been revealed in the latest register of MP\u0027s interests.\u0026nbspBrown\u0027s, a posh hotel in\u0026nbspMayfair,\u0026nbspthrew\u0026nbspthe new prime minister a £12,000 victory bash on 23 July.\u0026nbspLondon hotels have been boosted by the weak pound which has fallen sharply since the Brexit vote and is predicted to plummet further if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.\u0026nbspPrivate equity firm boss Hazem Ben-Gacem donated £25,000 while Carphone Warehouse co-founder David Ross stumped up £10,000.Brexiteer Ian Duncan-Smith has hit back at Philip Hammond over his no-deal comments.\u0026nbspDuncan-Smith accuses the former chancellor of doing nothing to prepare us for leaving with no deal.\u0026nbspThe former Conservative Party leader told the BBC: By not preparing to leave with no deal, they made it certain that we\u0027d have to swallow everything that the European Union gave us.\u0026nbspSo the crime that has been committed in political terms was committed by him and those who did not prepare us to leave.BREAKING: inflation unexpectedly rose to\u0026nbsp2.1 per cent\u0026nbspin July, the\u0026nbspOffice for National Statistics says.\u0026nbspChris Jenkins, assistant head of inflation at ONS, says: The inflation rate increased slightly, with computer games, consoles and hotel prices rising more than they did last year.Conversely, air, international rail and sea fares did not rise by as much as 12 months ago.Philip Hammond\u0026nbsphas launched a blistering attack on\u0026nbspBoris Johnson, saying the new prime minister is allowing unelected people to pull the strings in Downing Street.The former chancellor attacked absurd claims from hardliners about a no-deal Brexit and said the first weeks\u0026nbspof the new government were not encouraging.The comments will\u0026nbspbe seen as an attack on\u0026nbspDominic Cummings, Mr Johnson\u0027s top policy adviser.Full story from political correspondent Ben Kentish here:Dominic Cummings targeted as Hammond claims Boris Johnson allowing \u0027unelected people\u0027 to \u0027pull the strings\u0027 in Number 10\u0026nbspThe number of fund managers predicting a global recession has jumped to an eight-year high according to a poll by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\u0026nbspIt found that 34 per cent of respondents think it is likely the world economy will begin to contract, up from just 6 per cent in April.\u0026nbspConcerns about the impact of a trade war topped the list of concerns, cited by more than half of investors.\u0026nbspThe IMF forecasts 3.2 per cent growth this year, down from 3.6 per cent last year.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOil prices fell on Wednesday on disappointing economic data from China and a rise in US\u0026nbspcrude inventories, erasing some of the sharp gains in the previous session after the US\u0026nbspsaid it would delay tariffs on some Chinese products, easing trade tensions.\u0026nbspBrent crude was down 46 cents, or 0.8 per cent, at $60.84 a barrel\u0026nbsp after rising 4.7 per cent\u0026nbspon Tuesday, the biggest percentage gain since December.\u0026nbspReutersHello, and welcome to The Independent\u0027s live coverage of business and economics news around the world.\u0026nbspGermany\u0027s economy shrank by 0.1 per cent in the second quarter as global trade conflicts, falling exports\u0026nbspand troubles in the car industry dragged growth downwards.German car makers, a crucial pillar of the economy, face\u0026nbsptougher emissions standards in Europe and China and a switch to electric cars, while Brexit uncertainty has weighed on confidence.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The review, launched in April, is now looking at all stages of the housebuilder’s construction and inspection process.Stephanie Barwise QC, who is leading the review, told PA such an extensive review was rare in the private sector.“I think it shows the genuine commitment that Persimmon has to resolving their customer services offering,” she said.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A hare runs on a moor near Ripon, North Yorkshire.Britain’s Jamie Chadwick wins first-ever W Series title.

It’s great if you’ve got the guts for it.”Clive Fenton, the former chief executive of fellow housebuilder McCarthy and Stone, is providing assistance to the review as an industry expert.The consultation period closes on 16 September, with findings of the review due by the end of the year.Roger Devlin, chair\u0026nbspof Persimmon, said: “It is important that we listen in order to improve and this consultation process is a vital step in hearing from our customers, employees, and many other people important to our business.“We hope that as many of our stakeholders as possible will take the time to contribute to this important process and I am very grateful to them for participating.”Persimmon faced criticism last year as it handed out hefty bonuses to executives, despite scoring relatively low for customer satisfaction in the industry.Former chief executive Jeff Fairburn’s circa £75m pay package in particular came under fire.He later stepped down, blaming the “distraction” of his pay deal.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Policymakers have looked for an explanation in the so-called supply side of the economy – the ways in which goods are made and services delivered – and pointed to declining technological innovation and cheap loans keeping unproductive “zombie” firms afloat, among other possible reasons.\u0026nbspBut the New Economics Foundation says its research shows that the government must also look at the demand side – the level and nature of spending across the country.\u0026nbsp“Average productivity, wages and living standards have experienced their worst decade in almost two centuries. It is increasingly clear that weak demand has been the overlooked problem,” said Alfie Stirling, head of economics at the think tank.\u0026nbsp“Raising demand by putting more cash in the pockets of the UK’s poorest workers, while giving people more paid time off from work to spend it, should now be part of a radical mix of options for any government that is serious about increasing productivity in a way that works for people and society.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Britain’s Jamie Chadwick wins first-ever W Series title.

Instead, companies rely on cheaper labour that can be shed quickly if demand doesn’t improve. As a result, productivity does not improve.The New Economics Foundation finds evidence of exactly this in official data.\u0026nbspIt says that since 2012, firms have increasingly preferred to hire rather than to invest and that, relative to all employees, the proportion of zero-hour and self-employed workers, as well as one-person “micro-companies”, has grown by two fifths since before the financial crisis. The corresponding lack of investment now explains at least a quarter of the UK’s gap in productivity with the historical trend.A report by the New Economics Foundation sets out a number of measures to lift demand, including gradual increases in statutory paid holiday and faster rises in the minimum wage.\u0026nbsp“The evidence shows that increased leisure time for workers can be expected to increase economy-wide demand,” the think tank says.It adds: “Increasing minimum wages is a particularly efficient way of boosting demand because workers on minimum wages are far more likely to spend rather than save any increases in salary, compared with higher-income iniduals.”Based on the same logic, the report recommends abolishing the personal allowance of income tax and using the extra public revenue on direct payouts to consumers and an increase in child benefit. It says this will redistribute £8bn a year from the richest 35 per cent of households to the remaining 65 per cent, with most of the gains concentrated on the poorest 10 per cent.\u0026nbspThe think tank also argues the government should frontload a large share of investment required to turn Britain into a zero-carbon economy over the next five years, in order to boost demand.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the UK, eyes are on inflation data out today.Please allow a moment for the live blog to loadPoll finds fears of worldwide economic contraction hit eight-year highGerman economy shrinks in second quarterUK inflation jumps 2.1 per cent in shock riseWhat exactly is an inverted yield curve and does it signal a recession is on the way?The general argument is that\u0026nbsptraders expect the economy to be weaker further out than it is today and for the central bank to be compelled to cut interest rates at some point to support growth. \u0026nbspSo traders bid the yields on longer-term bonds lower than shorter ones in anticipation of that monetary policy shift (rate cuts mean higher bond prices which, in turn, mean\u0026nbsplower bond yields).Yet, if this is what’s going on, there’s no clear reason why this cooling should mean an outright recession rather than simply a growth slowdown.The fact that a recession has tended to follow inversions\u0026nbsphas merely been the historical pattern.More answers can be found here:\u0026nbspInverted yield curve: Does the bond market really signal we’re heading for a recession?\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe pound has risen on the back of higher-than-expected inflation.\u0026nbspSterling is up 0.3 per cent against the dollar to $1.2094 and 0.2 per cent against the euro at €1.08.\u0026nbspBritain could face a Brussels sprouts shortage at Christmas after a week of heavy rain damaged crops in Lincolnshire.\u0026nbspThe situation is very concerning according to the British Growers Association.\u0026nbspShoppers are already facing a shortage of cauliflowers, cabbages and broccoli after Lincolnshire, a key UK farming region, was deluged with six inches of rain in a week in June.\u0026nbspBritish Growers chief executive Jack Ward says:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFor some, a year\u0027s work was destroyed in one week of rains.Crops come in waves but we\u0027re looking at the shortage going on for another two to three weeks, possibly extending to broccoli.\u0026nbspThe rain also affected a lot of young plants so there are likely to be problems into winter across the board with brassicas. \u0026nbspThere\u0027s some way to go but crops that have been waterlogged, like Brussels spouts, it\u0027s not getting them off to the start they need to produce the quantities we would want to see.Stock markets are tumbling across\u0026nbspEurope after the news that Germany\u0027s economy is in reverse.\u0026nbspGermany\u0027s Dax is down 0.76 per cent to 11,660.62France\u0027s CAC 40 down 0.71 per cent to 5,324.75UK\u0027s FTSE100 down 0.31 per cent to 7,227.48\u0026nbspDonald Trump\u0027s decision yesterday to delay tariffs on a host of Chinese imports has not been enough to temper the concerns about a trade war and economic slowdown.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMore on today\u0027s data showing an unexpectedly sharp rise in inflation:\u0026nbspUK inflation leaps to 2.1 per cent in shock rise\u0026nbspEconomists are issuing increasingly dire warnings about the health of the world economy.\u0026nbspGermany\u0027s government\u0026nbsphas plenty of fiscal room to turn on the spending taps and pull the country out of contraction but, as ever, will be reluctant to do so, says\u0026nbspSteen Jakobsen, chief economist at Saxo Bank.\u0026nbspThat means Europe\u0027s biggest economy will take France and Italy with it into a deep European recession he says.A slowdown in China appears to be worsening, which is beginning to have knock-on effects beyond China\u0027s borders.\u0026nbspToday\u0027s figures showing industrial production dropping back to just 4.8 per cent were driven\u0026nbspby manufacturing with\u0026nbspconstruction also appearing to be on shaky ground, writes Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\u0026nbspBeamish says: The July rate is weaker than the financial crisis lows, crushing hopes of a swift economic recovery sown with the bounce in June. \u0026nbspThese data cast doubt on theories that the Chinese authorities will see any appeal in waiting out Mr. Trump in the trade negotiations.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspUK house prices grew\u0026nbsp0.9 per cent in the year to June, the same increase as in May,\u0026nbspofficial figures show.\u0026nbspThe lowest annual growth was in London, where prices fell by 2.7 per cent\u0026nbspover the year to June 2019, less than the 3.1 per cent\u0026nbspfall in May 2019. Average house prices in London have now been falling over the year each month since March 2018.\u0026nbspAcross the UK, the average house cost £230,292, down from a\u0026nbsppeak of\u0026nbsp£232,000 in August 2018.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOne thing that is definitely set to cost more is regulated train fares - which includes season tickets in southeast England and many off-peak return tickets and peak-time fares around major cities.\u0026nbspThe fares are set to rise by 2.8 per cent next year, in line with the July rate of RPI inflation.Commuters from the new transport secretary’s constituency will pay an extra £84 a year to get to work in London from the start of 2020.\u0026nbspGrant Shapps is MP for Welwyn Hatfield.

Nearly three in four secondary schools are academies, as well as more than a quarter of primary schools.Protests by parents and children stop schools from becoming academiesThe first academies were set up in 2002 by Labour to improve standards in failing schools. From 2010, the numbers grew after the coalition government allowed all schools to convert to academies.The Conservative government has been pushing academisation, which gives schools freedoms to set their curricula, admissions policies and working conditions, as well as their policy for school improvement.Chris Keates, acting general secretary of the NASUWT teachers’ union, said: “The research by the University of Oxford does not come as a surprise, but it is no less shocking.”She said: “It is unacceptable that children and young people are being denied their fundamental entitlement to be taught by qualified teachers. It is also unacceptable for other staff to be exploited by schools that require them to do the job of a qualified teacher while\u0026nbspbeing paid less.“Every school should be investing in recruiting and retaining teachers rather than devising strategies to pay teachers as little as they can get away with.“Parents have a right to expect that a government that cares about their children’s futures will act to ensure that every child is guaranteed the right to be taught by qualified teachers.”Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “The vast majority of schools of all types seek to recruit appropriately skilled and qualified teachers.“There may be times when they decide to recruit specialists who do not have QTS in subjects where there are severe teacher shortages such as maths and physics. However, they will always ensure such staff are properly supported. Obviously the best solution would be for more action by the government to tackle the crisis in teacher recruitment and retention so that all schools can recruit the teachers they need.”Nick Brook, deputy general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said\u0026nbspthere were\u0026nbspsome\u0026nbsplegitimate reasons academies or private schools might choose to employ a teacher without QTS – such as when they\u0026nbsphave some particular skill, like\u0026nbspin art or pastoral care.But he added: “That said, the greatest rise in the use of unqualified teachers has been in sponsored academies – a school type typically found in more disadvantaged areas.“We already know that recruiting and retaining teachers in schools serving disadvantaged communities is challenging, so the rise of unqualified teachers in these schools is concerning. It is children from disadvantaged backgrounds who are most in need of the very best teachers.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “More than 95 per cent\u0026nbspof teachers in state funded schools – which includes academies – have qualified teacher status.

Before the reforms, universities could use actual results when considering applications.It has been suggested that parents who are more familiar with the university application system could be placing more pressure on teachers to give their children higher predicted grades to secure offers from top universities, leaving pupil from poorer backgrounds at a further disadvantage.The surge in the proportion of university applicants being offered a place on a degree regardless of their exam grades –\u0026nbspknown as unconditional offers – could also disadvantage students as they could become demotivated in their final year of schooling and find the step up to university more difficult.How to get a university course place through Clearing on results dayHowever, radically changing the exam timetable could also leave poorer students in the dark and at a disadvantage, the head of the admissions service argues. \u0026nbspA consultation run by Ucas in 2012 found that an introduction of PQA would significantly disadvantage underrepresented and disabled students unless calendars were changed.Ucas chief, Clare Marchant, believes poorer pupils lacking parental support would have to make quick decisions about degree courses at a time when schools are closed and teachers are absent. \u0026nbspShe also argues that universities could struggle to put in place support services for those who are first in the family to enter higher education, as well as disabled students, in time for start of term.And now that a record number of students are taking up places on degrees through clearing, Ms Marchant argues that there is already a “genuine post-qualifications admissions route” in place.The debate between Ucas and leading groups in the sector rages on. But we will have to wait and see whether the Department for Education and Universities UK decide to finally make a change. \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They were being used to improve the AI transcription by allowing people to ensure that messages were being transcribed accurately.Facebook dark mode is finally coming to mobile appThe new discovery, first reported by Bloomberg, comes after outcry across the technology industry. Companies including Apple, Amazon and Google all used human contractors to check AI transcriptions until very recently – and have stopped in the wake of widespread public anger.Facebook has been clear that the feature was only enabled when people explicitly opted into it. As such, it is not a comment on whether or not phones are listening to their users while they talk by default or when not using the transcription service, which is a claim regularly made about Facebook but which it has always strenuously\u0026nbspdenied.Facebook introduced the transcription feature in 2015. While Facebook does give some warnings in various parts of the app that audio recorded by it could be stored by the company, it does not seem to give any explicit indication that the recordings could be passed on to third-party contractors to listen to.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. 130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream.

The entire cast of dogs appearing in the film were rescued from shelters and adopted by cast and crew upon completion of filming.Theroux and Thompson have been joined by an all-star cast of actors also lending their voices, including Janelle Monae, Ashley Jensen, Benedict Wong and Sam Elliott. Monae has also contributed three original songs to the film, including a far less racist version of the notorious “Siamese Cat Song” from the original movie.Everything we know about Disney+Disney remakes have made over $7 billion since 2010Unlike Disney’s recent live-action or photo-realistic remakes, including Aladdin, The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast, the new Lady and the Tramp will only be released on their forthcoming streaming platform Disney+, where it will be available upon the platform’s launch on 12 November.Lady and the Tramp\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspBeauty and the Beast\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s great if you’ve got the guts for it.”Clive Fenton, the former chief executive of fellow housebuilder McCarthy and Stone, is providing assistance to the review as an industry expert.The consultation period closes on 16 September, with findings of the review due by the end of the year.Roger Devlin, chair\u0026nbspof Persimmon, said: “It is important that we listen in order to improve and this consultation process is a vital step in hearing from our customers, employees, and many other people important to our business.“We hope that as many of our stakeholders as possible will take the time to contribute to this important process and I am very grateful to them for participating.”Persimmon faced criticism last year as it handed out hefty bonuses to executives, despite scoring relatively low for customer satisfaction in the industry.Former chief executive Jeff Fairburn’s circa £75m pay package in particular came under fire.He later stepped down, blaming the “distraction” of his pay deal.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The inherent \u0027message\u0027 is that this woman is accountable to her boyfriend, must obey his orders and must seek his permission to live her life.\u0026nbspMental health services failing to ask women about domestic abuseIn this case, it has manifested in a set of rules, but often control is a pattern of subtle behaviours. Such controlling behaviours are normalised and legitimised in society which can make it difficult to recognise and challenge. Technology has made this easier - from apps that track women\u0027s movements, to websites that encourage revenge on women who \u0027disobey\u0027 their partners, and text, calls and social media providing platforms to control women even when they are away from the abuser. Ultimately, many men still enjoy power and control over women who are disadvantaged by a patriarchal system which facilitates and excuses men’s violence.”\u0026nbspThe latest figures show that out of an estimated two million victims of domestic abuse in the last year, some 1.3 million were women.The majority (70 per cent) of victims of domestic violence deaths are female. Every week in the UK,\u0026nbsptwo women are murdered by a partner or ex-partner.Suzanne Jacob, chief executive of domestic abuse charity SafeLives, said: “Firstly, we hope Zoe is safe and has the support she needs around her. This kind of controlling behaviour is extremely worrying and is not ‘normal’ in a relationship. A partner should make you feel loved and valued, not tell you what to wear, who to speak to or how to behave. “If you recognise any of these behaviours in your own relationship, know that there is support out there.

Policymakers have looked for an explanation in the so-called supply side of the economy – the ways in which goods are made and services delivered – and pointed to declining technological innovation and cheap loans keeping unproductive “zombie” firms afloat, among other possible reasons.\u0026nbspBut the New Economics Foundation says its research shows that the government must also look at the demand side – the level and nature of spending across the country.\u0026nbsp“Average productivity, wages and living standards have experienced their worst decade in almost two centuries. It is increasingly clear that weak demand has been the overlooked problem,” said Alfie Stirling, head of economics at the think tank.\u0026nbsp“Raising demand by putting more cash in the pockets of the UK’s poorest workers, while giving people more paid time off from work to spend it, should now be part of a radical mix of options for any government that is serious about increasing productivity in a way that works for people and society.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Britain’s Jamie Chadwick wins first-ever W Series title.

Instead, companies rely on cheaper labour that can be shed quickly if demand doesn’t improve. As a result, productivity does not improve.The New Economics Foundation finds evidence of exactly this in official data.\u0026nbspIt says that since 2012, firms have increasingly preferred to hire rather than to invest and that, relative to all employees, the proportion of zero-hour and self-employed workers, as well as one-person “micro-companies”, has grown by two fifths since before the financial crisis. The corresponding lack of investment now explains at least a quarter of the UK’s gap in productivity with the historical trend.A report by the New Economics Foundation sets out a number of measures to lift demand, including gradual increases in statutory paid holiday and faster rises in the minimum wage.\u0026nbsp“The evidence shows that increased leisure time for workers can be expected to increase economy-wide demand,” the think tank says.It adds: “Increasing minimum wages is a particularly efficient way of boosting demand because workers on minimum wages are far more likely to spend rather than save any increases in salary, compared with higher-income iniduals.”Based on the same logic, the report recommends abolishing the personal allowance of income tax and using the extra public revenue on direct payouts to consumers and an increase in child benefit. It says this will redistribute £8bn a year from the richest 35 per cent of households to the remaining 65 per cent, with most of the gains concentrated on the poorest 10 per cent.\u0026nbspThe think tank also argues the government should frontload a large share of investment required to turn Britain into a zero-carbon economy over the next five years, in order to boost demand.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And we should all rejoice in that.DAMNING new statistics reveal the average wait for a non-urgent GP appointment is now more than two weeks.This is simply not good enough.Boris Johnson promised in his first speech as Prime Minister that it was his job to make sure we don’t have to wait for weeks on end to see our doctor.The latest figures highlight the enormity of that task.There is a limit to what can be achieved by under-pressure health service staff and, though the PM has moved quickly to free up extra funding, there will never be an endless supply of money for the NHS, no matter who is in No.What is needed is serious reform and some radical thinking.Jeremy Corbyn will doubtless oppose any new ideas and continue using the NHS as a political football.Butthe Prime Minister can prove as single-minded on the health service as he is proving on Brexit, there is still hope.In spite of teething problems, it’s great to see the right decisions being reached by the video assistant referees — but fans should not be left in the dark while it happens.Refs should be mic’d up, like in rugby, so supporters can hear what’s going on.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There were security checkpoints in every city centre street, bag searches in most shops.In my teenage years, when I attended school in the west of Ulster, one of my fellow pupils was killed in the infamous IRA bomb attack on Lord Mountbatten’s boat off the Irish coast in .Two years later, the terrorist and hunger striker Bobby Sands was briefly my MP before his self-inflicted death, an event that provoked more rioting.Despite the ruthlessness of the IRA, the British security forces never wavered in their duty.Even in the face of mortal danger from petrol bombs, stones and even bullets, the soldiers did not buckle.In the cauldron of historic animosities, stoked by the venom of the IRA, they showed impressive forbearance, undermining the Republican propaganda about British oppression.There were disastrous failures, however, like the loss of discipline at Bloody Sunday in Derry, , when British paratroopers fired on a group of protesters, killing  of them.Over the years, their tenacity gradually wore down the enemy, particularly through the use of sophisticated military intelligence.Towards the end of the s, the entire IRA network was riddled with British agents.Even Frank Scappaticci, the Republicans’ own head of its feared Internal Security Unit – known as the “Nutting Squad” - was alleged to be an informer.Such deep penetration made it almost impossible for the IRA to carry on using the bomb and the bullet effectively .By the close of the Troubles, British security forces were estimated to be foiling two out of every three planned IRA operations.One former IRA man, now a Dublin solicitor, admitted, “It was a complete and utter defeat, absolutely.”It was a defeat that heralded a new era in Northern Ireland.In practice, the peace process was a declaration of surrender by the IRA.Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness did not suddenly see the light and become peaceniks.They embraced democratic politics because they recognised that their terror movement, beaten by the British forces, could no longerproperly.After the Good Friday Agreement of , the Republicans agreed to decommission their weapons without achieving any of their key political aims. Northern Ireland remains in the United Kingdom, while the partition of Ireland continues.For political reasons, the British army has never received the credit it deserves for its remarkable victory.In the new climate of co-operation, there is an understandable wish to avoid any triumphalism.But what is reprehensible is the persistent hounding of British veterans who bravely served their country in the Troubles, but are now the subject of official inquiries into past misconduct.No fewer than  of these veterans are said to be currently under investigation, despite endless pledges from politicians about an end to the grotesque witch-hunts.The gross betrayal of their service is bad enough, but even more offensive are the double-standards, for the Good Friday Agreement facilitated the early release of scores of terrorists, as well an amnesty for many on the run.If the peace process is meant to draw a line in the sand about Ulster’s dark past, it should apply to everyone.Thanks in large part to the efforts of the British army, the future should be bright for Northern Ireland.But clouds are gathering, due to suspension of the devolved assembly and concerns about a hard border because of Brexit.The fragility of the situation means that British politicians should tread carefully, respecting the rights of both communities in the province, as well as the interests of Dublin, our closest neighbour.But the Tories have done anything but that.Having thrown away their majority in , they have formed a dubious alliance with the DUP, a reactionary outfit which presents itself as the voice of Ulster but in fact won only  per cent of the vote at the last election.As cheerleaders for unionism, the Conservatives now talk about “our precious union”, while regrettably Boris Johnson has even given himself the additional title of “Minister for the Union.”Whilst many Brits feel passionate about keeping the union together, this rhetoric may not be what Northern Ireland needs.The British Government is meant to be an honest broker rather than a partisan advocate for one side.“Rigorous impartiality” was central to the success of the Good Friday Agreement. For the sake of harmony, that spirit cannot be allowed to disappear.The campaign in Northern Ireland may not have had the glamour of victories like Egypts El Alamein or Waterloo, but it was still one of the British army’s greatest achievements.It would be a tragedypast military determination were to be squandered by present political bungling.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are the only guests out here at the moment.We were enjoying lunch when we saw over a dozen people getting off their speedboats and landing on the island.When we looked harder, we could see the FBI logo on the backs of their shirts.It didnt take long for us to realise they must be conducting a raid on Epsteins house.It is feared Epstein may have abused so-called sex slaves at the lavish Caribbean estate including a bizarre temple built on the island.The billionaire bought Little St James more than two decades ago - transforming it into a high-security private oasis, complete with a mansion and a bizarre blue and white gold-domed structure.To date, the island has remained Epstein’s main residence, but has been shrouded in mystery.With high security, its in a secluded location, while its locally-known moniker as Paedophile Island has given rise to more sinister theories about its use.Neighbouring islander Kevin Goodrich, who operates boat charters from nearby St Thomas, said: “Everybody called it ‘Paedophile Island ... It’s our dark corner.”Epstein set about building an enormous stone mansion with cream-coloured walls and a bright turquoise roof surrounded by a maids’ quarters.Years later, and on the other southwest edge of the island, he built a square-shaped blue and white building resembling a religious temple, topped with a gold dome.Many have speculated that the child sex abuse Epstein has been accused of may have occurred in this secluded space.Workers claimed the structure was a music room, fitted with a grand piano and acoustic walls.But Epstein - a classically-trained pianist - positioned the building far away from other structures on the island.A medieval-style lock on the front of the temple became a curious point of conversation for those working on the site.Chicago-based contractor James Both shared his professional thoughts on the buildings door with Business Insider.Its styled like what you might see on a castle, with what appears to be a reinforcing lock bar across the face, he said.What makes it peculiar is thatyou wanted to keep people out, the bar would be placed inside the building, [but the] locking bar appears to be placed on the outside ... asit were intended to lock people in.The front of the building is flanked by statues painted in gold one which appears to be Poseidon, Greek god of the sea, and another that looks like a pair of birds.It is surrounded by a line of palm trees and a terrace with a labyrinth mot.A small structure downhill from the building has led some to believe it serves as a second entrance and suggest that the space extends underground.Both suggested: It is absolutely possible to install a dwelling and elevator underneath the structure.If an elevator was built there, [there] would most likely be a record with the vendor who installed the elevator, as they typically require yearly maintenance and inspection.Other curious details about the building have since emerged.It was constructed sometime between  and  - after Epsteins  guilty plea of soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution.The billionaire financier maintained a low profile after he received a lenient plea deal over claims he paid girls for sexual massages.Many began to believe his need for privacy appeared more sinister.The palm-fringed paradise became the subject of lurid rumours.Those who worked for Epstein in constructing the buildings said they signed non-disclosure agreements and refused to talk.Security guards keep watch along the islands shores.Before Epsteins  guilty plea, he would visit the island archipelago about two or three times a month for stays of three or four days, according to the former staffer who spoke to SF Gate.He described it as a Zen-like retreat where women would sometimes sunbathe topless or in the nude.At least one alleged victim has since spoken out about an orgy on the island she had with Epstein and others, in a court affidavit obtained by the Associated Press.The same victim said that she saw former President Bill Clinton on the island but never witnessed him having sex with anyone.A Clinton spokesman issued a statement denying the claims, saying Clinton never travelled to the island.Virginia Giuffre, previously Virginia Roberts, has recently alleged she was among a number of young girls who were abused by Epstein and others when she was a teenager.In a  lawsuit, Ms Giuffre claimed that she was a “sex slave” for Epstein, and that she was abused in his homes in New York, New Mexico, Florida, and the US Virgin Islands.Giuffre, now , said she was allegedly forced into “an orgy with numerous other under-aged girls.”She also made alarming claims involving the Duke of York, saying she “was forced to have sexual relations with [Prince Andrew] when she was a minor” at Epstein’s Little St James estate.A Buckingham Palace spokesperson told Sun Online: “It is emphatically denied The Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts.”She renewed her claims from  in an interview with the Miami Herald, saying she was  when she met Epstein, who she was introduced to by British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of Robert Maxwell.The mother-of-three said she was sent to Epstein’s private Caribbean island and groomed as a sex slave.Back in , police in Florida received reports Epstein had sexually abused underage girls in his mansion in Palm Beach.According to an indictment, Epstein recruited victims to provide massages, which they would perform nude or partially nude.Prosecutors said the encounters would become increasingly sexual, where Epstein would masturbate and ask victims to touch him while he did.According to court documents in Florida, authorities say at least  underage girls were brought into Epsteins Palm Beach mansion for what turned into sexual encounters.Courtney  Wild and Michelle Licata were part of a  criminal case brought against Epstein in FloridaWild was just  when she alleges Epstein forced her into performing sex acts on him, ABC News reported.She said: “I was , I had braces on.“Like, I remember standing in his kitchen ... and he also had a lot of girls there all the time.”Michelle Licata was aged  when she claims she was brought to the banker’s mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, where she was paid to give him a massage.She said: “He said, god, youre just so beautul and sexy and gorgeous and it was making me feel really uncomfortable.“Then he wanted me to rub his back, and he kept asking me to go lower and he was kind of talking to me.”Epstein was sentenced to only  months in jail."},{"url":null,"title":"lottery couple scoop 1m scratchcard pet food","story":"Andrew and Paula Hancock thanked their cat Shortcake for their newfound fortune after buying the winning ticket at their local petrol station.The couple, who run a catering business together, had forgotten the cats dinner but Andrew picked up a Monopoly Millionaire Scratchcard instead after popping to the shops.In the rush of excitement on realising he had landed the couple a seven-figure jackpot, Mr Hancock forgot to buy six-year-old ginger tom Shortcakes food again -

Theyre so rough with them. One person whipping to go into the water and another hanging off the horses neck.Another added: I somewhat feel sorry for horses who have to endure people on their backs whipping them.Others questioned why the police did nothing, with one person saying they were powerless.The programme showed the residents of the quiet Cumbrian town boarding up windows and erecting barriers in preparation for the annual fair - which brings a total of , travellers and visitors into the area.Locals claim aggressive travellers “break every law under the sun” when they arrive for their annual pilgrimage.The programme, which covers the June  fair, captures the rising tension as the police crack down on traditions such as “flashing” – riding horses through the streets at a dangerous speed – and washing the horses in the river.The majority of the travellers are well-behaved and only eight arrests were made during this years fair. They say the event is a wholesome tradition that dates back three centuries and the “most important event in the gypsy calendar.They hit back at the locals, claiming they are “racist”.“There’s quite a lot of racism in that village, says one lad.As soon as you mention the word traveller or gypsy they think you’re scum because there are a few gypsies out there that give others a bad name but there’s good and bad in every community.”But pensioner Mervyn says: “Last year was horrendous. They were urinating in the bus shelters and destroying the hay fields.“They’d broken into stables to use them as lavatories. You had to duck when the young boys were driving past because they wind down their windows, clear their throats and spit.”The Appleby Horse Fair has been held every year since   and attracts , travellers and gypsies, , caravans and hundreds of horse drawn carriages plus.A further , visitors flock to enjoy the atmosphere and spectacle of the gathering.But for local police and residents, the fair presents a headache – with the town centre becoming a no-go area as horses are raced through the streets.Local hotel owner Nigel, born and bred in Appleby, says the town is “unrecognisable” throughout the four day fair.“In Appleby, everyone knows each other, we all grew up together and it’s a nice place to live,” he says.“For the ordinary residents of Appleby, [the fair] is pretty awful. You can’t go out, you can’t get to the shops, you can’t drive around.“There are people parking in front of your house, parking a caravan on your front lawn.”Nigel says he locks up the hotel and only lets guests in through the front door.“We put little wooden things on the windows so you can only open them so far, so you can’t get in from the outside.”Mervyn adds: “It reminds me of the air raid precautions in World War II. You don’t expect that in an English country town. I was horried when I saw it.Another resident says she makes sure her doors are locked “so no one comes in the back. You are a bit worried about that.”A third claims the travellers urinated in his garden on two occasions last year.After sundown, the fairgoers descend on the town’s pubs – and things can get rowdy.In , the fairs worst year for violence, a mass brawl broke out and, in total, there were  arrests,  crimes and  incidents.In , a -year-old grandfather accidentally ran over a toddler who ran in front of his car from a traveller encampment, breaking his arm. He was dragged from his car and beaten, suffering a broken vertebrae, black eyes and a bruised head, neck, spleen, liver and kidney.This year, however, the event passed more peacefully and there were just eight arrests.But Kaseem, a bouncer called in as extra security, says the hard-drinking revellers “start kicking off” when told the pub is closing.“As you come towards last orders it’s not like anything you’ve seen before,” adds pub landlord Kyle. “Until you work here you don’t realise what it can be like. We just have to get through it.”At the local Indian restaurant, owner Tariq has replaced his usual chairs with cheaper versions because he doesnt mindthey get destroyed and he says some of the lads that come in refuse to pay the bill or try and do a runner.“One night there was a huge problem with four guys who said they didn’t want to pay for their food,” he says. “I told them ‘You ate here so you’ve got to pay for it’ but they were having none of it.“We had a girl working here and she got that scared she didn’t want to come back.”But the travellers claim the fears are unjustied, and that the locals are prejudiced against them.Romany dad John says: “People look down on us like we’re a piece of sh**. We’re not. We work hard for a living and look after our children like everyone .“We respect the people who don’t do this. They should respect us the same. We should all get on with each other.”Flashing is part and parcel of the horse trade among travelling but the speeding horses prove a hazard to some and accidents are common.In , two horses collided and died during flashing and in  a woman was rushed to hospital with head injuries after being “run over” by a horse and cart during a  carriage race on a public road.Throughout the Channel  show, local police constable Ruth is filmed constantly telling the travellers to “slow down” as they hit dangerous speeds on the slippery rain-soaked road surfaces.But the travellers round on her, shouting “we’re not children”, with one insisting he has a buyer interested in the horse so “he’s got to have speed.”Another defiant seller says: “It’s storming down with rain now but we’re still here and we’ll carry on.”But one helmetless rider pays the price when he is thrown from a speeding horse, suffering serious head injuries that leave him “bleeding from the ear”, and is carted off to hospital in an ambulance. He was discharged two weeks later.Tensions are stretched further when police erect a road block to prevent flashing in the high street and, when  hours of rain leads to rising water levels, police are forced to cut off access to the River Eden.Traditionally horses and riders, who have travelled hundreds of miles to the site, wash themselves by plunging into the River Eden, ensuring the animals being traded are “clean and pretty” for potential buyers.A few years ago, a horse drowned after being led into a deeper part of the river and PC Ruth is concerned the same could happen again.“We can’t let anybody in the river at all,” she says. “It’s far too dangerous for the horses.”But the travellers are convinced the measures are all designed to shut the event down for good.“This fair’s been going on for years and years and they’re trying to stop it,” claims one woman. “They can’t, it’s our heritage.”Another woman, forced to park her two wagons and graze her horses on the side of a busy road because of blocks, rants about the “rude, disrespectful” police.“We’re just people living how we want to live. We’re not horrible people.“No matter what they try and do they’re not going to stop it, are they ”For -year-old Romany Jack, who spent three weeks travelling up from Wales, it’s a chance to catch up with the many friends and family members that are scattered around the country.“I love going to Appleby for that week,” he says. “Your heart lights up to it. Been doing this all my le my whole le, since I was a kid.“We all meet here and we do deals with horses or sell a bird, a canary – anything we can make money with.“Andwe rob one another we rob one another with the [deal on the] horses. You rob me this time, I’ll get you next time.”Head gypsy Billy Welch, who liaises with police and the local council to arrange toilets, rubbish skips and suitable grazing for the horses, says the fair is “sacred” to both old and young. “If you say to these children ‘Do you want to go to Disneyland in Florida or Appleby ’ they definitely want to go to Appleby,” he says. “There’s no contest. It is literally our Mecca. This is where our ancestors have been coming for centuries.“When we sit around our campfires it gives us a feeling of belonging, of ancestry. When we’re here we feel closer to God. It’s God’s country.”The Town The Gypsies Took Over airs tonight on Channel  at pmOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It must not happen.And The Sun revealed today that Mr Hammond has penned a letter with  other senior Tories - including seven former ministers - demanding he commit to leaving the EU with a deal and compromise to get one.It said he set the bar so high that there is no realistic probability of a deal being done now.Mr Hammond’s bombshell letter shatters a Brexit peace among Tories since Boris was elected as the party’s new leader three weeks ago on Tuesday.It was also signed by four other Remain-backing ex-Cabinet ministers who resigned last month before Boris could fire them – David Lidington, David Gauke, Rory Stewart and Greg Clark – as well as  other former Tory ministers.The signature of so many senior Tories is seen as a show of force ahead of Boris’ showdown with Parliament over a No Deal Brexit when it s next month.A spokesman for Mr Hammond said on Tuesday night: “A private letter was written by  like-minded MPs to restate their support for getting a deal and to remind the Prime Minister of his assertion that no deal was a million to one”.Cabinet allies of Mr Johnson hit back, and claimed Mr Hammond secretly told Ireland’s finance minister then that Britain will NEVER leave the EU without a deal, in stark contrast to Government policy at the time that no deal was better than a bad deal.A senior government source added: “Philip Hammond deliberately undermined Mrs May’s negotiating position in private, making the ability to strike a deal even more dficult”.One furious ally the new PM said: “Philip Hammond is effectively doing the EU’s negotiation for it, which is quite frankly pretty typical of him”.Later today Boris will do his first Peoples PMQs with a live Facebook broadcast taking the publics questions."},{"url":null,"title":"bbc staff get 20 pay hikes as pensioners lose their free tv licences","story":"Hundreds of workers at the corporation enjoyed an average rise of £, – costing taxpayers an extra £.million.Figures show  staff members were granted a bump of between  and  per cent followed by another  getting a rise of more than  per cent last year, the Times reports.The total cost across the Beeb was enough to continue free TV licences for , OAPs.Age campaigners described the pay hike as sickening.News of the controversial pay rises comes at an awkward time for the Beeb with corporation chiefs claiming they cannot afford to give out free licences anymore.They now plan to charge .million pensioners £-a-week – while shelling out millions for on-air talent.Last month the corporation was blasted for spending £million on wages in .This represented £million rise on the previous  months and was blasted as “unjustiable” by Tory MP Damian Collins.The £million BBC bill covers all “on-air roles” — from little-known broadcasters to stars earning hundreds of thousands.Household names like Gary Lineker, around £,,-a-year, and Graham Norton, around £, yearly, are among the BBCs highest earners.It is up nearly seven per cent on the previous year — about ½ times the inflation rate.

Andrew,  who runs a catering business with Paula, , explained: “We’d had a busy -hour sht and forgot his food so I said I’d nip out. “The plan was to fill the car up with fuel and then get the cat food. “But while paying for the fuel I bought the scratchcard then sat in the car. “Then I realised I’d forgotten the cat food...

Paula added that their beloved pet was a big softy at home but “likes a fight and keeps everyone up at night.”She said: “He doesn’t always win and often comes in limping, with chunks missing.” The couple, from Mansfield, Notts, are set to pay off their mortgage and may build a new home after the July  win.

I then prepare photos for my next post, engage with my followers, I make sure I reply to every single comment and interact with my audience to get to know them a little better.

It started as a passion but I soon realised this is what I wanted to commit all of my time to and went full time just over a year ago. I feel so grateful that I get to do what I love. I enjoy everything about it - the great opportunities, the social side of it, meeting like-minded inspirational people, working with some of my favourite brands.  Also through being an influencer I get to attend many amazing launch parties, red carpet events, film premieres and press trips. However Victoria admits thereaposs one big downside to doing what she does - trolls.

The -year-old Duke of York was snapped dressed in a smart suit getting out of a dark green Range Rover and climbing the steps into the aircraft in Aberdeen this morning. He appeared to be holding a hat and what looked like a white dressing gown. Several bags were loaded into the aircraft, while a dog was also seen being carried on board.

The unied outing also came as questions mounted about his friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who was found hanged in his jail cell on Saturday.    It is understood Andrew was due to spend the whole week at the castle after being invited by his mother. A spokeswoman for Buckingham Palace toldthey do not comment on private movements in holiday time.

An insider told The Sun: “In previous years the Duchess has left the day before the Queen’s husband arrives.    “This year he arrived yesterday, several days earlier than expected, which is rather strange, so the Duchess left.”  Meanwhile, Andrew was one of many names dragged into the scandal surrounding Epstein after the release of , court papers. Epstein, , reportedly hanged himself at politan Correctional Center in Manhattan, New York, where he was being held on sex trafficking charges. His apparent suicide came hours after hundreds of pages of court documents were unsealed alleging new details of sexual abuse claims against him.    The documents exposed new claims against Prince Andrew and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell. The Duke, has denied allegations that he had sex with one of Epsteinaposs accusers, Virginia Giuffre, then aged , and groped a second woman at the wealthy financieraposs home.

Meghan, , wanted to use the opportunity to shine a light on female trailblazers – and she insisted she would NOT be a cover girl. The former Suits star had graced scores of glossy publications in her days as a Hollywood actress. But since joining the Royal Family she and husband Harry have vowed to use their profiles to highlight issues close to their hearts. So she was determined to use her stint at the helm of the legendary fashion “bible” to highlight a collection of erse women breaking barriers – like climate activist Greta Thunberg, actress and activist Jane Fonda and New Zealandaposs Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. Vogueaposs editor in chief, Edward Enninful, explained: From the very beginning, we talked about the cover - whether she would be on it or not. “In the end, she felt that it would be in some ways a aposboastful thing to do for this particular project. She wanted, instead, to focus on the women she admires.    Meghanaposs critics claimed, of course, that she was having a dig at her sister-in-law, Kate, who featured on the front of Vogue in .

Princess Eugenie To mark her  birthday in , Andrew and Fergieaposs youngest daughter featured on the front cover of society magazine, Tatler.In the accompanying interview she talked about having major surgery to correct a spinal condition, her love of Radio  and Big Brother and why she, sister Beatrice and their Mum call themselves “the tripod.”   Prince Harry In  Harry appeared on the cover of GQ, to promote his Walking With the Wounded charity. He was just about to leave for Norway to train with a group of wounded servicemen preparing to trek to the North Pole. Harry joined them for the first five days of their gruelling, but ultimately successful walk. The Prince told GQ: aposaposThis extraordinary expedition will raise awareness of the debt that this country owes to those it sends off to fight - only for them towounded and scarred, physically and emotionally.

Ben Muscroft, , who weighed st lbs, was already embarrassed on the flight there, when he had to ask for a seatbelt extension and could not lower his meal tray. After the trip, Ben decided that “something had to change” and started attending a Slimming World group near his home in Hillsborough, Sheffield. Now, after slimming to st lbs, and going from a size XXXXXL to a ins waist, he has been crowned Slimming World Man of the Year.    And after meeting new girlfriend Karen Parker at the slimming class, they plan to go to China together so he can tackle the Great Wall again. “I was too unfit to walk any of it, which I really regret,” he said. Always the “big kid” at school, his weight ballooned on a diet of a bacon, sausage and egg sandwich for breakfast, fish and chips for lunch, and spaghetti bolognese or pizza for dinner, along with cans of cider or two bottles of wine. “Before I lost weight le was just hard. I couldn’t walk for more than five minutes,” he said. “I couldn’t even roll over in bed.” Ben, who once struggled to walk longer than five minutes, told how he never dreamed he would find anyone who wanted to be with him. Mr Muscroft said of the  trip to see his brother: “Just getting to China was a bit of a battle. “I had to ask for a seatbelt extension in front of the entire plane which wasn’t the greatest of starts.    “Then the tray table wouldn’t lie flat, so I had to eat my meals at a strange angle. It wasn’t a pleasant way to spend  hours. “Then when we got to China, my size meant I missed out on certain activities. I also became something of a talking point because many people had never seen anyone my size before - so the looks and stares were plentul. “When you weigh more than st even the simplest tasks really take it out of you. I couldn’t walk the short distance to Hillsborough football stadium without getting out of breath.” But after joining Slimming World his le has transformed. After being crowned top slimmer, Mr Muscroft now hopes toto China next year with his new girlfriend, Karen Parker, , and tackle the Great Wall of China.    The pair, who have known each other for  years, only got together after meeting in slimming class. Now they are hoping to see the world together. “I met someone special too – my girlfriend, Karen. At the size I was I’d grown used to the idea that I’d never find anyone who wanted to be with me. “My Slimming World group didn’t just change my le, it gave me a le I never thought I’d be lucky enough to have. “Next year I’m planning on ing to China with Karen so that she can meet my brother and I know this trip will be full of amazing memories. “We’ve got our whole future ahead of us and I can’t wait to see what’s in store.” Ben lost weight after switching to fruits and fat-free natural yogurt to start the day and a homemade coriander and mint chicken dish to end it.

behind. Just once have they overturned such a deficit after the first leg in Europe.It was in March  when they recovered from - down against Hungarian outfit Ujpest in the quarter-final of the European Cup Winners’ Cup.Former Dons midfielder Bell, who made  appearances for the club between  and , hopes Derek McInnes can mastermind a comeback against Rijeka like Sir Alex Ferguson did against Ujpest.Bell had starring roles in great Euro wins against the likes of Bayern Munich, Ipswich, Hamburg and Waterschei and started against Ujpest, which he also puts in the same bracket.The -year-old said: “The way the game went against Ujpest it was really exciting and it was great to be involved in. It was dferent to a lot of the other European games we had.“At - we were maybe ruled out, but the score meant it wasn’t impossible to come back.We started well and got the first and it meant we were right back in the tie.“So far this season Aberdeen have scored a lot of goals at Pittodrieso they’ll be confident of turning it round tomorrow.“If they can get the first goal they’ve got a good chance.“It’s goodthe fans are patient because evenit’s - with  minutes to go and Aberdeen get one, they’ve still got a great chance.“If Rijeka concede they’ll drop deeper and give away more chances, so it’s goodthe fans are patient. It will help the team.”Mark McGhee hit a hat-trick  years ago as Aberdeen saw off Ujpest in extra-time.Bell was a happy man to get through after taking stick from Fergie after the first leg and following a League Cup semi-final loss to Celtic.Having missed winning the Cup Winners’ Cup against Real Madrid in Gothenburg a year earlier, he was keen to retain the trophy.Bell, who won three Premier Division titles, two Scottish Cups and the European Super Cup with the Dons, added: “It was good that game, for me and the team.“The week before it we played Celtic in the second leg of the League Cup semi-final.“We lost - and I’d given away the penalty which put us out, the late Tommy Burns ed over my leg.“We did the double that year domestically of the Scottish Cup and Premier Division, so it was a downer because we could have had the treble.“So that wasn’t great and then away from home against Ujpest their first goal came from a free-kick.“I’d been in the wall and I thought ‘that’s not going anywhere near the goal’ and let it go by and it bent into the top corner and we lost -. Fergie gave me pelters saying I’d knocked us out of the two cups – the League Cup and Cup Winners’ Cup.“Against Ujpest at home we started really well and made a lot of chances.“It took patience, but we got the breakthrough in the first half and kept going scoring late on to take it to extra time and then winning it.“I was delighted to get through after the loss we’d had and that got us into the semi-finals again.“I’d missed the final the previous year with injury, so I was desperate to get to the final again.“Unfortunately we got beat off Porto in the semi-finals, which was a big blow to me because I’d played all the European games that year.“It’s a big ask for Aberdeen tomorrow, butthey get the first Rijeka will be jittery, the momentum of the tie changes and they’ll have a good chance.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/5d52812b68b4b1.32415324.jpg ","title":"leigh takes liverpoolinspiration ahead of croat clash","story":"Aberdeen full-back Greg Leigh is looking to last season’s Liverpool-Barcelona Champions League semi-final as motivation to dump Rijeka.The Croatians visit Pittodrie on Thursday with a - Europa League third qualying round lead from last week’s first leg.A miserable result on the Continent was compounded for NAC Breda loanee Leigh and his team-mates when they suffered a - Premiership reverse to St Mirren in soaking Paisley on Sunday.Nevertheless, the -year-old is convinced the Dons know what they need to do to fight their way to the Euro play-off round and keep their hopes of the lucrative group stages alive.He said: “Everybody who plays in these big competitions comes up against this at some point.“We’ve obviously come up against it really early.“We’re a strong group. Sunday was annoying, but we’ll get back stronger, kick on to Thursday and show what we can do.”Englishman Leigh pointed to May’s Anfield stunner when Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool overturned Barca’s - first leg lead with a - victory to reach the pinnacle of the European game.He said: “People wrote off Liverpool against Barca. But it’s a strong position to know what you have to do before you go into the game.“For example, a -, - scoreline is dficult for everybody, because you think, do we press  Do we sit off  Do we defend “But we know we need to score as many goals as possible – at least two – and not concede.“That’s a game plan we can go with and say ‘this is how we’re going to play to do that’.“It’s obviously a worry, but we just need to go out and do it.”Away in Rijeka, and at the Simple Digital Arena, Derek McInnes’ Dons have struggled to put the intricate attacking puzzle together.In Croatia, they kept the game goalless to half-time.However, against Jim Goodwin’s well-organised Saints, they were suckered after  minutes by Ilkay Durmus’ goal on the counter.One thing’s for sure, they need to come flying out of the traps at Pittodrie and find the flair they did in the - home victory over Georgians Chikhura Sachkhere.Leigh said: “No, we can’t . It’s something the manager has addressed after the game and that the players are aware of.“We know what we have to do as early as possible to give ourselves a chance.“Going away to a place like Rijeka, we didn’t show what we were about.“In the first game, we were obviously going in thinking not conceding was the ideal scenario.“But we know we have to show them what we’re about at Pittodrie, we’ve done that so farand we’ve got to do it again.”One problem on the horizon is the potential absence of Sam Cosgrove for the crunch meeting with Rijeka, as the hitman has a hamstring problem.Curtis Main was unable to fill Cosgrove’s sizeable boots in Paisley, but Leigh thinks inidual absences can’t be allowed to derail the team.Squad players like Scott Wright, Connor McLennan and new signing Zak Vyner were also below their best against Saints.Leigh said: “We need to be able to play without certain players. With injuries, suspensions, it happens.“With players coming into the team who haven’t had games, it maybe showed that they were a little rusty, but they can improve.“They’re good players, they’ve potential.“Heis important, but we have to be able to work without him as well.”The Eurpean qualying campaign has meant a hectic early season for McInnes’ squad, but it’s one of the reasons Leigh opted to move to the Granite City, so he won’t complain about the privilege.He added: “In a sense, it’s tough , but as players it’s exactly what you want to be doing.“You want to be playing in as many competitions and playing as much as possible. You need the mental side of things as well, but as players it’s what we train for.“We’re in every day to work hard and treat it like a game. It’s something we’re used to.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 14 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsBike scrambling fans out there of a certain age will be feeling nostalgic at the prospect of ato a track described as #one of the best in the world# later this month.Kilmartin is famous in the motocross world and mouths are watering at the prospect.Not that long ago,you had walked into a shop and asked for a bottle of water you would be offered fizzy French stuff or perhaps tonic or soda water.Plain drinking water  We had taps for that.A multi-million pound industry has #sprung# up, selling water to us in plastic bottles.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Some crews were hoping for rain but this year it wasn’t to be. Last year’s winner Bruce Edwards in the Darrian T GTR was favourite and since Bruce had not driven the car competitively since Mach   we all thought he would be a bit rusty.Bruce led from the start and set some impressive times throughout the two days but on the last stage he threw it all away and rolled the car as he clipped a large lorry tyre a mile from the finish line, unable to right the car and with the stage blocked the clerk of the course decided on the grounds of safety to cancel the final stage. This allowed Alistair Inglis in the lotus Exige and a previous Mach  winner to clinch the top spot.Class  had  STRC registered this year and new to class  was Tom Blackwood in the gorgeous yellow and Black Fiesta R+. Tom#s first event driving in anger and showed that with some tweaks here and there with suspension settings it’s a great car to drive. How well the car drives notwithstanding, there was a slight moment coming out of one of the tight sections onto the main runway when Tom ran wide and clipped a boundary fence damaging the front bumper of the car but kept the fence intact. Tom finished third Overall and second in class .John Rintoul in another Fiesta R on the back of the recent win at Crail was on it all weekend but just couldn’t clinch the win this year, John finished second overall and took the class win.Alan Wallace in the distinctive green and white Mitsubishi Evo finished a very well deserved th overall and third in class. Harry Chalmers was a Mach  virgin and loved every mile of the venue. Harry commented at the end of the event they we had no problems at all on day one and the car ran faultlessly all day to give him a real confidence boost to push on harder and let him get used to some new parts on the car. Harry kept it neat all day and came away with rd overall after day one.Day two was very fast. Fastest he’s probably been in the car to date with these faster stages suiting faster cars Harry just had to push on brake late and keep it tidy and with that being said the team dropped to th overall due to some of the quicker cars retiring out.Harry said: #I couldn’t be happier for how this event turned out for the team and are all delighted with the result and how far they have come.#Harry also managed the full two days on the same Hankook Tyres Finishing th overall.Alan Stark in the stunning Red Mitsubishi Evo had decided he was playing the long game and would drive accordingly. The plan went well and they played about with tyres trying to make them last for the two days. On the second last stage on the Saturday the manold gasket started to blow and he lost a fair bit of power mid stage. The service crew managed to bolt it up again but the long stages were killing it and it usually faded about  rds in each time.On Sunday he decided to push on a bit and of course it bit him. The interior mirror fell off and he became aware there was a car coming up behind after a merge but wasn’t sure how close. He decided to do the next lollipop and then see where he was on the straight but in his enthusiasm got to him and he understeered into the bales bouncing off them, hitting his bonnet. He also noticed the brake pads were rattling more than usual and it turned out they had lost a pin. The team had to improvise with spare tyre borrowed from Allan Wallace which didn’t quite fit but they wired it in and it lasted.Class  had  STRC registered crews this year and top spot and current championship leader in class went to Colin Gemmell in the Mark  Escort. Colin had a trouble-free run on both days and managed to finish the event th overall just  seconds behind Tom Blackwood and second in class.Alistair Inglis winner of the  Mach  stages kept just ahead all weekend. Nothing could touch his car which stuck to the road like glue.Inglis said: #Overall victory and a class win  Can’t get any better.#Robert Marshall in the Mark  Escort was looking forward to some decent results but an issue on day one with the car losing all its water put an end to any real chances and on day two an engine mount broke putting an end to what Robert described as a perfect weekend.Ross Auld was a welcomethe Mark  Escort and also managed a couple of days assistance in setting up the venue. Ross had managed to set some decent times on Saturday but late in the day the alternator belt snapped and took with it the dry sump belt causing the engine to cease. Ross loaded up the car and headed home and by the Sunday evening he had the engine out the car ahead of its rebuild.Class  saw four STRC registered crews compete in Kintyre this year and top of the list was Greg Inglis in the Lotus Exige. Greg exited the last stage on the Saturday and noticed the rear brake calliper hanging off. A call was made to Montrose where a spare part was removed from a car and the handover was done half way between Montrose and Machrihanish. Greg finished a respectful fth overall and took the class win.Second in class and th overall was Michael Harbour in the Mark  Escort, on the back of electrical problems that saw the team fail to finish the last round at Crail the team have now got the car singing on the stages. Michael didn’t report any issues during the weekend and brought the car home in one piece.Michael Robertson isn’t having the best of luck this season as the Honda Civic Type R driver reported issues with the CV joint that led to driveshaft and df failure but as usual the team loved the event and will be back for sure.Class , with eight registered STRC in class  the battles were all tensely close. Taking top honours in the class was Kyle Adam a full two minutes ahead of nearest class  car of Des Campbell. Kyle also managed a top  overall clinching th spot and despite some overheating at one point the car ran faultlessly doing his championship hopes no harm.Lochgilphead local, Jamie Miller in the C R Max loves the track and had the luxury of booking indoor servicing.

A change of driveshaft, ball joint, wheels and tyres seemed to cure the problem. With an early start on the Sunday morning the car was back on form. Loss of intercom on way to stage  and a half spin on stage  cost them a bit of time and after a few tweaks at service they were away again. The last stage of the day was cancelled resulting in a th overall and th in class.Alan Watt was again out in the green Saxo and finished th in class and st overall. A great result for the team with no damage or mechanical issues to report.Class  had four teams registered in the STRC this year at Mach  but only one managed to finish.

Goddards were granted permission to turn the house into a wedding venue with marquees in July , but Scottish Borders Council imposed strict conditions on the use after receiving strong objections from neighbours.One condition, that the planning permission was only valid for two years, was removed on appeal but the condition that only two rooms can be rented out in the mansion at a time has remained in place.The most recent application, submitted by Lanark-based Burrel Design Studios on behalf of the Goddards, seeks to lt this condition and allow guests to stay in the mansions year-round.A supporting statement accompanying the application reads: ldquoThe effect of the councilrsquos ruling means that year-round self-catering accommodation may legitimately be offered in the lodge, the white house and penthouse, and the rights bestowed under the planning acts mean that year-round bed and breakfast accommodation may be offered for a maximum of two bedrooms within Hartree

the historic structure from being a building lsquoat riskrsquo to being a fully restored historic building incorporating some contemporary elements, which have served to reconcile former unsympathetic earlier additions and have made the building fit for occupation in the current age.ldquoRegrettably, the limitations imposed by the planning status of the property at Hartree have restricted the opportunity for the current owners to accommodate visitors who have wished to re-establish their connection with Hartree House.ldquoThe opportunity to offer accommodation in Hartree House to guests will add signicantly to the attraction of Hartree as a venue and will assist towards the upkeep of the house and grounds.A castle, known as Hartree Tower, was present on the site by at least the th century, but was demolished in the late th century by Colonel Alexander Dickson, who rebuilt the current Hartree House in its place.In , the property was passed to Elizabeth Dickson after her brother

It is bounded to the west by Montgomerie Terrace.ldquoThe proposed new development will be accessed via a new access created off Montgomerie Terrace, with the two new houses towards the front of the site, which replace the existing ldquodoran pre-fab and former canoe shed, accessed off the B.ldquoThese proposed homes reflect high standards of design to ensure successful integration with the character of the local area, without damaging the design characteristics of the conservation area.ldquoThe materials, scale and height of the surrounding area have all been assessed to ensure the proposed development is in keeping with the existing housing.The plans attracted five objections relating to the height of the buildings in relation to nearby properties, and raised issues surrounding privacy and sunlight.However, at a meeting of Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday August , planning officers urged councillors to approve the plans.In a written submission to the committee, planning officer Julie Hayward writes: ldquoThe main issue with the development is the potential impact of the dwellinghouses proposed on plots five and seven on the light, privacy and outlook of Orchard House to the east due to the position of the proposed houses and dfering ground levels.ldquoThe agent has submitted a drawing to show the relationship between the three houses and section drawings showing ground levels.ldquoIn terms of the impact of the proposed house on plot seven, the proposed house would have two bedroom windows in the east elevation at ground floor level and would be on slightly lower ground. Applying the guidelines in the approved supplementary planning guidance, there would be no signicant loss of light or privacy to Orchard House from this property.ldquoIn terms of the impact of the house on plot five on Orchard house, the garage would be positioned on the eastern side of the proposed house and the decking is shown on the western side beyond the rear wing.ldquoThere would be a window and door to the garage and a window to a WC in the rear elevation, which are not considered to be habitable rooms. There would be a large glazed area in the rear wing serving the living room.ldquoThe house is on signicantly higher ground than Orchard House.ldquoAgain, when applying the approved guidance there would be no direct overlooking and no loss of privacy to the habitable rooms of Orchard House.Kelso councillor Simon Mountford said he did not object to the proposals, but wanted to see a design change: ldquoWhat we have here those very boring roof shapes, although I appreciate modern roofs do not have chimneys or anything to break them up a little bit.ldquoIrsquom wonderingwe could ask the developer to break up the roof lines with some new designs.Tweeddale West councillor Eric Small told the committee: ldquoIrsquom quite happy with the way itrsquos sited in this location, so Irsquom going to go with the officers on this one.

Built around a single, beautully menacing chord, which apparently symbolises the background radiation in our universe, the finale discusses the search for discovering a unying theory of everything.To quote Small from Imprints, As you travel through space, you are displaced, imagining time. You exist like a plant, you bloom and you grow, then wither and die. But the one card you play, genetically, is always an ace.

greater distance between the two developments would push the Barrel Law turbines outside of the topography which makes wind farms viable in this area.Appearing as part of ABO Windrsquos  of representatives, land and development consultant James Welsh told the reporter: ldquoIn our opinion we preserve the distinct identity of the two groups.ldquoThere are examples of wind farms being approved with similar distances between them but still being accepted as being clearly separate wind farms.ldquoTo insist on a greater separation would increase the effect of a cumulative effect between them.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning consultant, Dr Guy Wimble, said: ldquoI donrsquot dispute that they are identiable as separate elements, my issue is the effect of the wind farms on the landscape, and recognising that they are two dferent wind farms not one development.ldquoThe proximity of them makes this appear more of a wind farm landscape rather a landscape with wind farms.ldquoWhile I accept that separating the developments would make the wind farms seem more spaced out, by putting them closer yoursquod increase density.John Campbel QC, appearing on behalf of a group of objectors called Barrel Law Action Group, said: ldquoIf you pull the wind farms apart then clearly you increase the area of cumulative effect.ldquoIf you pull them together, yoursquore going

The pubs and cafes were busy so it was good for local businesses. Campbeltown is a Yes town and it was brilliant to have all these people come here.

are fortunate in Scotland to have a way out of such dficulties in the form of a Debt Arrangement Scheme , which is one of Scotland’s best-kept secrets.  It’s available from charitable organisations such as StepChange and from commercial debt advisers such as TC Debt Solutions, too.  It is a Scottish Government scheme that is legally binding and prevents creditors from taking further action against people who owe money.Set up back in  by the Scottish Government, the scheme allows people to freeze interest and charges on their debts and pay their debts off interest-free over a longer period of time.  This brings payments down to levels that people can afford and gives people the chance to get their lives back on track.  Interest and charges are simply written off.Apart from reducing debt, one of the best things about the DAS scheme is that it protects people from their creditors but is not a form of insolvency: people get to pay back their debt in an affordable way.  Lenders like the scheme because they know they will eventually get their money back – and borrowers like it because they don’t have to pay interest charges and they get longer to pay their debts off.  It’s a case of everyone wins.There’s plenty of information about the Debt Arrangement Scheme online at  www.aib.gov.uk debt-arrangement-scheme.  Thousands of people have used the scheme, but so many

summer tournament, winning the competition in , the one-off match was played in a good spirit, but it was the Pupils who found their ruthless streak to snatch a win in the closing minutes.Rhu, fielding a team with plenty of height and energy, featuring several former youth players from Dumbarton FC # and former teammates of Pupils’ playmaker Donald McCallum # threatened early on.At the other end, though, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils had first-half chances, with Scott Souden and youngster Calum McKillop both having one-on-one opportunities, but their efforts were stopped by the Rhu keeper.The second half exploded into le on the hour mark as former Sons youth Callum Scott made his mark for Rhu, turning inside his marker to curl a classy left-footed finish beyond stand-in goalkeeper Ellis Robertson.Undeterred, the Pupils searched for an equaliser, and were given the opportunity minutes later when a Rhu handball in the box was penalised by referee Thomas d’Alessandro.John McCallum, playing as sweeper in a back three with Fraser Wylie and Ross Souden, stepped up to send the keeper the wrong way and make it -.However, after a lapse in concentration, the Pupils conceded a second goal, a cleverly guided header from a near-post corner evading Robertson in goal.Then, with the -degree heat and high humidity making the game hard work for both teams, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils rallied to equalise.A sweeping move involving midfield trio Keith Mitchell, Stuart Crossan and Donald McCallum found Scott Souden, who made no mistake when bearing down on goal, lashing a right-foot shot past the Rhu keeper, to the delight of his teammates and the clutch of Campbeltonians making the long journey to spectate.Then, in the dying seconds, after seeing shots blocked at their own end, thanks to some vital interventions from Robertson, the Pupils stole a winner when midfield substitute Finn Scott was teed up by Scott Souden to slot the ball home low beyond the Rhu keeper, ensuring the visitors completed pre-season unbeaten.Pupils manager Campbell Robertson said: ‘The conditions were tough, but the boys played really well, and our shape was good too. We would like to thank Rhu Amateurs for their excellent post-match hospitality.’Meanwhile, the Pupils’ centenary season officially starts tomorrowwhen they host Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star at Kintyre Park, in the SAFL’s aptly named Centenary Cup, with a pm kick-off.And with two more Saturday group matches to follow in August, firstly away to Dunoon and then at home to Tarbert, the Pupils will look to continue their dazzling pre-season form once the competitive action begins.Photograph:"},{"url":null,"title":"simply the best for james","story":"James was + after nine holes and then proceeded to put together an excellent back nine to finish on +.Meanwhile Donald had gone to + n the front nine only to fall back on the inward nine and finished on +.Result: , James Williamson +  ,  Donald Brown +  ,  Bill Brannigan +  ,  Sandy Watson +  , Ken MacMillan +  , Robert Cook  +."},{"url":null,"title":"letter trying to keep everyone happy","story":"We, as the private landowners, have endeavoured throughout the years to make this historical area  as fully accessible to the general public as possible.Our use of introducing a few sheep to graze down the grass over certain months of the year is our preferred method but often, when summer visitors appear, we find the animals get frequently disturbed and distressed with human contact , and very often remove them in busy months to avoid any upset.The larger access gate is frequently left wide open, leading to constant rounding up of the livestock and  posing a danger to the passing road users, with even the odd complaint about our animals ‘deposits’  around the Footprints area coming into the equation too.Changing climate conditions have ensured that bracken and other plant species have increased in volume as every year passes and with worry about the decreasing insect population and visiting dogs perhaps being harmed by ingesting sprayed grass, we have never used any chemical solutions to help keep the undergrowth at bay.Strimming has been used on occasions  but this, too, has produced complaints from the public about the unnecessary removal of wild flowers and plants that provide food for the visiting bird and butterfly population.Sign posts are often needlessly torn down and often used to fuel beach fires and barbecues, with even the old, fragile, stone dyke surrounding the area being constantly clambered over,  rather than using the access gate, causing stones to be dislodged and even the wall being  deliberately dismantled, in order to use the stones to construct fire pits for outdoor cooking.In short, we’ve found there are never any easy answers when it comes to trying to keep everyone happy.Yours,Catherine Barbour,"},{"url":null,"title":"top artist jolomo finds inspiration on his doorstep","story":"The latest exhibition by John Lowrie Morrison, which opens on Saturdayat the Archway Gallery in Lochgilphead, concentrates on paintings of Crinan and Knapdale, landscapes found within a few miles of his Tayvallich home.Although John’s work is now sought out by collectors all over the world, he continues to exhibit every August at his #local# gallery # this will be his th solo exhibition at the Archway.

Children live in it quite naturally, but as adults we tend to withdraw from it.#I use high-key expressionist colour to express how I feel about the landscape.#I’ve been painting the area around me now for over  years, and the more I paint Knapdale, the more intensely I use light and colour to express my emotions for the landscape.#John worked for  years as an art teacher at Lochgilphead High School, then in art education with Strathclyde Region before leaving work to paint full-time in .His distinctive colourful landscapes quickly made him one of the Scotland’s most successful painters, with celebrities such as Sting, Madonna, Simon Le Bon and Gregor Fisher collecting his work.Wilma Meikle, who owns the Archway Gallery with her husband Iain, said: #We’re delighted that John has supported the gallery for all these years. His exhibition is always the highlight of our year and the new paintings are amazing.#It’s also really nice to have a show which is relevant to this area.

McDonnells Edinburgh Declaration caught the Scottish political world completely by surprise. The SNP couldnt believe their ears. I initially thought his remarks, especially the reference to ldquothe English Parliament, were just a badly-briefed UK politician talking off the cuff. But no. It is now apparently UK Labour policy to accept the SNPrsquos call for ldquoindyref. Gobs were well and truly smacked.Most smacked of all were the Scottish Labour Partys. Their leader, Richard Leonard, was left speechless. The Shadow Chancellor had directly contradicted Labours  manesto promise to oppose a repeat referendum. Only in March, Leonard made clear in an interview with the Daily Record, that a future Labour government would, like Theresa May, refuse any request for a ldquoSection  Order to trigger a legally-binding referendum on independence. No s no buts.:Scottish Labour registers lowest level of income in nearly two decadesNot any more, it seems. The Branch Office, as the SNP like to call Scottish Labour, has been told to back the policy of their deadly enemy. Christmas has come early for Nicola Sturgeon, without the turkeys.Many Scottish Labour MSPs were incandescent, as was the former Labour shadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray MP, who called McDonnell ldquoludicrous and demanded that he ldquoapologise to Richard Leonard , and reaffirm Labours policy of opposition to a referendum . Off-the-record comments from Scottish Labour figures were unprintable. Unionist Labour MSPs put together a statement ldquodeploring\" the change in policy. This backfired when it emerged they hadnt cleared it with Richard Leonards office.The Labour MP, Paul Sweeney, then added to the confusion by calling for a multi-option referendum including federalism, or devo max as it used to be called. This was once proposed by Alex Salmond in , and rejected by Labour and the Conservatives in favour of a binary Yes No question. Saying Labour were all over the place would be an insult to geography.So, what on earth is going on  Why was one of the key figures in the UK Labour party provoking a split on one of the most contentious issues in British politics  And right in the middle of the Brexit row. Labour is now ided every which way on the constitution: over Scottish independence and over leaving Europe. McDonnell has left the Scottish party an impossible task: trying to win Scottish votes without a policy on Scotland in a general election thats possibly weeks away.:Scottish Labour breaks silence over anti-semitism investigation by blasting \"biased\" BBCWhat seems to have happened is this. Labour, at a UK level, has started to think about forming much wider political alliances in future in order to defeat the rising tide of the right. This has been discussed by a number of Labour people, including the former BBC economics editor Paul Mason in his book Clear Bright Future.Mason has argues that Labour should abandon its traditional base in the white working class and the trades union movement, and look to creating a new progressive alliance, or ldquopopular front, with LGBT and BAME groups, and with other progressive political parties. Mason regards the SNP, unlike most other nationalist parties, as progressive and social democratic. On the eve of McDonnells Edinburgh interview Mason called infor ldquoa penalty-free independence referendum whenever Holyrood chooses.Im not saying that Paul Mason is writing Labour policy. Far from it. Many in the party regard him with suspicion, not least for appearing to abandon the working class. But it looks asthe Labour leadership has finally been persuaded that the SNP is not just a band of ldquotartan Tories, and that Jeremy Corbyn could do business with Nicola Sturgeon.Scottish Labour is anyway likely to be crushed again in the forthcoming General Wlection, while the SNP is in line for around  Westminster seats according to the polls. Its support would almost certainly be requiredLabour is to try to form a government, and McDonnells intervention could be an attempt to prepare the ground. Theres been no love lost between Corbyn and the mostly Blairite rump of the Scottish Labour Party, so he probably regards them as expendable.Not that Labour is admitting any of this. Indeed, the line from McDonnell in Edinburgh, echoed by the Shadow Business Secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey on Newsnight, is that Labour will not form any ldquocoalitions or pacts with anyone. Labour is still smarting from those Tory election posters in  which showed the then leader, Ed Miliband, in Alex Salmonds breast pocket. It is imperative for Labour, in England at least, to deny any hint of an alliance with the SNP.But Scotland is a dferent. A ing Labour government in Westminster would require the tacit assistance of the SNP, perhaps on a confidence and supply basis. At any rate, the UK party leadership seems to have decided that offering a referendum is a risk worth taking to help some future co-operation to happen. This is huge development and raises questions about whether Labour can still be called a Unionist party.Paul Hutcheon: the biggest threat to the Union is Scottish Labours disintegrationLast week felt asa dam has broken. After three years in which Scottish politics has been in suspended animation, suddenly everyone was talking about independence again. Even Conservative commentators like The Times Iain Martin are now calling for a referendum in five years. s Simon Jenkins believes independence itself is now unavoidable, and called on Westminster to plan for it now.Of course, a referendum may not deliver a Yes. The polls still show Scotland split down the middle on independence. But this is a vindication of Nicola Sturgeons cautious, constitutional approach to winning independence. It is a blow to her critics, who had been calling for an unauthorised referendum, or even UDI. The former SNP MP, George Kerevan, had been calling for mass civil disobedience to obstruct London transport. But this is a blow her internal critics will be happy to take for there is now a real possibility of a referendum in the next couple of years.That isLabour manages to defeat Boris Johnson ndash a big ask, perhaps, but far from impossible. There will likely be a vote of no confidence the Tory PM next month, and he will almost certainly lose. If Labour fails to form an alternative government in  days, then Johnson has to call a General Election. Hes hoping to delay polling day until after Brexit on October . But that is a risky tactic. Such constitutional jiggery pokery could easily alienate voters, many of whom are anyway unconvinced by Johnsons abilities.Just about anything could happen in the next few weeks. But what is not in doubt is that Scottish independence, or at least a referendum, is back on the agenda.

I have never doubted the long-term viability of an independent Scotland, but in the short-term I saw a fiscal hole with a policy  which would have made it bigger, not smaller. Too much risk, not enough reward.My choice was not an unusual one it is generally accepted through subsequent polling that uncertainty over the economic case was the central inhibitor to pushing the Yes campaign over the  per cent line.The prospect of a second independence referendum is now real. The  Scottish election is the most important in devolutionrsquos short history. The campaign will be, as good as, single-issue: should there or should there not be another referendum  If the pro-independence partiesa Holyrood majority, based on a clear, unambiguous and identical manesto pledge, then indyref  is in my view a democratic requirement. This is, effectively, the point acknowledged by both John McDonnell and David Mundell last week.How could Yes win  First, it could double-down on the - ldquocampaign ndash tack to the left, promote populist economics, arrange a big march, wave some Palestinian flags, Bairns Not Bombs, End London Rule and all the rest.Perhaps we are in an era where this can work. The recent record of prevailing economic theory winning political arguments is murky. The Yes campaign in  almost won despite the economic orthodoxy running contrary, as did Jeremy Corbyn in , and in , of course, the Leave campaign proved that relentless economic warnings can be ignored by a majority of the population.However this ndash a win based on a socialist fairytale ndash is no way to create a new country. We can damn private enterprise, wealth creators and taxpayers, but without them wersquoll find ourselves at the bottom of a social and economic pit in short order. This is student union politics, and high school economics. Eventhey could win this way, they shouldnrsquot.I spend most days with the Scottish business community. Their world is ruled by risk. And although, of course, this ies industry-to-industry, they generally see three primary political risks affecting their business. The first, and most concerning for them, is a Corbyn-led Labour government, the second is Scottish independence and the third is Brexit. Yes campaigners may wish that this order was radically altered, but that is the reality on the ground.:Mark Smith: How a Wings Over Scotland party could turn Yes to NoMost people in business ndash generally Remainers, generally No voters ndash are miles away from voting Yes, and every time they see the marchers and their flags and their populism on a Saturday afternoon, they move still further. They want to see some adults in the room.It is not as though the SNP doesnrsquot understand this. Andrew Wilsonrsquos Growth Commission was an effort to reassure this key demographic. And it was a very good one, primarily, in my view, because it acknowledged the economic reality of a small country in a big world, and did not bow to populism .But the Wilson report is one of very few items on that side of the balancing scale, still sitting high in the air, weighed down by the cacophony of evidence that the economic argument has not evolved.The SNP needs a long runway to prove that an independent Scotland can be an economic success story. There are a couple of obvious hurdles along the way. The first will come later this year, with the Scottish Governmentrsquos annual Budget. Since the  election ed a minority government, the SNP has relied on Green support for three budgets in a row. Each one has involved further concessions each one has pulled the SNP further left, particularly on tax. Not a lot just a little each time. The  budget will do the same.With the backdrop of a Boris Johnson government which might lower personal taxes in England, an expanding gap between Scottish and English taxpayers will really start to bite. Scots donrsquot like paying taxes any more than anyone  attempts to argue the contrary are delusional.The second hurdle is,anything, more dficult to tackle. Over the coming weeks, Westminster mathematics may present the SNP with an opportunity to replace Boris Johnson with Jeremy Corbyn infor a second independence referendum. This will be tempting. Indeed, it will likely be impossible to resist, and I am not suggesting that it should be.:Marianne Taylor: Gordon Brown insults us all by claiming independence is an evilHowever, this action would have a consequence.

Scottish Coastal Archeology and the Problem of Erosionwill also be on hand to help.:Youth climate strikes: Show the world we stand up for planet EarthThe young people will be encouraged to set their own research parameters and explore issues that matter most to them and their communities from climate breakdown, industry pollution and the impact on wildle and oceans.Amy Calder, Senior Policy and Research Officer, YouthLink Scotland said:\"Watching Greta Thunberg and young people across the world marching through the streets to fight for a sustainable future, showing adults that climate change is real and needs tackling now, has been extremely inspiring.\"It also highlights the power of youth voice in holding adults to account for actions that will affect them and future generations.\"Early next year the project will launch a youth-led national campaign to highlight the damaging environmental and and social impacts on sea-side communities.The initiative launches at the beginning of the Year of Coasts and Waters  where Scotlands waters will be celebrated with a programme of activity designed to inspire both visitors and locals to explore and experience the countrys unrivalled shores.Well established annual festivities such as the Scottish Traditional Boat Festival at Portsoy and Crail Food Festival will be joined by The Fe Regatta, an expanded Clydebuilt Festival, and Edinburgh International Film Festival will present Scotlands Shores, featuring classic film screenings and a special outdoor coastal experience.The RSPB will celebrate Aberdeens status as one of the

interested in environmental issues and itrsquos fantastic that through this new project, they will be supported by youth workers and environmentalists to investigate the impacts of pollution and global warming right on their doorstep.\"As a coastal community there are a iety of environmental consequences for young people to consider, including coastal erosion, the predicted rise in sea levels, the need for marine conservation in the light of climate change and the effect of litter, in particular single use plastics.\"The findings of the Young Heritage Researchers will be shared at a national event in the Storytelling Centre in Edinburgh in July , and then local story-sharing events in their communities.Ms Calder said: \"Itrsquos fitting the research report is unveiled at the centre, as it is through the stories of first-hand accounts of damage to our coasts and waters that will bring communities together to fight against climate change.\"The On Our Wave Length project is another vital investment in understanding the impact of climate change and joins other projects in Scotland such as the beneficiaries of the latest round of Scottish Natural Heritage rsquos Green

farmers looking to recycle plasticThe fund aims to tackle socio-economic issues such as poor health and high unemployment by creating and improving greenspaces in communities as well as attempting to mitigate effects of global climate change.The seven latest projects will improve habitats and bioersity, transform unused land, tackle flood risk and create new active travel routes, community gardens and play areas in Glasgow, Bishopbriggs and Dunfermline.SNH Chief Executive Francesca Osowska said: ldquoWe know that connecting people with nature makes them happier and healthier and itrsquos great to see this funding delivering that in our most deprived areas.ldquoIn addition to the many social and economic benefits, improving our urban greenspace can also help us adapt to and mitigate climate change.ldquoThis funding will help us create a nature-rich future for everyone in Scotland, part of the solution to the climate emergency facing us all.The EU-backed Green Infrastructure Fund is part of the Scottish Governmentrsquos European Regional Development Fundprogramme and is being delivered in two phases.Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: ldquoThis investment will bring signicant benefits to communities across seven more urban areas, repurposing and revitalising land to create green spaces and infrastructure.ldquoCrucially, this funding will also help address the impacts of climate change by improving bioersity, managing flood risk, and reducing pollution, while promoting new low carbon lestyle choices and active transport options in the heart of our

has said using any type of mobile phone while driving had potentially catastrophic consequences and warned that current laws give the \"misleading impression\" that hands-free options are safe.And the MPs called for more severe penalties ldquocommensurate with the risks, as road deaths linked to phone use have risen steadily over the past decade.A public consultation on the proposal should be published by the end of , the cross-party group said.It is understood the Scottish Government would support a ban on hands-free mobile phones from a road safety point of view as long as the proposal is backed with evidence and proper impact assessments.It comes as it emerged research found that Scotland is a UK hotspot for distracted driving offences.Court penalties doubled when tough mobile phone driving laws were introduced in March, .And research using freedom of legislation carried out for the motor dealers Peter Vardy revealed that in around nine months after the new legislation, there had been , recorded offences since March across  constabularies in the UK.Scotland was said to have been the worst region, accounting for , of these.A separate survey at around the same time to determine the places that are the worst offenders found that came top with nearly three in four admitting to using their phones behind the wheel. This was closely followed by London where % said they used their phones while driving, as did % of Glaswegians, % in Cardf and % of Birmingham drivers.The safest place for other drivers and pedestrians appears to be Southampton, where just one in twenty of drivers admitted to using their phones. While people in Bristol , Manchesterand Nottinghammade up the four lowest cities for mobile phone use behind the wheel.:Lorry driver caught checking his phone before fatal crash jailed for five yearsIn September, last year, -year-old recovery driver David Shields who was caught on camera checking his phone prior to a fatal crash was jailed for five years.The driver crashed into -year-old Yvonne Blackmans car in a line of traffic on the A in Dumfries last February.He had previously admitted a charge of causing the mother-of-fours death by dangerous driving.Footage captured Shields, of Drongan, East Ayrshire, focusing on his phone for a full  seconds in the lead-up to the fatal crash.Brake, the road safety charity said research showed using a hands-free phone can impair a driver in the same way as a hand-held device and so it makes sense that the law treats these acts equally.A Brake spokesman said: ldquoThe number of distracted driving offences in Scotland is cause for concern and highlights that there is still much work to be done regarding the dangers of phone use behind the wheel.:Time to ban phones in schools: Cross-party MSPs call for Holyrood investigationldquoWe need urgent clarication of the law on using hand-held mobile devices while driving, including closing loopholes which treat sending or receiving data dferently.\"The current law also provides a dangerous  impression that it is safe to use a mobile phone with a hands-free kit - it is not. All phone use behind the wheel is dangerous, and we need the law to reflect this by banning the use of hands-free devices.\"It is also true that a law is only as strong as its enforcement and so we want to see further resources provided to the police to make sure there is an effective deterrent to the menace of mobile phone use behind the wheel.A Scottish Government spokesman said: ldquoWhile the power to legislate in this area is reserved to the UK Government, we are clear that road safety is a priority and we recognise that driving while distracted puts the driver and other road users at greater risk.ldquoWe continue to support behavioural change and marketing campaigns through Road Safety Scotland. The message from us and all road safety partners is clear - do not risk your safety or the safety of others by using a mobile phone behind the wheel of a car."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10270163.jpg?type=article-full","title":"tennents-maps-scotlands-top-15-pubs-view","story":"A new guide to Scotlands most scenic pubs has been launched in a bit to introduce beerlovers to a pint with a view.But anyone wishing to finish the trek will have to get their walking boots on and have some time to spare , as it criss-crosses the country for  miles by land and sea and none of the bars are exactly local.However, when they have called last orders on the mammoth trip, they will have visited some of Scotlands most stand-out hostelries, including a -year-old coaching inn, a pint aboard a boat on Loch Katrine and a bar located within the stunning glens of the Cairngorms National Park.The map was Tennents ideaThe lsquoViewPintsrsquo map, celebrates  pubs and bars across the country with the most spectacular views as judged by brewers Tennants -

Itrsquos just something that I wanted to do. Irsquove been trying to keep it a bit of a secret, but Irsquove been enjoying the process of doing it.Scots of any vintage will have little trouble knowing the song from which it takes its name. Written in , it was recorded two-years later, and amid a plethora of cover versions, popped up to some fame on the  Tennentrsquos Lager advert by Frankie Miller, reprised by MacLean himself years later.But while it might be one of Scotlandrsquos ldquoother national anthems, itrsquos clear for MacLean that it means so very much more. ldquoI wrote the script myself, I wrote the story, which is a nice thing to do at my stage of le after all these years as a travelling troubadour and songwriter, he says. ldquoIrsquove got so many songs, therersquos  songs Irsquove written over the years and Irsquove got this great story ndash itrsquos a love story ndash and itrsquos cool.He revealed that it was his time spent in Glasgow, as musical director at the Citizenrsquos Theatre for the hugely successful A Scots Quair trilogy staged by Glasgowrsquos TAG theatre company in  and featuring Sunset Song, that lay the foundations for his move into musicals.He said: ldquoI thought to myself, I know how this works, I can visualise a stage production Irsquom performing all the timeI know how audiences work, I know the songs that Irsquove written over the last  years and the ones that work onstage with people, so itrsquos great to just make a story and bring all those songs into that story.While he wants to keep the core theme under wraps ndash its worth waiting for ndash he hints: ldquoItrsquos amazing that a song that I might have written for myself, thatyou put it in another situation, it changes the whole dynamic of the song.And he hopes it will strike a chord with a new generation of fans, as well as those who love the song and his other bodies of work already.He said: ldquoCaledonia was a homesick song. I wrote it when I was on a beach in Brittany in France. I finished it and was staying in a youth hostel with three friends who were Irish, we were busking basically in the streets around France.ldquoWersquod jump on a train, see a nice town and get off, did a few wee gigs and I finished the song off.ldquoI remember going back to the youth hostel where we were staying, singing it to them, we were all that homesick anyway, and we left the next day.ldquoThe first time I ever performed it was in West Berlin. Irsquod gone back to Germany and was touring around and I didnrsquot do many of my own songs at that time, I did a lot more traditional songs, a bit of fiddle, and I snuck this song in and the audience just loved it. Even way back then, I was  maybe, I turned around and said wersquoll keep that in the set.And he is proud he did. ldquoCaledonia is only a tiny, little part of what I do. But therersquos something about it that became part of common culture which is fascinating and which is a great thrill for a songwriter to have something that is part of it ndash that is sung at football games, played at Scottish weddings, is played at funerals, you hear buskers singing it in the streets. I have incredible stories about it, you canrsquot invent that.

Festival because I had a long history with bagpipes. When I joined The Tannahill Weavers when I was , thatrsquos when that whole piping revolution was happening. I remember when the band Alba told us they were getting their Highland bagpipes out, we were all ndash you cannae get your Highland bagpipes out in a folk band because they were B flat and what have you. But these guys worked out how to do it.ldquoThe concert is more of a solo concert with me touching my cap to the piping tradition. Irsquove always liked to use whistles and bagpipes, rather that saxophones ndash because they are Scottish.MacLean says Scotland is in rude health, culturally, shaking off the stereotypical caricature of the Harry Lauder years, adding: ldquoTherersquos a lovely, modern, sophisticated image that we have now and Irsquod like to think Irsquove been part of that whole cultural revolution that began to happen around  years ago.Next month he turns , but he laughs: ldquoIrsquom busier this year than Irsquove ever been.

I was on a beach in Brittany, France. I finished it and was staying in a youth hostel with three friends who were from Ireland, we were busking basically in the streets around France.Wersquod jump on a train basically, see a nice town and get off, did a few wee gigs and I finished the song off.I remember going back to the youth hostel where we were staying, singing it to them, we were all that homesick anyway we left the next day. I went back with then to Northern Ireland and the first time I sang it basically was at a party outside Belfast somewhere.The first time I ever performed it on stage was in West Berlin. Irsquod gone back to Germany and was touring around and I didnrsquot do many of my own songs at that time, I did a lot more traditional songs, a bit of fiddle, and I snuck this song in and the audience just loved it.Even a way back then, I was  maybe, I turned around and said wersquoll keep that in the set.Caledonia is only a tiny, little part of what I do.But therersquos something about Caledonia that became part of common culture which is fascinating and which is a great thrill for a songwriter to have something that is part of common culture ndash that is sung at football games, played at Scottish weddings, is played at funerals, you hear buskers singing it in the streets.I have incredible stories about Caledonia, you canrsquot invent that.People have tried to make anthemic songs ndash and they donrsquot work. People choose their own anthemic songs, and I donrsquot know why Caledonia has seeped into this.Therersquos probably not a night goes by and therersquos not a drunk standing somewhere singing Caledonia.DOUGIE MACLEAN ON THE MEANING BEHIND CALEDONIAWhen you are young, you donrsquot have the baggage of le so you are a wee bit more honest in what you say and in what you write.I mean, I was just really very homesick and I wrote what was there.If I tried to write it now, I probably couldnrsquot, because I would be saying lsquooh no, thatrsquos too sentimentalrsquo or whatever.Caledonia is a big song over in Ireland, itrsquos a big song whenever Irsquom over in Europe, itrsquos about the sense of belonging that it has.It encapsulates your own sense of belonging, for me I would make it Scotland.But therersquos something  in that song that people identy with in terms of their own sense of belonging.I donrsquot know where it is today.Therersquos a lot of political turmoil, Irsquom not sure anybody knows how it will turn out. I try to sometimes to imagine whatrsquos going to happen, where itrsquos going to go, but I canrsquot.But I think having songs like Caledonia help people keep their cultural sense of identity, and an identity can be all-encompassing too.TURNING HIT SONG CALEDONIA INTO DOUGIE MACLEANrsquoS FIRST MUSICALItrsquos a musical - Irsquom in the middle of working on it. Caledonia the Musical. Itrsquos just something that I wanted to do.Irsquove been trying to keep it a bit of a secret, but Irsquove been enjoying the process of doing it.I wrote the script myself, I wrote the story, which is a nice thing to do at my stage of le after all these years as a travelling troubadour and songwriter.Irsquove got so many songs, there are  songs Irsquove written over the years and Irsquove got this great story ndash itrsquos a love story ndash and itrsquos cool.I was musical director years and years and years ago for TAG theatre company here in Glasgow at the Citizens Theatre for a three play series, A Scots Quair, and so I learned quite a lot in the process of being involved with that because we had music on stage as well.Irsquove been using a lot of what I learned there.I thought to myself, I know how this works, I can visualise a stage production Irsquom performing all the time for I know how audiences work, I know the songs that Irsquove written over the last  years and the ones that work on stage with people, so itrsquos great to just make a story and bring all those songs into that story.Itrsquos amazing that a song that I might have written for myself, thatyou put it in another situation, it changes the whole dynamic of the song.INFLUENCING SCOTLANDrsquoS CULTURAL IDENTITYScotland has a very modern vision of itself, a modern, progressive vision of its national identity which is kind of unusual.Irsquom glad that Scotland has developed it that way.Irsquom very proud of our Scottish Parliament, I think itrsquos very progressive and modern and I think Scotlandrsquos is a great international brand ndash people love Scotland, they love the whole concept of Scotland, I donrsquot know how politically it will all fold out because it gets very complicated.Itrsquos not a black and white thing anymore. There have been a lot of things ndash a lot of lies ndash said. People are maybe looking at ita bit more.Even culturally, Irsquove seen a huge dference in my letime the way that Scottish people identy themselves as Scottish.Back when we were kids we were embarrassed to be Scottish, it was that old buffoon with the wiggly stick and the hairy legs, the Harry Lauder caricature of being a Scot, but I think people arenrsquot anything like that ndash therersquos a lovely, modern, sophisticated image that we have now and our culturersquos been part of that.Irsquod like to think Irsquove been part of that whole cultural revolution that happened  years ago where it went away from being music hall to people writing their own stuff, we werenrsquot playing on the caricature of being Scottish, we were creating a fantastic cultural revolution ndash not just the folk guys, but the rock guys and everyone .DOUGIE MACLEAN ON SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE AND EUROPEI think Scots are more confident in being Scottish, and maybe that will inevitably lead to independence.I donrsquot how that journey will go, but Irsquod like to see it myself because I believe in small things.I believe in independence, but part of a bigger thing.And itrsquos been like that in my own le, Irsquove been very independent in how Irsquove gone about things ndash I have my own company, my own studio, so I was in control of my own destiny.But without the bigger thing, it would be very dferent.Irsquom independent but in a big music scene. I think we need to be part of that bigger thing .:Dougie MacLean: lsquoI want people to be talking about Live by the Loch in next  yearsI think part of cultural identity is the brand, thatrsquos the glue thatkeeps the world together ndash everybody loves their cultural identity, andyou can invent one that encompasses and brings in other peoplersquos cultural identities too, then you have a modern Scotland that is quite dferent from the one that my dad would have imagined.Thatrsquos what makes my songs dferent from James Taylor songs because he writes them from an American perspective, but Irsquom not singing about traditional things, I write about human things.DOUGIE MACLEAN ON BEING A SCOTTISH MUSICAL PIONEERWhen we set up the record company, I built a wee recording studio, and nobody was doing it at the time. It was me and Ossian, another folk group, who were a great help.It was vinyl in these days, and you couldnrsquot get vinyl cut in Scotland, so I remember the first record I made up in Butterstone was a fiddle record and I had to get on an overnight Stagecoach to London, to Soho where they had the cutting rooms, with the master tapes under my arms, to get the vinyl cut on this thing.Thatrsquos where I learned that they used a diamond needle on the cutting machines, but they only used the new diamond needles for the big acts and when it was worn they put it on an old machine at the back and cut all the independents with it.People donrsquot realise thatrsquos how I did it.It was the early days of Stagecoach which is from Perthshire, and they had two old buses.The driver would stop halfway down, about Carlisle somewhere, and get this gin box out with his Thermos flask and come round to give everybody a cup of coffee and a sandwich that his we had made ndash that was it then, though Stagecoach are huge now of course.But thatrsquos how we had to do it.The CD has become devalued because it is so easy to make. But back then people said oh, yoursquoll never be able to do it, yoursquoll never be able to stay in Dunkeld, yoursquoll have to go to London, New York or even Glasgow or Edinburgh.But I was dogged, I said no, Irsquom going to stay here, and I made it.I live in my old school, the school that I went to, and my dad went to. Itrsquos a great story.I am on facetime a lot with my son Jamie who produces my records now, it all ties together. I like that. Itrsquos not an ego-driven lestyle, I keep bees, I collect Singer sewing machines, wersquore all surviving and itrsquos just our lives. Itrsquos what we do.TRYST AND DOUGIE MACLEAN PERFORMING AT PIPING LIVE! IN GLASGOWOne of the things about the TRYST concert, it was really nice of the guys to ask me to come along and be part of the Piping Live! Festival because I had a long history with bagpipes.I joined The Tannahill Weavers when I was , thatrsquos when that whole piping revolution was happening.I remember when the band Alba told us they getting their Highland bagpipes out, we were all ndash you cannae get your Highland bagpipes out in a folk ban,d because they were B flat and what have you.But these guys worked out how to do it and I ended up touring American with wee Alan on bagpipes, and I had my relationship with young Gordon Duncan who played on all my records when he was a youngster.This was all before it became really well established.The concert is more of a solo concert with me touching my cap to the piping tradition.I did a tour of America one time with Kathy Mattea who had just won a Grammy at the time, and she had come to my studio and we had recorded lsquoFrom a Distancersquo and Gordy had played a little bit of pipes on it for her.So when I went to America and did the special guest on her tour, she said lsquooh, I wish we could do that with the bagpipesrsquo so I learned the part of small pipes ndash it was the only part I could ever learn to play ndash and I walked onto the stage playing that. I felt a fraud.But I did it, Irsquom just hoping someone has a recording or photograph somewhere.DOUGIE MACLEAN ON PERFORMING IN GLASGOWI love Glasgow, I come down a lot. I did a solo show there recently which was brilliant and Irsquove done shows over the years, all the theatres around here and I worked at the Citizens.I remember coming down here as an eight-year-old, my uncle Roddy liked in Castlemilk, and coming down from where I lived up in Dunkeld, I might as well have been going to the moon.It was so dferent for me. I love living in the country, Irsquom a country boy, but I have very fond memories from Glasgow.Irsquove had great fun in Glasgow, with the festivals and the shows that Irsquove done ndash but a couple of night ago I played in Crieff, the night before that up in Findhorn on the north coast, and on Stornoway at An Laantair ndash it was fantastic.Irsquom a very positive person, I like all kinds of music, I like the creative process.The last couple of years Irsquove been doing solo concerts, Irsquove ed back to the essence of what I do.Irsquove done a lot of collaborating, Irsquove done orchestra stuff, with bands and things, but now Irsquom doing these shows solo and itrsquos great because I get this relationship with the audience going which you just canrsquot get in collaboration.I love that, I tell stories and get the audience to sing, I love that side of what I do.This weekendrsquos show at the Royal Concert Hall will be a bit like that, I donrsquot like formal concerts, itrsquos a Dougie Maclean concert with a bunch of my songs and a bunch of my stories and a bit of whistle here, a bit of bagpipes there, it is a great privilege to be asked to come down and be part of it.DOUGIE MACLEAN ON FILMING HIS LIFE STORYThe whole world is changing. I do a wee bit of photography and video.Irsquom in the process of cataloguing my le in video for the kids.My son has got his drone licence, Irsquove got a drone, my video cameras, my GoPros and Irsquom going to go out and visit all the places I grew up in.If I wait about trying to get the media to do it, theyrsquore not interested in me at all, then there will be no record of what Irsquove done, my le, unless I do it myself.I enjoy it, itrsquos for my grandkids, not really for anything .Buttherersquos any other value, then therersquos a big old internet out there, so people will be able to see it for themselves.DOUGIE MACLEAN TURNS  YEARS OLD ON HIS BIRTHDAY IN SEPTEMBERIrsquom busier this year than Irsquove ever been. Irsquove just come back from Europe. But people say to me ndash when are you going to retire But I remember a famous American actor said, lsquoIf yoursquove got a job, you retire,itrsquos your workndash you just keep doing itrsquo and I thought that was a quite good way of describing what I do.As long as Irsquove got a voice and I can drive and travel, Irsquoll keep on doing it.I love the people, Irsquove got a fantastic group of fans who appreciate what I do, who will come to my shows, and are great fun to be with for an evening.There are two paths you can take as a musicianyou want your face on the front of Q magazine, you sign a deal with a big, major record company, then you might have a bit of fame for two or three years, then you go back to being a taxi driver.Oryou just enjoy playing music, you set up your own independent publishing label, and you go out and do gigs, all kinds of gigs, and thatrsquos whatrsquos been lucky with me.Irsquove managed to have this longevity ndash Irsquom turning  as you say ndash and I think Irsquom getting better as I get older.Even my own songs I sang  years ago Irsquom doing better now for some reason, with that older gravitas that you get.Therersquos something about not being stressed out about it all.Irsquom not at that place in my le where Irsquom worried about reviews, every year I have now is a bonus for me. Irsquove got my family and the kids, Irsquove paid off my house, Irsquom in a good place.Itrsquos an amazing place to be as a musician."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10272102.jpg?type=article-full","title":"1m-whisky-sauce-e-made-country-fair","story":"Foodies and whisky aficionados can delight their taste buds when the one-of-a-kind whisky sauce is served at Galloway Country Fair this weekend.The sauce, made from cask number one of Annandale Distilleryrsquos first unpeated single malt Man orsquo Word, will be used for a recipe in the Fairrsquos Galloway Demo Kitchen.This will be the first and only use of the whisky, named after Robert Burns, before it is out away to mature for a decade.

Internal features such as stone benches have also been found along either side.The hall is oriented towards the sea and finds include steatite , pottery, a bone spindle whorl and a fragment of a Norse bone comb.The find provides tantalising evidence of the earliest phases of inhabitation on this farm and settlement mound which may well have been inhabitated for over , years.It provides another piece to the ,-year jigsaw along this archaelogy rich stretch of coast as Westness in Rousay — described as the #Egypt of the North#.A team of archaeologists from the University of the Highlands and Islands Archaeology Institute, Rousay residents and students have been digging at the site for a number of years, investigating the later stages of the farm complex and its waste heaps with a particular focus on past diet, farming and fishing practices.Although only partly uncovered at this stage, the Skaill hall has parallels with other Norse halls excavated in Orkney, such as Snusgar, and where in Scotland.The excavation is part of the Landscapes of Change — Archaeologies of the Rousay Clearances and Westness Estate project which is exploring the Skaill farmstead.The present farm at Skaill dates to the th and th centuries and was part of the Rousay clearances during the mid-th century.The name Skaill suggests the site was home to a Norse hall or drinking hall, and was a high status site.Westness is mentioned in Orkneyinga saga as the home of Sigurd, a powerful chieftain, so it was always likely that a Norse settlement was located somewhere at Skaill.Earlier structures have been found below the present farm during previous seasons, and this season explored more of the Norse phases of the site.Three dimensional models of the farmstead can be found here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Please feel free to contact us with any questions by phoning  ,# said those involved.A spokesperson for the project went on to say: “A huge thanks to all the landowners who have helped us by agreeing the essential land access we need to get started. With their support together we can protect Orkney’s unique wildle for future generations.”The traps will be laid around  metres apart in preferred stoat habitat, which may include some road verges. They will be checked regularly by the project staff.The Orkney Native Wildle Project is a partnership between Orkney Islands Council, Scottish Natural Heritageand RSPB Scotland. Following three years of development generous support for the project has been provided by, the Heritage Lottery Fund and EU Le, providing a combined grant of £. million for the duration of the five-year project.Stoats are native to the UK Mainland but not to Orkney, where they were first recorded in . Since then the population has increased rapidly and is now fully established and widely-distributed throughout Mainland Orkney, Burray and South Ronaldsay.

Sales will be licensed from August   until October  .

Now, licensed sellers from Orkney will have a chance to develop the market for their product and people can try goose for themselves, on Orkney, and across Scotland.“Wild geese are an important part of Scotland’s nature, but their rapid rise in numbers has been challenging for farmers and crofters. Striking the balance between conservation, farming and hunting can be dficult. Our goal is to give farmers and crofters the tools they need to safeguard their crops, enabling them to control goose numbers sustainably, and sell goose meat for profit.”Until now, meat generated by the Orkney resident greylag goose project could only be sold locally by retailers based on Orkney.SNH is working to secure longer-term arrangements for the sale of resident greylag goose meat in Scotland.

Richard Leonard hadn’t got the memo. He rushed out a release restating his own take on party policy, but still the sht was reasserted by Corbyn’s right-hand man.Bizarrely, it suggests a further extension of the policy that cost Labour so heavily at the European election: the doctrine of ‘constructive ambiguity’.: John McDonnell owes Richard Leonard apology over thoughtless independence ramblings – Ian Murray MP: Three weeks of Boris Johnson - and Scotland has had enoughIt’s a bit of a mouthful but constructive ambiguity basically boils down to trying to play both sides at once. Initially it only applied to Brexit. It stood as a means of triangulating a position which would please both their Leave-voting constituencies in England and reassure their Remain voters in ­metropolitan London and university towns. It failed. Spectacularly.Labour learned the hard way that, when it comes to constitutional politics, you cannot ride both horses. They had tried to convince Leave voters that they were a party wedded to honouring the referendum result whilst simultaneously reassuring Remainers that they were going to block Brexit. They forgot one key factor: both groups were hearing both sets of ­messages and didn’t believe either.The softening of their policy towards a second indyref feels like the same gambit, trying to appeal to Yes voters whilst maintaining an ostensibly pro-UK  to retain their pro-Union supporters. Without an urgent course correction, it could bring about their ruin.Over the past four years, Labour have been quietly conducting a post-mortem into why they were all but wiped out in Scotland in the  ­general election. They believe they came adrt of substantial ­sections of their base when the SNP started to win over traditional Labour demographics to the Yes cause. That feeling that “Labour isn’t on my side” was compounded, they believe, by images of Labour politicians sharing ­s with the old enemy – the Conservative Party.The result of that post-mortem was a two-stage policy sht, the first, uttered several times in recent months, that Labour would not campaign alongside the Conservatives in any future independence referendum. The second was the withdrawal of hostility to that referendum at Westminster.There are already huge signs that this isn’t playing well among their remaining supporters. After offending their ultra-Remain core with ambiguity over Brexit, they are causing equal or even graver offence to the substantial wing of the party who loathe the ision that will come with a second border poll.Moderate Labour activists stared on in disbelief. That reaction was elegantly captured by Duncan Hothersall, a respected Labour activist and blogger, when he described his party in Scotland as the political equivalent of a ghost in the movie The Sixth Sense – “Most people don’t even notice it, and it doesn’t realise it’s already dead.”Several journalists have already told me of their private expectations that my own party, the Lib Dems will benefit handsomely from being the only party to stand full square behind Scotland’s place in the UK and Scotland’s place in the EU.That may be the case, but I take no pleasure in Labour’s sht. A plurality of voices making the positive case for our place in both unions is absolutely vitalwe are to save either.

Tom wants a just transition, but maximum extraction of fossil fuels is simply incompatible with keeping the global temperature down to a level that is safe.“Tom talks about transitioning jobs, but to secure and grow green jobs like the ones he and I have, we need to start that transition from oil and gas now.“The climate emergency requires us to look at the science and be responsible about this. That doesn’t mean suddenly turning off the oil supply, but it does mean we need to start building for the future now, not waiting until we’ve extracted every last drop of oil.”Scottish Green candidate Debra Nicolson said she was #pleased Tom Wills recognises the climate emergency, but Shetland needs to start building a sustainable future and create new jobs, not rely on a dwindling resource that is damaging the planet.“The SNP can talk about a just transition, but they need to back it up with action. Whatever his personal values, as an SNP backbencher Tom will be whipped to vote for maximum fossil fuel extraction and continuous growth in high-carbon transport.“If elected, I’ll push for a Scottish Green New Deal that will secure our future.”OMG!

The results are projects which genuinely improve the lives of today#s residents # as well as visitors # and leave a legacy for future generations. What is even more remarkable is the fact these projects are achieved with very little access to loans. The good work of the community trusts is achieved through dogged determination to raise funds within the community combined with seriously clever navigation of the minefield of grant applications. By steadily securing the funds from a myriad public pots and local activities the trusts ensure each project is not only affordable now, but sustainable for generations to come.In Staffin # home to the iconic Old Man of Storr # the local community trust has raised over £, to upgrade existing footpaths and create new ones. There will be new parking, #welcome# structures and interpretation boards at all sites. The whole project will result in what the trust is calling #Skye Ecomuseum# which will encourage visitors to spend more time and therefore more money in Staffin.In the north west of Skye, the Glendale Trust covers a huge area that attracts , visitors a year # many travelling the long and winding single track road to the top five hotspot of Neist Point.The trust, under the leadership of Tim Hunter-Davies and three new directors, is working hard to develop sustainable facilities for the community and tourists. They have taken ownership of Meanish Pier and the foreshore, creating opportunities for local residents and regional businesses alike. It will be run commercially and provide income to enable the Trust to invest in further sustainable community projects.Glendale # which was the subject of Scotland#s first community buyout back in  # is rich in history and the trust is also looking to develop projects that preserve and share the story of the area, as Tim Hunter-Davies explains: #As well as being instrumental in land reform in the last century, Glendale has a rich heritage stretching back through the centuries. A steamer used to sail daily from Loch Dunvegan and was used as a point to transport many people away from Scotland during the Highland clearances. We want to preserve and share our history with the community and visitors.#In south Skye is the Sleat Community Trust. It has been working hard to provide and improve leline services for the community that also benefit visitors arriving and leaving Skye on the Armadale Mallaig ferry.The SCT currently provides shop, post office and fuel services in two buildings no longer fit for purpose. Over £, has been raised from public and private sources to build a new shop with a community #social# space and offices for the employees of the Trust. They hope to open the new shop in early summer .In addition, the purchase by the Trust of the -hectare Tormore Forest in  continues to create additional sources of income, including selling housing plots as well as an attraction for the community and visitors alike. As trust business development manager Mike Shucksmith explains, the success is based on a combination of commercial and voluntary activity.He said: #To maintain the forest, we have to generate income so we sell split logs to the community, create woodchip for biomass boilers and are developing a micro-hydro scheme. At the same time, we have a vibrant volunteer culture in Sleat who have created a network of paths, social areas and a polytunnel where local school children can help grow saplings to regenerate the forest. The trust also operates #Skyenet # a community broadband network # a community transport scheme, Tormore Explore Forest School and the Visit Sleat tourism group, which promotes the area as a destination of choice for visitors.#From the Sleat Peninsula to the gateway to Skye in the south where a new access route to the island is being created by the members of the Broadford and Strath Community Company. They are developing a cycle path all the way from Kyle of Lochalsh to Broadford. One of the project pioneers is keen local cyclist, Andy Neison.#I used to commute from Teangue on Sleat to Kyle by bike,# he said. #I was really unnerved by the road from Breakish to Kyle with a high volume of fast-moving traffic. When friends told me about the old road from Broadford to Kyle I started exploring sections of it. It#s a good starting point and will become a pioneer project for the highlands.#After receiving a grant of £, from Sustrans, a sustainable transport charity, to fund engineering and traffic surveys, the Trust is now working to secure funding for a project officer to take the Skye Cycleway to the next phase. The community is heavily invested in the project with volunteers coming out in all weathers to clear sections of the old road, but this is a long-term project with hundreds of thousands of pounds ultimately needed to complete the full route from Kyle to Broadford.Over the Skye bridge, the Kyle and Lochalsh Community Trust is creating a vast community and visitor experience on a piece of land known as the Plock.Securing funding from the Scottish Land Fund enabled the Trust to take ownership of the Plock and the old Skye Bridge toll office and develop a masterplan for these two community assets. On the Plock itself, there will be a hub building with cafe, carpark and toilets, a network of accessible paths, a #pitch and putt# course, a Viking living village, accommodation pods, a watersports centre, wildle hide and a for thrill-seekers a huge zipline across the bay.Jo Wawrzyczek of the trust expects the Plock to attract , visitors a year. #This is an ambitious project that will cost almost £million,# she said. #However, it is very important for local people and businesses as it will help to create a great community space as well as keep visitors in our community for longer.#The trust also owns and manages the public toilets and pontoons in Kyle which will be a source of income for the project. With the aim of making the project self-sustaining, the Trust plans to lease the café and watersports centre on the Plock as well as generating income through the accommodation pods. Inspired by the success of other community-driven harbour developments such as Tobermory on Mull, Portree and Braes Community Trust want to maximise opportunities for local people and visitors through taking ownership of the harbour and improving facilities.The trust is currently in talks about relocating the oil tanks at the pier head which would be a breakthrough for the project and open up commercial opportunities. They are also considering a new road from the south to improve access and ert traffic away from the town centre. But according to development officer Fiona Thompson a new breakwater and pontoons will be the real game-changer for Portree.She said: #There have been aspirations for improvements to facilities at the harbour for over  years with little major investment.The harbour group are now closer than ever to realizing the community#s vision for a new, vibrant, welcoming port. A breakwater will allow us to provide overnight berths and efficient, comfortable transfer for cruise ship passengers, while a visitor centre will provide a warm highland welcome to visitors from across the globe. This project will be transformational for Portree and surrounding areas.#The community trusts of Skye and Lochalsh all have several features in common. They have vision, ambition, energy and drive and they are full of volunteers who are committed to bringing long-term projects to fruition for the benefit of their community # and their visitors # for decades to come."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Skye-Bridge-2018-winners.jpg","title":"skye bridge 10k race to kick start kyleakin gala","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe first bridge k was held  years ago, and since  hundreds have taken on the challenge in an event which has helped raise thousands of pounds for good causes based in Kyleakin and surrounding areas.back again.Online entry — which is discounted — will be open until Friday th August, or runners can register on the morning of the race for £.

was completed in  at Stramore Park and Phase  will connect these lands to Woodlands Park by the creation of an m riverside walking and cycling trail.The project has involved the creation of a short

The book states that “being the nineteenth century of the Redemption of mankind” the then Pope, Pius XI, had proclaimed  a “Holy Year”.“These facts have prompted the publishers to devise and reproduce this beautul and artistic Album containing the fourteen ‘Stations of the Cross’,” it states.“The primary purpose of the work of Irish Art is to provide a most appropriate and lasting souvenir for the Catholic home, in honour and commemoration of Holy Year.”It also reveals that the artworks are “exact replicas of the celebrated and valuable set in the Church of Mount Alphonsus, Limerick”, which belonged to the Redemptorist Fathers, who gave permission for their reproduction.According to the Redemptorists in Limerick, the Stations of the Cross in their church date back to  – just four years after the church was officially completed.Explaining his find, Fred said: “I bought it in a massive market in Kildare. I’m  now, so I would say it was about  years ago, maybe more.“I liked it because it was the Stations of the Cross and I thought it maybe would be worth a few bob in a lot of years’ time, but I never tried to sell it or do anything with it. It was exactly like that when I bought it so it was a good few years old then.“I just found it up in the attic of the house. I was clearing the attic out because we’re changing over from oil to gas and I came across it again.”He continued: “I just want to see what’s what with it.

Back in the day, the Lansdowne Court Hotel was the place to go in Belfast. In the past year or so, the place had become a bit tired and it was put up for sale. I see it as a great opportunity to restore it to its glory days and bring something to the people of the Antrim Road and North Belfast.”Jim and his co-owners have put a lot of money into the refurbishment and he is very pleased the way the stunning new premises have turned out.“It is the city centre on the Antrim Road,” he added. “Everything is top class from the drink, food, garden and bridal suite. We have invested heavily and also boast around  staff so it is great to bring jobs to the local community.“When we bought it last March, we thought it was going to be a quick refurb and it would be opened for Christmas but the further we looked at it, it wasn’t going to be a quick turnaround.“We wanted to do things right and we are very pleased with the way it has turned out.”Jim is hoping the eye-catching new surroundings and features of the Landsdowne will bring people through the door – and he hopes to bring his expertise to the project.“Our support from the local community to date has been second to none since we opened seven weeks ago.“Customers have been very welcoming to me and I want to welcome them too.“I am here every day as the face on the floor. My background is in s and food so I hope to bring a fair bit to the table knowledge-wise.“For anyone who hasn’t been yet, come and try us – you will not be disappointed!“We are open to suggestions for anything that can be improved.“The bridal suite is stunning. It is the only room that hasn’t been used yet but there are a number of weddings booked for later in the year.“The garden has been there over  years.“We have invested a bit of money in it for people to sit and relax, enjoy a bit of food and drink.“We also put a lot of thought into the food. It is served both in the restaurant and bar. The small plates are proving a huge hit with customers.“We think our food is top end and we are not charging top end prices.”“It is a pleasure to be here. I am really excited about the Lansdowne,” he added.The Lansdowne Hotel Antrim RoadBelfast BT EFTel:    www.thelansdownehotel"},{"url":null,"title":"apprentice boys we recognise the upset over para emblems","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The businesses in Portglenone are delighted as its brought a lot more people into the town.\"It doesnt take that long to sow the seeds,\" said Damian, who works at the local DLF Seeds company and knows what it takes to bring the field to le. \"It was just a couple of hours of walking up and down shaking the fiddle, but after that its out of your hands as to whether everything comes good.\"This year Damien and Karen, with their three children Cara , Ryanand Therese , have crafted another masterpiece.

Its dferent and we like to think its a very romantic setting,\" said Damien. \"We had three marriage proposals in the field last year, wedding parties coming for photographs, plenty of fashion photo shoots, buses stopping off on tours of the country and, of course, plenty of photographers. There were also a couple of music videos filmed.\"The families who have come along are getting back to nature. Its so good that people are getting out into the fresh air and appreciating natural beauty. Kids are running around the path spotting butterflies.\"Thats an added bonus this year, with a neighbour lending an extra acre-sized field where Damian has created the perfect haven for butterflies, and when work commitments allow, he is only too happy to take visitors on a guided walk through the wildflowers.\"Its worked so well,\" he said. \"Were getting plenty of guests! \"Weve seen some of the rarer types, like painted ladies and peacocks. Youd almost think they were looking at you as the patterns on the wings resemble eyes. Its lovely to see them coming into their natural habitat.\"Obviously were relying a lot on the weather, but its been warm enough so far this year to allow the sunflowers to come out. They are a tropical plant, so heavy rain can take its toll, but theyve survived so far andwe can manage to get a couple of decent sunny days, even more of them should come out. Were at around % right now, and they thrive on direct sunlight.\"Karen and her kids, plus an army of young people from the town, have all been roped in to keep the meadow in tip top shape, and she expects the field to be open to the public for the next few weeks.\"Obviously theres a limited time span for when the sunflowers are in bloom, soanyone does want to take a stroll through, forget all about everyday le and lose themselves in a natural world, the next two to three weeks will be the best time to experience it,\" she said.\"In the meantime, were only too happy to have people as our guests, bring a picnic or a flask of tea and enjoy it while it lasts.\"This year, Damien and Karen are raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

I also felt guilty that I didnt know what was going on, and there and then I decided Id better find out what it was all about.\"Taylor tonight broadcasts a previously unseen interview with a man who was said to have been the commander of the Derry brigade of the IRA on Bloody Sunday.The man, whose face is blurred, says the IRA played no part in the civil rights march and took all their weapons out of the area.Asked by Taylor what Bloody Sunday had done for IRA recruitment, the man replies: \"I would saywe had the facilities we could recruit the majority of the Bogside.\"Looking back from , Taylor says: \"If I had been a teenager that day on Bloody Sunday I probably would have joined the IRA. I would have considered taking that final step, which is what happened to hundreds of young Catholics, men and women.\"Taylor says that he thinks Bloody Sunday legitimised violence in the minds of many people who believed thatthe State could use violence against them, they would use violence against the State.Taylor says that as he looked at the bodies of the Bloody Sunday victims in a church, John Hume told him the person he should talk to was Martin McGuinness, whom he did interview and quickly assessed to be a \"natural leader who was very articulate, charismatic and friendly\".\"He looked you straight in the eye and he had eyes that could be friendly and warm and welcoming and he also had eyes that could be hard as iron,\" Taylor adds.He says that in his opinion McGuinness came to be the single most important IRA leader on the island of Ireland, a man who was \"charming and ruthless\", and who would go on to meet the Queen.Taylor continues: \"In the end he was somebody I came to admire, as did many of his fiercest critics because of the journey he made from war.\"After Bloody Sunday Taylor went on patrol with the Army in , the most violent year of the Troubles, and he is heard asking soldiersthey are biased against Catholics. One of them says it isnt possible to be neutral because of the dferent reactions the Army receive in loyalist and republican areas.One soldier says that most of his colleagues \"on seeing their mates shot would love to punch the f*** out of some Paddy\".Taylor says that many of the soldiers, not all of them, hated the Catholic community that they believed supported and harboured the IRA.Some of the footage in Taylors latest documentary is of the fledgling UDA after they set up no-go areas in response to similar moves by the IRA in the early Seventies.He says he understood why loyalists thought their heritage was under threat \"and they had good reason to fear that\".He also recalls how the \"bulwark of loyalism\", the Rev Ian Paisley, once told him to \"get you back\" to England, but how the \"funny, charming and irresistible\" politician later bought ice-creams for him and his crew.Taylor says his discovery in the s that terror suspects were being abused by the security forces at interrogation centres including Castlereagh shocked himHe adds: \"I really felt outraged by what I was convinced was happening. I got confirmation from all the main sources, apart from the police, who were denying it was happening.\"It was around that time in the Seventies that Taylor claims the Northern Ireland Office \"presumably encouraged by the Secretary of State Roy Mason\" said he was doing programmes that were unhelpful to the security forces who suggested that his bosses should get another reporter to cover the situation.Taylor says: \"I felt very exposed. It makes you think - have I got this right  And you conclude yes.\"He also deals with the IRA prisoners dirty protest and the resultant hunger strikes over political status in the Maze and how, against the advice of the NIO, Desmond Irvine, the secretary of the Prison Officers Association, gave him an interview in which he talked of the respect he had for the Provos for their protest.Two weeks later Mr Irvine was shot dead by the IRA and Taylor, who says he felt sick at being indirectly implicated in a murder, was asked by a journalist how he felt about having \"blood on his hands\".Taylor says he was in tears at Mr Irvines funeral and admits he considered stopping covering Northern Ireland, but decided to carry on with his work.He says Bobby Sands martyred himself for the cause and the hunger strike showed that the IRA had a reservoir of support, which built the  for the rise of Sinn Fein over the next decade.\"The Iron Lady met the Iron Men and the Iron Men won,\" he says, adding that in the Eighties after the hunger strikes neither the British Government nor the IRA were prepared to compromise, something the Provos illustrated with their attempt to assassinate Mrs Thatcher with the Brighton bomb.Back in Northern Ireland, Taylor says a killing which affected him deeply was that of teenager John Boyle, who was shot dead in  by the SAS the day after his Catholic father alerted the security forces that his son had stumbled on an arms cache in a graveyard in Dunloy.Taylor says Mr Con Boyle went to his grave without ever receiving an apology, adding: \"Its a small thing but its the least that should happen when these tragedies happen, its the least the family deserves.\"However, Taylor says that the SAS and their sister intelligence unit called The Det played a crucial role in what he dubbed the \"secret war against the Provos\" using a range of weapons including surveillance which could even tell the British what the terrorists were having for breakfast.In an interview for one of Taylors earlier documentaries, the late IRA leader Brendan Hughes tells the broadcaster the technology effectively brought the IRA to a standstill where they could move very, very little, and \"contained\" the organisation.Taylor says he was shocked when he found out that the security forces had been helping loyalists in what he called the \"dirty war\".He replays an interview with convicted UFF terrorist Bobby Philpott, in which he says he was getting so many intelligence documents for targeting republicans that he didnt know where to put them, and claims the information went right down to the colour of socks they were wearing.Taylor deals briefly with atrocities like the Enniskillen massacre, Michael Stones Milltown cemetery attack, Loughinisland, Warrington and the Corporals killings in Andersonstown and says he got a sense that all sides were growing weary of the violence.The documentary also focuses on Taylors coverage of moves by the British Government to persuade the IRA to call a halt to their violence.He revisits interviews with one-time MI officers Frank Steele and Michael Oatley and with an emotional Brendan Duddy, the Derry businessman who was used as a \"secret peacemaker\", liaising between the British and the IRA, who both realised they could not win the war.And Brendan Hughes is heard telling the broadcaster that the war is over.Taylor marvels at Ian Paisley taking office as Northern Irelands First Minister, and though he says the peace of today is not perfect, it is \"certainly better than what we all went through for all those awful, bloody, desperate years\".Taylor says no one apart from dissidents wants to go back to those years of violence.But he says another major outstanding issue remains - how to deal with the past, in particular the prosecution of soldiers, like Soldier F, for killings including Bloody Sunday.Taylor says he thinks the law must take its course.Towards the end of the documentary he addresses the question of the border and predicts: \"In the long tunnel of history a united Ireland is perhaps more likely than not.\"But he adds: \"That will only happenunionists are party to it.\""},{"url":null,"title":"with each passing day every shred of hope faded now noras family is left utterly broken","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Nor did they find any footprints inside the villa or forensic evidence to suggest an unknown person was inside.More than  officers had joined the search for Nora by August  and her grandfather Sylvain Quoirin, mayor of Venizy in north-central France, said it was \"unthinkable\" that she had wandered off alone. As the search intensied, more details emerged about the family.It was reported that the Quoirins are an Irish-French family who have lived in London for  years.Mea­bh is chief executive of a consumer analytics company there.Four days after the teen went missing, officials hunting for her in the dense jungle played a heartbreaking recording of Noras mum calling \"Nora, Nora darling, mummys here\" through loudspeakers in an attempt to reach her.Mrs Quoirin reached out in a statement describing her as \"a special person\" who is \"fun, funny and extremely loving\" as the frantic search for Nora continued, adding: \"She is not like other teenagers. She is not independent and does not go anywhere alone.\"Both parents also thanked the search teams helping to look for their eldest daughter, saying \"it means the world to us. We are so grateful for everything that you are doing for us\".On August , Malaysian police set up a hotline dedicated to receiving information about Nora and two days ago a £, reward, donated by an anonymous Belfast business, was announced for information leading to Noras safe .Appearing before cameras on Monday, a tearful Ms Quoirin said: \"Nora is our first child. She has been vulnerable since the day she was born.\"She is so precious to us and our hearts are breaking.\"Yesterday saw a devastating conclusion to the familys horric ordeal as their hopes of finding Nora alive ended at a waterfall the young girl was said to have been excited about seeing when she arrived in the resort.But, for the Quoirins, there will be no end to the devastation or the grief that was visited upon their lives during a brief stay at a remote eco-resort that robbed them of their bright future with their precious daughter."},{"url":null,"title":"house prices increase by 2 in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

You have a duty to be impartial and objective as journalists, so do that because the reporting of Brexit has been so biased for so long now.”Pressed on who he thought was controlling the media, Mr Braine said: “I think they are being controlled by an EU federalist class – I mean I would go so far as to say a traitor class – people who are conspiring with foreign powers against the people of this country.“If you look at, for instance, BBC Question Time lists over the last three years… statistically it’s way off the scale in terms of bias.

That total and then some was passed in no time and has now risen above the pound, mark which has delighted Jeff.ldquoMany thanks to all the sponsors, supporters, players, umpires and scorers, Jeff enthused.ldquoThanks also to Liz Byrne, Jackie Wilson and Dave Crudgington who ran the refreshments and food made by chef Ryan Finnegan. We just couldnrsquot have achieved our target without the help of a lot of people and I can never thank them enough, he added.Sunday was an emotional day for Jeff and he was at times reduced to the odd wee tear.ldquoRodney Hassardrsquos tribute had me close to breaking down, but I was able to hold it together. I got my wish of playing alongside a lot of my former team-mates and I am indebted to them all for turning up and sharing the occasion with me.In the first challenge game of the day Dundrumrsquos current first team took on a squad of former Dundrum players that included Alan Mills and Darren Oldroyd, from Drumaness, Mark Yeates, from Downpatrick, and Byron Woodruff, from Saintfield.The game was competitive to say the least and thanks to decent knocks from Terry Hutley , Stuart Campbelland Sean CameronDundrum posted .Yeates sent the stumps cartwheeling on two occasions with Oldroyd also picking up two wickets. Harry Hitchins got the prize wicket of first team captain Ian Wright.The golden oldies rolled back the years in reply with Rodney Hassardshowing his undoubted class in his first game in five years.Woodruff made , including two big sixes off Cameron and Shilliday danced his way down the wicket, as used to be the norm, for a quick fire . Oldroydand Yeatescompleted the job with five wickets to spare.The second game saw some excellent ball striking and decent bowling from an NCU Select team.Saintfieldrsquos Byron Woodruff and the best young prospect in County Down,  year-old Adam Reid, treated all the bowlers with contempt as the runs flowed quicker than the refreshments.Man of the match Reid hit  not out in only  balls including eight boundaries and one massive six that went out of the ground.Superb all rounder Woodruff showed his old team-mates what a talent he is, hitting  in  balls with four big sixes and the same in boundaries.If both had not retired they would have scored centuries and the Dundrum bowlers were happy to clap them off. Ricky Owens then rolled back the years with a splendid , including three big sixes and three fours, the NCU side posting .It was perhaps fitting that Alan Mills, the oldest player on the pitch and still ultra competitive, finished  not out.Dundrum fought back well after the early onslaught with good fielding catching and astute field placing by captain Gavin McNerlin.Wickets were shared around with Chandar Shekhar the pick of the bowlers, taking  for  of three overs. Shilliday was again on the money and finished with  for . McNerlin, Keba Butler, Neil Reilly and Peter Calvert all got one wicket apiece.Dundrum got a steady start from Greg Hutleyand Rodney Hassard before Drumanessrsquo Neil Gelston removed them both. Oldroyd then hit the middle stump with successive deliveries leaving Dundrum on  for .McNerlin hit Gelston straight over the scoreboard in his  before Stuart Campbellwas run out by Woodruff. Saintfieldrsquos T McCavera picked up two wickets with CIYMSrsquo Steven Hughes and Woodruff also getting in on the act.The last wicket partnership of  between Neil Reillyand Keba Butlergot Dundrum closer than it looked as the NCU side ran out comfortable winners.The match ball sponsors were Bao and Bento and Pizza Palazzo, Newcastle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Downpatrick railway’s first afternoon tea event is runaway success  ","story":"THE Downpatrick and Co Down Railway got out the best china when it hosted its very first afternoon tea event recently.The experience started with guests boarding the train at Downpatrick town station and taking a relaxing journey, travelling in a comfortable s carriage, to Inch Abbey by steam train.They then boarded the buffet carriage where guests were welcomed by the volunteers with a glass of prosecco, wine or a soft drink, before being directed to their allocated tables to enjoy a mouthwatering selection of freshly handmade sandwiches, luxury homemade scones with jam and cream and mini French patisseries.Guests were also offered bottomless teas and coffees, or their own pot of luxury specialist tea.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner, who was one of the servers, said: ldquoThis is something wersquove wanted to do for some time, and itrsquos always been a very popular treat on heritage railways in Great Britain.ldquoNerves may have been a bit jangled as with all first events. How would it go down with our visitors  Wersquod never done anything like this before.As it turned out, stomach butterflies were swtly replaced with full bellies.ldquoIt sold out very quickly and in the end there were lots of smiling faces and empty plates, Mr Gardiner said. ldquoThe only downside was that the volunteers didnrsquot have any leftovers to enjoy.Mr Gardiner reveals the preparation that went into the event.ldquoWe knew the food would be great. It was freshly prepared by Franck Breacuteteacutecheacute from Mange Tout, who we have worked with before on private charters mdash including my own th birthday party mdash and we were determined that this would look the part.ldquoWe scoured charity shops across the county to give forgotten but beautul old bone china tea sets a new lease of le, including fabricating  new cake stands from scratch using these lovely vintage finds ndash no modern off the shelf crockery for us.ldquoIt also marked an attempt to ersy our offering and attract more people to the railway and the local area than might otherwise come.Paula OrsquoNeill, along with her friends Natasha Mellon and Denise McGuinness, travelled from Ardee in Co Louth and gave the day the thumbs up.ldquoThe gluten free option was excellent mdash great iety and lovely presentation with plenty of options of drinks available.

The group was also taken on a walking tour of Montalto Estate in Ballynahinch.The Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group also organised a charity garden party to enable the visitors to meet their friends from the Rowallane and Slieve Croob areas in an informal setting, which included the councilrsquos deputy chairman, Terry Andrews, and concluded with a rousing performance of La Marseillaise.Cllr Casey welcomed the French delegation with a reception at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel, Ballynahinch.He said: ldquoThe main objectives of the three-year plan of the twinning arrangement are to organise healthy activities and events, bring generations together in experiencing two fabulous cultures and share our heritage with partners from all over the south of Ireland, west of Scotland, Galacia in Spain, Wales, the Isle of Man and Brittany.ldquoAs part of our councilrsquos strategic objectives, we are striving to become a premier tourism destination on the island of Ireland, and empowering and improving the capacity of our communities.He told the visitors: ldquoThese objectives could not have been achieved without the continued support we have received from initiatives such as twinning arrangements.ldquoFrom visiting the area and investing in our local businesses, to bringing dferent cultural experiences to the citizens of our district through ious projects, I would like to thank you.He added: ldquoOur mission as a council is to lead and serve a district that is prosperous, healthy and sustainable.ldquoI am pleased to have you all here to celebrate the  years of this twinning arrangement.

If something does not happen soon we are finished, he said.ldquoTo be owed something like pound, by a public body like the Housing Executive is scandalous and someone should step in to sort this mess out.The crisis has been sparked off by staff shortages and industrial action in the accounts department of the Executive.A spokesman for the Executive said they were extremely concerned at the situation and had brought it to the attention of the Government.ldquoThere have been a number of vacancies in the department and we are unable to fill them because of the Government ban on recruitment to the public service. The result is that we cannot porocess these settlements as quickly as we normally do.He added: We are trying to do all we can to help the smaller contractors who are always much more vulnerable in such a situation.NEWCASTLE mdash A verdict of accidental death has been ed on Newcastle motorcycle ace Tom Herron, who died at the North West  earlier this year.Thirty year-old Herron, ranked third in the world, came off his bike at mph and smashed into a lamp post just  yards from the finishing line in the cc race. He died in hospital two hours later.The inquest at Coleraine heard how Herron had ridden in the race with an injury to his thumb and arm, but the pathologistrsquos report could not determine whether this would have interfered with his ability to control the bike at high speed.Two police constables, who witnessed the accident, told the inquest that the bike scraped the ground and the rider then lost control.The coroner, Mr Robin Wray, discounted suggestions to close the Portrush circuit and said that the racing gave a great deal of pleasure to a lot of people. He added that he had seen Herron race many times and always had a great admiration for him.DRUMANESS mdash Fresh hope for the old Drumaness Mill, which was becoming something of a white elephant, emerged this week with the news that Irish Waste Services have long term plans to develop it into an industrial estate.This week a spokesman for the company confirmed they had already moved on to the site. The long term plans for the , sq ft red brick building involve the setting up of an industrial estate with potential for several hundred jobs. The firm will advertise shortly for tenants and the spokesman explained that there was a real need for small factory premises providing employment in the area.The story of the mill since it closed down when owned by Hurstrsquos as part of the Ulster Weaving Group, when at one stage it provided work for  people, has been a long saga of disappointment.The mill was sold to Irish Waste for around pound, recently. This figure falls far short of the original asking price at a public auction held in Ballynahinch last year, which was believed to be around pound,.The news of employment hopes for Drumaness was welcomed by the chairman of Down Council, Mr Eddie McVeigh, who said it was ldquogood news indeed.He added: ldquoI would welcome anything which would bring jobs to the Drumaness area and I hope that this is not one of the many disappointments which we have suffered over the last few years.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Plessey Telecommunications in Ballynahinch was closed on Monday when more than  production workers walked out as part of a national campaign to obtain shorter hours and more pay.The strike action will be repeated on the Monday of the next two weeks and the production workers are also refusing to work overtime.Their demands are for a basic skilled rate of pound, a reduction in hours to an eventual  hours a week and two extra daysrsquo holiday.A spokesman for the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions said: ldquoWe would have prefer to have obtained our realistic claim by mutual agreement with the employers, but unfortunately we are left with no other alternative.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash A strong plea is being made to boat owners on Strangford Lough to combat the nuisance caused by inexperienced owners of large fast powerboats.It comes from Mr T W McKee, of Sketrick Island, a noted yachtsman with more than  yearsrsquo sailing experience behind him.He is annoyed by a recent ldquomafia-type display of outrageous aggressiveness by a powerboat owner and would like to find an authority with the power to control such ldquoblatant abuse of delightful waters, not to mention the risk to innocent people and their boats by sea-borne thugs.In a letter to the Recorder, Mr McKee describes how his -foot yacht was rocked from side to wide so viciously by the wash of the powerboat, which buzzed around it, that his family and grandchildren were lucky not to be seriously injured as they were flung back and forth across the wheelhouse.He has passed the complaint to the Coastguard in the hope that they can have action taken, but understanding that use of Strangford Lough as a navigable waterway is free to all who wish to use it, he does not expect any success.PORTAFERRY mdash A public meeting is to be held in Portaferry next week to protest about plans for sewage disposal in the town.The meeting has been called by the local development association, which is concerned that the scheme about to be launched will be inadequate.Councillor Paddy Doherty, a member of the development association, appealed for the support of townspeople to support the meeting so that plans can be drawn up to combat the scheme by Ards Borough Council.Mr Doherty said the council originally proposed a filter bed scheme, which would pump treated sewage into Strangford Lough, but then abandoned the filter bed idea.LOUGHINISLAND mdash It was a historic day for the community in Loughinisland when Paddy McFlynn, the president of the GAA, declared open their new Macartan Park on Sunday.The weather certainly could have been kinder for the biggest day in the history of the club, but nevertheless there was a good crowd to witness the opening, as well as the football and hurling games.Mr Vincent Doran, the chairman of the club, welcomed the distinguished guests and said Loughinisland was one of the oldest clubs in East Down. They had a proud tradition and the opening of the new park was the fulfilment of a dream.The new park was blessed by Fr Charles Bready, PP, Loughinisland, Among those also presentwere Gerard McShane, East Down chairman T P Murphy, county secretary Harry McEvoy, Ulster Council delegate and Matt Fitzpatrick, county registrar.LISTOODER mdash Mr Thomas Steenson, who is leaving shortly to live in America, was the recipient of a specially inscribed Bible from Mr James Brownlee, Worshipful Master of Listooder Orange Lodge, at a dance in Listooder on Friday night..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Gaelic championship fever erupts  ","story":"CHAMPIONSHIP fever will be sweeping through the county over the next five days.Reputations will be put on the line as all the sparring that has taken place throughout the league campaigns is replaced by an iron resolve to make a mark.The action gets underway tomorrow night with four games down for decision.Most interest will be focused on Pairc Esler with Clonduff taking on Saval in the SFC at pm. A few weeks ago Clonduff would have been regarded as red hot favourites to progress against their Division  opponents.However, it is uncertainthe Hilltown outfit will be at full strength as several of their players headed off to the USA a fortnight ago.Clonduff were beaten - to - on Friday night by Burren and given half a chance, Pat Havern and Daniel McCarthy could take full advantage of Clonduffrsquos misfortunes and lead Saval to a surprise win.The curtain-raiser for this game is the IFC encounter between Drumaness and Glasdrumman at .pm. Drumaness are expected to progress as the Quarter Road outfit have yet to win a game this season and seem certain to be relegated from Division .A Gary Murdock-inspired Drumaness beat Glasdrumman - to - at the start of July and they will be intent on repeating that result.There are two IFC games also down for decision over at Fontenoy Park when Drumgath face Darragh Cross and Teconnaught clash with St Johnrsquos.Darragh have been involved in a tense battle for promotion into the top flight, but recent defeats to Carryduff and Longstone have dented their aspirations.However, they are a championship team and in Shane Murray, Michael Monan, Joe McKinney, Matty Hardy and Anton McGrattan they have players capable of going all the way this year and Drumgath, who lie in second place in Division , will do well to get a result.The Teconnaught v St Johnrsquos derby should be a nice opener for the Drumnaquoile side who are more than holding their own in Division  with John Clarke, Conor Morgan, Marty Keenan and the Flanagans all in good form.Teconnaught, who won the JFC title last season, will rely on Paddy Grant, Jack Larkin, Ciaran Carville, David Kelly and Tony Davis to keep them competitive.Friday night sees another four games take place mdash two in Burren and two in Newcastle.A lot of focus will naturally fall on the SFC game between Kilcoo and An Riocht in Burren.Kilcoo have made no secret of the fact that they are determined to regain the Frank OrsquoHare Cup after losing out to Burren in last yearrsquos decider.They have blooded several new faces this season and are well in the running for the ACFL Division  crown, but they will not be taking An Riocht lightly, despite theirindferent season in Division . The Branagan, Devlin, Laverty and Johnston brothers will ensure Kilcoo go into the game in the right frame of mind.At the same venue, Shamrocks clash with Tullylish with the outcome hard to predict.Tullylish have fallen from grace in recent months and have been cast adrt at the bottom of Division . Shamrocks are in the top half of Division , but it looks asthey have missed out on promotion yet again.The game of the night should be in Newcastle where Carryduff lock horns with Castlewellan in the SFC.D J Morganrsquos Carryduff side seem destined for Division , while Castlewellan are battling to avoid relegation to Division .Carryduff have really made their mark this season with James and Daniel Guinness, Owen McCabe, Ronan Beatty, John McGeogh and Josh Connery all to the fore.Castlewellan are just now starting to get a few of their walking wounded back in action and Sean Dornan, Liam, Donal and Gareth McKibbin, Colly Flanagan, Rory Burns and Daniel Morgan could prove a handful for a young Carryduff side.The curtain-raiser to this game is the IFC encounter between Annaclone and Atticall.Ciaran Branniganrsquos Annaclone have been blazing a trail of glory at the top of Division  and it is unlikely that Atticall, who are  points behind them in the table, will inflict their first defeat of the season on them.Annaclone were held to a - to - draw by a fast-improving Ballymartin side on Friday night, but they still should have too much firepower for Atticall.Saturday sees another four games take place.Top billing goes to the Loughinisland v Longstone SFC clash in Castlewellan.Loughinisland have taken Division  by storm since theirthis season and are riding high in third place after Friday nightrsquos - to - win over a good Warrenpoint offering at Macartan Park.Longstone, on the other hand, are embroiled with Carryduff for an automatic promotion place at the top of Division  and now that Ambrose Rogers and Mark Poland are back to full fitness, this should be a cracking affair.Absolutely nothing separated the sides when they met in Division  last year and the same should be the case on Saturday.Loughinisland will rely on their big hitters Dan Gordon mdash still good enough to be playing county football mdash Jonny Flynn, Rory Mason, Stefan Mason and the McClements brothers and they should progress.This game will be proceeded by the Saul v Bosco IFC encounter.Saul,they can reproduce the sort of form they showed a fortnight ago to beat Carryduff, will be expected to ease past their Division  opponents, but championship football doesnrsquot always work that way.Bosco fell to a narrow - to - defeat away to Clann na Banna on Friday night while Saul were soundly beaten - to - by Bredagh.However, Donnan Ritchie will have his charges pumped up for this encounter with the Arnold, Harney and Mahoney brothers prepared to take the game to Bosco.It will be a short trip down the road to Kilcoo for the next two games on Saturday.Glenn play Liatroim in the IFC at .pm and Bryansford take on Bredagh.Neither Glenn or Bredagh have been causing a stir this season, but now is the time to turn it on. Liatroim should be at full strength with the McCrickard connections finally finished with their county hurling commitments and the Fontenoys might just cause an upset.The big game on Saturday night is the Bryansford v Bredagh game in the SFC.Bryansford have been plagued by injuries to key players all season long, but in Davy McKibben, Ruairi Wells, Danny Savage and Conor Maginn they have the men for all jobs and I would expect them to see off Bredagh.Brendan Masonrsquos outfit hammered Saul on Friday night and in Donal Hughes, Tommy McElroy, Eoin Costello and Conor Francis they have players capable of mixing it with the best, but last yearrsquos IFC winners might find Bryansfordrsquos physicality too much to handle.There are another three games to be played on Sunday.Ballymartin face Clann na Banna in the IFC at Mayobridge at pm before Warrenpoint take on Ballyholland and Burren lock horns with neighbours Mayobridge at Pairc Esler.Ballymartin seem to have turned the corner after a few disappointing results, but they are now operating at full strength again and warmed up for the championship with a draw against runaway Division  leaders Annaclone on Friday night.Clann na Banna are sitting in a comfortable mid-table position, but I donrsquot think they will give Ballymartin too much to worry about.The Ballyholland v Warrenpoint game should be another close encounter.Ballyholland may lie bottom of the Division  table, but Warrenpoint are only four points above them. The lsquoPoint have potential match winners in the Boyles and Ross McGarry with Ballyholland looking to the Murphy brothers, Tiarnan Rushe and Seamus Loughran.The Mayobridge v Burrren game is the tie of the round.Paddy OrsquoRourkersquos side, the defending league champions and Frank OrsquoHare Cup holders, will not relinquish their grip on both trophies without a fight.They have been a little bit inconsistent of late, but bounced back to their best on Friday night with a comfortable - to - victory away to Clonduff, while Mayobridge were beaten - to - by Kilcoo.In Kevin McKernan, Donal OrsquoHare, Liam Kerr and the McAvoy brothers, Burren have the perfect blend of youth and experience, while Maybridge will look to Corey Quinn, Shane Annett and the combative Conor Garvey to keep them interested.Downpatrick and Rostrevor bring the curtain down on the first round of fixtures when they clash in Hilltown on Monday night.The sides met last Friday night in the league at Petit Park with Rostrevor winning - to -. However, Caolan Mooney, who was literally unplayable in that game, is unable to play in the championship and that could well hand the initiative to the Hoops.Downpatrick will again look to big performances from their big game players and they donrsquot come any bigger than Gerard Colllins, Michael Magee, Conor McGrady, Jarlath Branagan and the Turley brothers.Without Mooney, Pete McGrathrsquos side will look to Conor Doyle, John Connolly, Shan Parr and Piras Kane for inspiration..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Great turnout for multi cultural event in Ballynahinch  ","story":"HUNDREDS of people attended the multi-cultural family friendly celebration at The Square in Ballynahinch on Saturday.The Connecting Cultures Event was held to help promote community cohesion and encourage acceptance and understanding of other cultures.In addition to music from all over the world, there were dancers entertaining the crowd, face painting, an exotic petting farm, stilt walkers, circus skills and cuisine from ious parts of the world.The African drumming proved particularly popular, with people of all ages keen to take part.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We learn about the Romans, World War Two, the American Civil War at school, but most people have never been taught about the history of their own country.ldquoWe have more castles than any other country in the world per square mile, and thatrsquos something worth celebrating.Fonmon Castle is a rarity among Welsh castles, uniquely well-suited to creating interactive events like jousting, workshops, Renaissance and Steampunk fairs, and many more.ldquoFonmon Castle is one of the few Welsh castles that is still lived in, explained Mr OrsquoHenessey. ldquoIt has remained within two families since it was built by the Marcher Lords during the Norman invasion.ldquoIt recently it was sold to a very friendly couple and they headhunted me in order to help them turn the castle around, to open it up to the public and help teach people more about Welsh history.ldquoTheyrsquove basically provided me a blank cheque. I want people to wake up in the mornings, and wonder lsquowhat shall we do today at Fonmon Castle rsquoThe first of these events, on Wednesday, August , will feature medieval re-enactments, living history displays, medieval combat lessons, have-a-go archery, childrenrsquos play areas and dino walks - and will be free.ldquoWe have so much history to offer as a country, said Mr OrsquoHenessey. ldquoI want to really start to show it off.To find out more, email info@fonmoncastle article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says. Once again, it raises serious concerns over the agri-sector in particular, meat in particular, and beef especially, in regards to “increased vulnerability to low cost non-EU imports in the GB or NI market”. Its not just the physical goods, though as it says Northern Irelands IT sector is facing the cost of exporting services increasing, by an average of .%. And regarding foreign direct investment– one of the big business buzzwords here over the last few years – it says “under a ‘no deal’ exit, NI’s FDI attractiveness would be negatively impacted”. “A ‘no deal’ would see losses in the medium to long run of % per annum in the case of the number of FDI projects and of .% for FDI-related new jobs.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/hamilton_hotel.jpg","title":"new  bedroom hotel for titanic quarter","story":"Posted on Monday  July  by John Mulgrew Belfast looks set to get a new -bedroom hotel amid freshly submitted plans for a development across from Titanic Belfast.

A statement, signed by  business organisations and trade bodies, says that “two and a half years on from the collapse of the Executive, and now approaching the likely conclusion of the Brexit process, the Northern Ireland business community is deeply concerned at the continued absence of a ing administration and is calling on political representatives to redouble their efforts to reach agreement to get the Assembly and Executive working again”. “There has seldom been a time when strong and effective leadership has been more necessary, both to deliver on the domestic agenda and also to speak up for Northern Ireland in the Brexit process. “We need a fully ing administration to agree and deliver a Programme for Government that will build infrastructure, reform our health service and education system, ensure we have a strong economy, and create opportunities for our young people. We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise.

Editor John Mulgrew looks at the numbers, the analysis and the once household names no longer with us The tattered corner of the Ulster Business Top  list from  probably isn’t the worst way to analogise the then state of the Northern Ireland economy, and a precursor to what was around the cornerWe’ve come a very long way in a decade, and while there are some big and familiar names on the  Top  list, there are firms which have fallen off it entirely, and resigned to the history books post-recession.In former editor David Elliott’s intro to the magazine, it references the fact that most of the accounting periods in the list were just as the downturn was starting to gather pace.Economist John Simpson, writing in the edition, says the “big recession of  and  did not impact evenly across the economy, and recovery will be best seen as a sequence of dferent proportions”.There are some positive things to take from it – including a large glowing image of Victoria Square, which in the more than  years since it opened in the heart of Belfast has become part of the retail fabric of the city.Topping the list at the time was Viridian Group, which owned Northern Ireland Electricity and now includes Power NI as a subsidiary, with turnover of £.bn. However, it made a loss of £m during that period.Second on the list is a business familiar to many. Quinn Group, headed by Co Fermanagh businessman Sean Quinn, posted turnover of £.bn for the year ending    but incurred a loss of more than £m during the same period. There have been enough column inches written about the business in the years since then to fill many a book – and they have.Among those no longer on the list is developer David Patton  SonsLtd, Armaghdown Creameries Ltd and Ballyrogan Holdings.Many others on the list have since been acquired by some of the now giants in their respective industries.Moy Park is an interesting one. Back then it was still a large player in the poultry sector with turnover of £m.Those fortunes have evidently changed dramatically since then, as the company has held the top spot on the list for the last eight years, and now posts big profits and turnover of £.bn.Meanwhile, WR Barnett is on the  list in position , with a turnover of £m and pre-tax profits of £m. In the last  years, it has climbed the list to comfortably take the number two spot with sales of almost  times that of those a decade earlier.As far as employment goes, it was Tesco topping the list in , followed by Bombardier – which at the time had a workforce of around , people – with Royal Mail and Queen’s University following in third and fourth position.A lot has happened in the years since that list. The economy has slowly but surely gotten back on its feet. Growth has been gradual, and in the last year or so has been sitting at around %, while employment levels and unemployment levels are at their respective positive record levels. However, we are amid the most challenging time for business in a generation and some of the signs, and whispered conversations, are far from positive. As I write this, we still sit on the precipice of whether we secure an agreement on Brexit, or shuffle off the edge without a parachute. Let’s hope it’s the former.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/flav_1.jpg","title":"top  moy park takes number one spot","story":"Posted on Thursday August  by Ulster Business From a purely editorial perspective it would be refreshing to have a dferent company head up the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies list.But Moy Park has now made it to the top for eight consecutive years, as the poultry processing giant continues to expand both its workforce, global sales and pre-tax profit – firmly setting its place at Northern Ireland’s biggest business, with a workforce of more than , here alone.In the last year, it has grown turnover to just over £.bn, up from £.bn a year earlier, while pre-tax profits have surged by % – rising to £.m in its latest set of accounts, ending December .The business supplies Moy Park branded and own label chicken products to leading retailers and foodservice providers throughout the UK, Ireland and Europe.In numbers, Moy Park processes six million fresh chickens each week, , turkeys a year, along with , tonnes of other ‘added value products’.London-born Chris Kirke replaced long-serving boss Janet McCollum in , less than a year after Craigavon-based Moy Park was taken over by new US owners Pilgrim’s.And around a year ago, Flavio Malnarcicjoined the business – then as executive business director – before taking over as the firm’s chief financial officer.He was formerly business director at JBS Global, and has a senior leadership background as executive director of the poultry and export business in Seara, also as chief financial officer and chief executive at Tyson do Brazil and finance roles in Cargill.“There has been a consistence in the performance. We have been growing volumes… we got to six million birds each week, which is about a third of the UK market. For the UK, it is a signicantly big company.“Looking year-over-year, our performance was very consistent in the last few years.”“For people working there, working for a company which is the largest employer in a country, the top company, it is a source of pride for us.“But I don’t think that drives the behaviour of the team. We are more interested in making sure that our performance is sustainable in terms of margins.“It is nice that we arebut that is not our main goal. We are making sure that we are sustainable, work on quality, safety. There are lots of other things. It’s making sure that we fit our customer needs.“We have a lot focus on that, and we need to be competitive.”And as for growth, expanding turnover isn’t necessarily the main focus, according to Flavio“A lot of the efforts in the last year have been to consolidate the management tools they have in Pilgrim’s. They are very keen on efficiency, so that’s one of their strategies. “ a lot of focus in improving our performance, it’s how we can be more efficient, focusing on a portfolio that feeds our customer base, how we deal with our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
