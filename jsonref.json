This is a dog\u0027s way of trying to actually talk to us.\u0027They know we will understand what they are trying to tell us because as our relationships with dogs have evolved, we have learnt to read their signals as well as they read ours.\u0027And because dogs are really smart, over the years, they\u0027ve extended how they talk to us using their gaze with the evolution of the \u0027puppy dog eyes\u0027 look, which is designed to pull on our heartstring by mimicking the wide-eyed look of babies.\u0027As this research reveals, most dogs are using the power of the gaze as more of a stare to get us to understand what they want from us and owners understand what their dogs are telling them.\u0027Whether it\u0027s going outside, getting a treat, or encouraging us to change our focus onto them and give them some fuss, we clearly understand what our dogs want.\u0027Communication comes down to either staring or barking or whining for dogs.\u0027Where staring fails, barking will always work - although it\u0027s a bit less subtle.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Too chip shop saveloys 22 000 time wasting calls Met year","story":"Share this article \u0027If you are in a situation where you need to speak to the police, please think.

After finding the bore hole, Mr Stevens decided to reopen the 30ft deep well and tapped into the natural spring          The eco-businessman was inspired to turn the natural spring into a business after watching David Attenborough\u0027s Blue Planet and now provides customers with their own Yawl Spring mineral waterThe eco-businessman had the idea of using the dispensers after watching Blue Planet and seeing the amount of plastic bottles that end up in the world\u0027s oceans.His tanks come with an electric rechargeable pump to allow the user to pour the mineral water out through a tap into a cup or bottle.The environmentalist is now hoping to sell his water dispensers for £5 each to owners of holiday lets in the area, businesses and private homeowners.He said: \u0027To me it\u0027s a no brainer because you don\u0027t even need to buy a water cooler because of the pump on top.\u0027It also means people have to use less plastic bottles which is better for the environment.\u0027Lyme Regis is quite anti-plastic at the moment so hopefully this can tap into the local interest.\u0027Installing one of our water dispensers makes drinking spring water cheaper than buying bottled water.\u0027It also helps holiday makers reduce their plastic footprint by reducing their need for plastic bottles. They can just refill a bottle from the dispenser before going out.         The businessman hopes his project will tap into the local interest and see fewer people use plastic bottles.

Obviously it was not: Alasdair Gray’s novel had been in the world for 23 years by then. (It arrived, like me, in 1981.) But Lanark is so entirely surprising that any first encounter with it is an encounter with the new. It is the kind of book that could look like proof of madness if it had never been published, a 600-page epic with elaborate illustrations (by Gray) and idiosyncratic typesetting, interlacing realist sections set in Glasgow with satirical fantasy set in a parallel city called Unthank, written in four books and starting with book three.I fell in love. It was an unlikely passion. Gray displayed his politics with disarming plainness – he believed in Scottish independence and socialism I was a milksop unionist and social democrat. Moreover, I was a feminist, and Gray was a sometime pornographer whose female characters barely scrape two dimensions. Lanark is not particularly dirty, but Gray’s superb second novel, 1982, Janine, is unambiguous filth, chronically the compulsive, unruly fantasies of a middle-aged man called Jock. Something Leather is straight-up lechery. But Gray’s writing is not the tyrannical kind that can only be enjoyed if you agree with him. He makes easy company with disagreement.In Lanark, the eponymous hero becomes a delegate to a council of nations where he is shocked by the cynicism of statecraft. Lanark speaks up floridly for idealism: “We have no nature,” he says. “Our natures are not built instinctively by our bodies, like beehives they are works of art … It is bad habits, not bad nature, which makes us repeat the dull old shapes of poverty and war.” “Your flood of language is delicious,” says the senior politician he is trying to influence, “and can have no possible effect upon human nature.” This exchange is the essence of Gray’s politics. We could be better, and we will continue to be bad so long as we cannot honestly reckon with our own badness.It’s this clarity about human (specifically male) failings that makes his writing about sex compelling, rather than repulsive. His sparkling Victorian pastiche Poor Things offers two accounts of the origins of a woman called Bella McCandless. Should we believe Bella’s husband’s sensational telling, in which she is the product of a male scientist’s experiment to produce the perfect child-woman (the brain of an unborn infant implanted in the body of its dead mother)? Or should we believe Bella’s counter-narrative, in which she furiously asserts that she is a real person after all?Embedded in the fantastical version is a frightening kind of truth about how men see women. The broadly tedious genre of men interrogating masculinity has a long way to go before it catches up with Gray’s sharp eye on power and desire, his keen sense of the taboo on men confessing vulnerability. Perhaps this is why I have pressed Gray’s novels on my friends with such disturbing intensity: here, read this and then you will know how I see the world.There is an instant understanding between those who love him.

We could stock the pantry with bags of it and rest easy. Why can’t we? Because the notion of sustainable eating is irreducibly complex. It is inextricable from culture and geographically variable.The idea of “sustainablility” reflects our values, and our values are as variable as our tastes. They might include animal rights, genetic modification, use of natural resources and a living wage for farm workers, just for a start.There may be no such thing as food that is socially just, environmentally beneficial and cheap. But everyone prefers to spend less. So how do we economise without compromise? Maybe the simplest answer is to eat whole unprocessed food, and don’t waste it. To do that, you need to build skills in the kitchen. If you eat meat, choose the very best-raised animals you can afford (pastured, not grain-fed, and directly from a small producer if possible), treat meat as the precious resource it is and use every bit of it down to the bones.Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall’s The River Cottage Meat Book came out 15 years ago and has aged as well as a prime cut of beef. It puts appropriate emphasis on the quality of the meat you buy, makes offcuts approachable, their preparation straightforward and the results delicious. No diet is sustainable if you don’t enjoy it.Tamar Adler’s An Everlasting Meal is full of beautiful sentences that yield sensible ideas to make cooking whole food, including meat and fish, in your own kitchen a practical pleasure. Her take on leftovers is the best way I have found to reduce food waste.And Wendell Berry is the master of showing the world what sustainable farming looks and feels like, of revealing its central importance to our souls as well as our stomachs. His collection Bringing It to the Table gets directly to the connection between eating and morality.• Kristin Kimball is the author of Good Husbandry: Growing a Family on a Community Farm, published by Granta."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d51df25d7e45a7fc5ea0bb358f53e2c702ecd86/0_83_3613_2168/master/3613.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d89a876d7fcbc572f85e85ac52c2498","title":"how financial markets turned upside down in 2019","story":"Weak data used to send stocks down but the promise of never-ending cheap money from central banks means the only way is upWith one day of trading to go, 2019 is on course to be one of the strongest in the history of financial markets after shares around the world racked up record after record in another barnstorming year.But none of these countries, with the exception of the US, are in particularly good shape. Instead their stock markets are being sustained by ultra-low borrowing costs led by the US Federal Reserve.This latest round of rate cutting has turned many of the assumptions about economics on their head to create a bad-news-is-good-news paradigm for markets.While once the release of poor economic data dented share prices, now it sends them upwards because investors expect more central bank intervention.Traders have learned the lessons of the past 10 years and have grown accustomed to expect central banks to act at the slightest sign of economic distress. Markets had a serious wobble in 2018 after the Fed hiked rates. But a U-turn amid intense pressure from Donald Trump, who blamed the Fed chief, Jerome Powell, for stifling growth, has brought the good times back again.Governments have increasingly abdicated old-fashioned pump-priming economic management, leaving it to central banks whose only tools are to cut rates or introduce money creation schemes such as quantitative easing. This hasn’t done much to revive most major western economies but it has succeeded in flooding the financial markets with cash, boosting prices of assets such as shares, bonds and property.The prospect of a truce in the US-China trade war and the probable resolution of Britain’s Brexit imbroglio have helped boost optimism in recent weeks, says Eleanor Creagh, economist at Saxo Capital Markets in Sydney, but the really important factor was central bank policy.“The really key driver is coming from central banks and central bank liquidity,” she said. “A whole host of central banks are in easing mood. There is a very high bar for central banks to turn back to rate hikes and normalisation of monetary policy.”This meant investors were free to buy up assets despite high valuations, safe in the knowledge that monetary policy was effectively underwriting their trades.“For investors, the key consideration is that the central banks have your back and you’re free to buy and it doesn’t matter what the economy is doing.”US Federal Reserve policy – first designed as an emergency response to global financial crisis but now the norm – is so dominant that the pattern can be seen not just in the UK, European and Japanese markets, but right around the world.The Reserve Bank of Australia has reduced interest rates to record lows in the hope of improving sluggish growth. Likewise in South Korea and Thailand where the authorities have signalled that more monetary easing is on its way, confident that the Fed will keep the music playing.Creagh says the Fed’s recent decision to pump $500bn into the repo market – short-term borrowing for dealers in government securities – added more fuel to the market fire and wa sa kind of backdoor stimulus. By January the Fed’s balance sheet (mostly bonds that it has to pay out on eventually) will surpass what it was at the height of the massive quantitative easing programme instigated after the global financial crisis in 2008, leading some to dub the current expansive policy as “stealth QE”.The repo liquidity boost is set to end in the new year at which point markets will look for another sugar hit or, alternatively, more of a convergence between equity prices and the real economy, Creagh says. For this to happen they’ll expect to see green shoots and something more real in the economy.Although doomsayers see this market reversal as an ominous portent, most observers agree that there are no immediate signs of the worldwide recession that many have predicted.But they also agree that central bank policy has become increasingly ineffective and is close to running out of steam as we head into 2020.Damien Klassen, of Nucleus Wealth in Melbourne, argues that when QE first started after the financial crisis, stock markets were slow to feel the positive impact. But with each wave the impact has been more predictable and is now already reflected in prices before it has been fully rolled out.“We need governments to take over and start spending although it’s certainly not happening in Australia with our surplus-obsessed government.“Trump is doing his part – he’s happy to spend other people’s money as fast as he can and the UK election was about who was going to spend more. Europe is in a holding position but at some stage politicians have to start spending.”What happens if governments don’t take up the baton is not clear.“The question is, do they need a crisis to start spending and will the markets provide that crisis?” says Klassen. “It could come from corporate debt this time. Otherwise the markets will grind sideways next year because I cannot see where earnings growth is coming from.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddaf258509b355b27ede07d0100b36f6b1d9517f/0_7_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac0aea384aee954a06aa4e3040b3fd49","title":"guardian cities 2019 a look back at the 10 most read stories of the year","story":"From segregated playgrounds to homeless deaths to all things concrete, it has been a busy year at  CitiesIt has been our best year yet at  Cities. We broke open a major ongoing scandal about London’s segregated playgrounds, told the story of why concrete is the most dangerous material on Earth, and profiled some of the roughly 800 people who died homeless in the UK. Each of those projects was tipped for major journalism prizes.Globally we spent a week reporting live from Tokyo, and then from the cities of South Africa explored underground cities examined how cities are increasingly being built from scratch and profiled the next 15 cities set to reach “megacity” status of 10 million people.We also found the best and most exciting examples of when European cities “get it right” looked at the great canal revolution, for which we published our first print supplement in collaboration with the Observer and kicked off the award-winning the illustrated city, a series of graphic comics by illustrators around the world giving their takes on urban issues in a less linear way than newspapers generally do.In the US we examined how cities are sweltering in unprecedented heatwaves, the various ways the Bay Area’s cities are being radically transformed, and took a deep e into the rust belt city of Cleveland, where we identified the “city champions” helping to improve their communities despite the decades of inaction of sclerotic local government.Last but not least, our ided cities documentary series has been telling original, reported stories about how cities are increasingly split by huge global schisms – from wealth to food and walls to heat. The series premiered in Rotterdam in October to great acclaim for producer Anetta Jones, director Max Duncan and  executive producer for documentaries Jess Gormley.All those aside, 10 inidual stories attracted the most visits by readers – and here, in ascending order, they are:Incredibly, 25 years after the fall of apartheid, there is a town in South Africa that refuses to accept black people to live and work. Orania, a small Northern Cape settlement, is littered with old apartheid flags and monuments to the architects of segregation. A key piece in our South African Cities Week, edited by Nick Van Mead, the story sparked outrage.Hasankeyf, on the banks of the Tigris River in south-east Turkey, is thought to be one of the oldest continuously inhabited settlements on Earth. But this jewel of human history will soon be submerged, as part of a controversial dam project, despite residents’ protests.Oliver Milman reported how cities across the US were struggling to adapt after China banned the import of recyclables, leading some municipalities to burn vast volumes in of plastics, paper and glass in incinerators – and terrifying the locals who feared for their health as a result of the air pollution.In March,  Cities’ shocking revelations that a multimillion-pound housing development in London was blocking children of less well-off tenants from using some communal play areas sparked outrage. James Brokenshire, then Conservative housing secretary, called the situation in south London “outrageous”, while there was also criticism from the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan.In something resembling good news, Kingston, New York is trying to build an inclusive and self-sufficient local ecosystem. Its anti-capitalist, anti-establishment healthcare model sees artists trade work for healthcare (“some artists say the care they received even saved them”) and it has its own regional micro-currency.San Franciscans have long complained that tech workers ruined their city, driving up rents and homelessness and eliminating ersity. Now even the tech workers agree. A terrific piece of reporting from the ’s excellent San Francisco based reporter Julia Carrie Wong.The original scoop – in which  Cities revealed that a developer, Henley Homes, had blocked social housing residents from using shared play spaces at its Baylis Old School complex in south London – led many readers to contact us about other examples of segregation in housing developments. The campaign eventually led the government to announce it would ban segregated play spaces in all new housing developments across England. Reporter Harriet Grant and editor Chris Michael were nominated at the British Journalism Awards for Campaign of the Year.The face of New York is changing at a rate not seen for decades. Oliver Wainwright, nominated for Arts Journalist of the Year at the British Journalism Awards, reported on a new species of super-tall tower springing up in the city, a result of engineering prowess, zoning loopholes – and an unparalleled concentration of personal wealth.Many countries put homeless people in temporary accommodation as they try to get their life back on track, with an apartment as the ultimate reward. Finland, however, views secure housing as the starting point and decided to make housing unconditional. Now rough sleeping has been all but eradicated in Helsinki. This story by Jon Henley in part helped inspire Danny Lavelle and Simon Hattenstone to embark on their series The Empty Doorway, a series of heartbreaking and must-read profiles of people who’d died homeless. The series won for best Feature at the British Journalism Awards.The top-read Cities story of 2019 won the Foreign Press Association award for Environment and Science Story of the Year, part of our special series,  Concrete Week. In this gripping critique, Jonathan Watts detailed the devastating and wide-reaching impact on the natural world of our addiction to concrete – the most widely used substance on Earth after water. “By one calculation, we may have already passed the point where concrete outweighs the combined carbon mass of every tree, bush and shrub on the planet. Our built environment is, in these terms, outgrowing the natural one.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09e8df83c112f430fa0125bede9f08a272b375fe/158_329_3342_2006/master/3342.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c0738d01658df8ee7fd75ca630cfd02","title":"brexit tory mess labour future new vision","story":"Whoever ends up leading it, the Labour party is likely to vote against Boris Johnson’s Brexit bills in parliament. After Brexit ceases to be a rhetorical dreamcatcher – a magical totem, after which all will be well – it will turn into a series of practical decisions with real-life consequences, many of which will be adverse.The current parliamentary Labour party is unlikely to repeat the mistakes of 2015, when austerity bills were waved through after Ed Miliband’s defeat because voters were said to want it. Head-to-head opposition will be of only symbolic use, given the Conservative majority, but there may be smart manoeuvres that come off, with a deft enough operation. There will also, inevitably, be a need for protest, case by case – likely, in the short term, for the rights of EU citizens, against race-to-the-bottom trade deals, and against incursions into existing workers’ rights.But the party must stop allowing its own ideas and debates to be shaped by the contours of Brexit. In its election of a leader, in its constituency meetings and all the activism it takes to rebuild, the party needs to move on. Brexit is a Conservative disaster that the Conservatives must own. By 2024 Brexit will be in the past, and the government will be trying to blame its inevitable woes on some enemy other than Europe. Those of us who have spent three years fighting for Labour to help reverse Brexit have no further work here. Those who have trumpeted the referendum result as a great democratic roar will now have plenty of other democratic deficits to focus on.Labour is constitutionally predisposed to internecine recrimination, and to try and stamp that out would be ahistorical. But those battles should be centred on real issues, not symbolic differences. Brexit did open up genuine isions on the left, but the questions raised by the vote to leave the EU did not map very closely on to the party’s own fissures. The rhetorical weight of Brexit created new binaries that were completely false: suddenly, if you were in favour of free movement or migrant rights, you were also opposed to the dignity and self-determination of “workers in the north”. (This is a conflict that the union movement resolved some decades ago, by situating exploitation where it belonged, with the people who set wages and conditions, not the people who battled to live on them.)Seen through the prism of Brexit, you couldn’t be in favour of EU cooperation on the environment without being against democracy. Overnight, you had to choose between elitist internationalism and authentic nationalism. The left allowed itself to be shunted into these isions: the multicultural versus the white the young versus the old the metropolitan versus the left-behind. That only made sense in the context of remain and leave. Never in its history has the Labour party attempted victory by tilting one way or the other between such gigantic, amorphous demographics.But these debates should not simply be closed down – instead, they can be had on their own terms, separated from Johnson’s Brexit. There will be decisions to make about migration after we are outside the EU and its structures. If we disagree with the points-based system – which most outside the Conservative party do, since it is implicitly racist in intent – then what are the ideal criteria?If we agree with free movement – which, again, most in the Labour party do, judging by the motion passed at this year’s conference committing Labour to “maintain and extend free movement rights” – does that entail a policy of open borders with the EU? And if not, what is it? If we disagree with the kneejerk ambition for “fewer” migrants, what narrative do we put in its place?As a starting point, I would suggest that union activism across borders is the most creative way to prevent such exploitations as do arise from free movement. I would suggest, furthermore, that racism is the live issue that all those people who want an “honest conversation about immigration” mysteriously don’t want to talk about. And to have any hope of resolving this, we have to stop responding to an increasingly far-right characterisation of the issue and start building our own principles, effectively from scratch.Similarly, the climate crisis has ended up in a zero-sum game with the decades-old legacy of deindustrialisation. It makes perfect sense from a Conservative perspective: environmentalism is what students care about, manufacturing and its stagnation are what preoccupy the towns and their authentic working-class residents. Never mind that this makes no sense from a policy perspective. Urgent action on decarbonisation was the only decent idea – indeed, the only idea – that anybody has ever had to reseed high-skilled employment in areas outside the south-east. Everything else was just buses, free ports and whining about London.The prime minister has already banned the word “Brexit” from his own communications, as if an omertà will make its consequences invisible. It won’t. There is a real danger that everyone but the Tories will keep it at the centre of their arguments, and it will become, by sleight of hand, everybody’s fault but the people who did it. But that is not the biggest problem for Labour.The party cannot resolve its hopes into a clear and programmatic set of ideas through the fog of someone else’s fantasy. It cannot make sense of its own values in the middle of someone else’s culture war. Too often, Labour has resolved such crises by simply jettisoning its values in favour of electoral calculation, whose abject failure was guaranteed by that very act. It must not make the same mistake again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31072796efc9bea701f3fb0a53226720dc1abb02/0_0_3517_2110/master/3517.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb9fc5bb1674de09c447d2b859b4d7c2","title":"the guardian view on the gig economy stop making burnout a lifestyle","story":"A decade ago a ride-hailing service called UberCab launched in Silicon Valley. Since then the rebranded Uber has burned through $10bn. It has never made a profit. The business model relies on shareholders to subsidise cheap rides so that the company can squeeze out rivals and establish a monopoly. Uber’s success is that 90 million people now use it in 700 cities around the world. After it floated on the stock market, its two founders became billionaires. While the owners of Uber have become immensely wealthy, the people who drive its cars have paid a heavy price. Unions say that Uber drivers in the UK earn an average of £5 an hour, well below the legal minimum wage of £8.21 for employees aged over 25. They can work up to 30 hours a week before breaking even. Hundreds went on strike in May to protest against poor pay and conditions.The other half of gig work is remote – providing digital services, such as data entry and programming, on platforms such as Upwork, Freelancer and Fiverr, which act as auction houses for human labour, where people place a bid to do the work on offer. Those in richer nations can find themselves undercut by those in poorer places. In 2017 US freelancers using Upwork netted $27m – only a little more than those in India. Many of the world’s biggest firms use these apps to outsource work to lower costs. Microwork, where tasks are broken down, is dominated by Amazon’s Mechanical Turk ision. Two-thirds of its US workers earn less than the federal minimum wage.Consumer rights are being rewritten – often to the customer’s detriment. People using popular takeaway apps such as Uber Eats and Deliveroo can order from thousands of restaurants without being aware of their poor hygiene ratings. Such practices undermine the trust needed for the market economy to function smoothly. Hidden beneath the claims of autonomy is the fact that the platforms exercise firm control over most aspects of how, and to what standard, work is done. The technology can monitor whether a freelancer is working for the whole time billed. It can detect whether a gig-economy driver brakes too hard. Too many low rankings might see a worker kicked off a platform. Productivity becomes the way to measure human value. Firms can cherrypick workers – usually those without children or in good health. What happens to those who have lives that don’t match the gig economy’s demands?In the gig economy, employees are no longer protected by a legal system that was designed for a different age. At present there are three categories of employment status in the UK: employee, worker and self-employed. Only the first category is entitled to full employment rights, including redundancy payments, parental leave, and protection against unfair dismissal. The second category ought to have their minimum wage and trade union rights protected, as well as paid holiday entitlement. However, gig-economy firms assume their workers to be self-employed, and fight trade unions such as the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) who claim otherwise. In almost every case workers in the gig economy have proved that they are in fact employees. It is absurd that judges must protect workers from forced self-employment. Britain does have labour laws, but they are not fully applied. This allows gig firms to fight claims inidually and then just pay off the worker who wins in court without applying the ruling to the wider workforce. The Conservative government offers only cosmetic changes to the rules governing the gig economy. It would be better to regulate platforms properly. For example, the IWGB suggests that Uber’s licence to operate in London could be made conditional on respecting drivers’ employment rights.It ought to be possible for workers to have flexible work without denying them basic rights. Businesses can only compete fairly if employment rules are equally applied and consistently enforced. On a deeper level, the gig economy is erasing what was for many the traditional goal of working: to buy free time. Instead we are being seduced and coerced into thinking that it is good to commercialise our leisure time and possessions. Time to spare? Exchange it for cash by delivering pizza. Your apartment free for a week? Rent it out for extra cash. This will not make us happy. We ought to work and have careers that enable us to focus on our relationships and have soul-enriching pastimes. It cannot be socially good to consider leisure time as a lost commercial opportunity. Unless we can turn away from such thinking, we shall see ourselves acting less like humans and more like companies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcef299895af2bf43d3bdade9b616a1581d0ec99/371_0_3454_2073/master/3454.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9fbd6922f1030feccc7d70bd2b4664c","title":"among 412 new species finds this year natural history museum the greta thunberg beetle","story":"Discoveries by Natural History Museum in 2019 include lichen, snakes and extinct dinosaursMore than 400 new species previously unknown to science have been discovered in the past year by experts at the Natural History Museum.Species described and named for the first time in 2019 include 171 beetles found around the world, one of which was named in honour of the teenage environmental activist Greta Thunberg.Lichen, marsupials, snakes and even long-extinct dinosaurs are among the 412 new finds officially named in the past year by the museum‘s scientists, who represent one of the world’s biggest groups working on natural ersity.But the experts warn that species are being lost faster than they are being discovered and many may vanish before they even become known.Tim Littlewood, the museum‘s executive director of science, said: “Species discovery is always exciting and shows just how much there is still to understand about our planet.“Learning how evolution has yielded new species able to live in Earth’s erse habitats is awe-inspiring. Sadly, much of that adaptation and biological ersity is now severely threatened and we are losing species faster than we can discover them. We are losing our understanding of the natural world, breaking our own connection with it and the connections that underpin nature’s stability.”The largest group of newly described species are Coleoptera, or beetles, found in places including Japan, Malaysia, Kenya and Venezuela, with scientific associate Dr Michael Darby naming the Nelloptodes gretae after Thunberg.Max Barclay, the senior curator in charge of Coleoptera at the Natural History Museum, said: “The name of this beetle is particularly poignant since it is likely that undiscovered species are being lost all the time, before scientists have even named them, because of bioersity loss.“So it is appropriate to name one of the newest discoveries after someone who has worked so hard to champion the natural world and protect vulnerable species.”This year has seen the naming of eight lizards, five snakes, four fish and an amphibian native to India, including Trimeresurus arunachalensis, the first new species of pit viper from the country in the last 70 years, as well as wasps, centipedes, aphids, snails, moths and butterflies.Discoveries of extinct species including the pig-footed bandicoot Chaeropus yirratji, an unusual marsupial that had vanished by the 1950s. Two new species of dinosaur were discovered, including a stegosaur Adratiklit boulahfa, found in Morocco.The 2019 discoveries also included seven new plants and seven lichens, as well as 12 species of deep sea polychaete worms from the sediments of the dark depths of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone in the Pacific Ocean."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cec8ac68b0fc1a0f7c0cb1396150990157724bb/311_566_3289_1974/master/3289.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffd6be023a8792c0b0bd34886ca10976","title":"what is turnardern and why is everyone in new zealand talking about it","story":"Jacinda Ardern’s media popularity has irked some, and spawned this hashtag. One  staffer asked another to explain it ... quicklyWhat is this “Turn Ardern” movement all about then?It was kickstarted by a 66-year-old Christchurch bricklayer and involves people turning over books and magazines featuring New Zealand’s prime minister on the cover so her face can’t be seen.The movement’s leader, Colin Wilson, says the protest was peaceful and now has hundreds of followers who have filmed themselves “turning” Jacinda Ardern in grocery stores and bookshops, and posting their efforts on social media.“People are sick and tired of all the fluff articles – people want a prime minister and not a fashion model,” Wilson told the New Zealand Herald. “A lot of us feel she spends a lot of time doing photo shoots instead of running the country.”Wilson says the end-goal is to drag down magazine sales featuring Ardern, meaning she has more time for work such as fixing child poverty and the housing crisis.Interesting logic. Is she really on a lot of magazine covers? And is that her fault?Ardern has generated huge international interest and attention, and since her election in October 2017 she has been on the cover of British and American Vogue, the Australian Women’s Weekly, and dozens of other domestic and international magazines, not to mention multiple TV appearances.A biography of the PM has also just been published, The Story Behind an Extraordinary Leader (unauthorised, the PM did not sit for an interview with the author), with a second biography due out early next year.Ardern has become the most internationally recognised and well-known New Zealand prime minister ever. Her global fame is a new experience for Kiwis, not used to the international spotlight, and has made her an easy target for the opposition and detractors, who frequently accuse her of focusing more on international affairs than domestic ones.Those poor shop workers who have to return the magazines to their rightful state – what do they say?There are reports that the #TurnArdern campaign is causing extra work for book shop workers and low-wage employees in supermarkets and newsagents, and on social media some users have reported encounters with #TurnArdern protesters.There has been a nasty backlash against #TurnArdern, too. Since the campaign leader’s identity emerged, he has received threats – including against his life – and been trolled and vilified online.Is this a sexist thing or does Wilson have a point?The author of the new Ardern biography, Michelle Duff, wrote in the Spinoff that the campaign is unequivocally sexist and another attempt to “silence women”.“#TurnArdern is just another manifestation of this simmering hatred of women that lies just beneath the surface,” Duff wrote. “The fact that a group of men are so threatened by the image of a powerful woman that they can’t even bear to look at her face is not really all that funny.”“Throughout history, attempts have been made to silence women. We’ve been drowned as witches, denied the vote, gaslighted in relationships, had our ideas stolen in meetings, had our voices and views disbelieved and minimised. We’ve been done to, not done by.”Is there a “turn Ardern back again” movement?There is, and the publicity has also boosted the sales of the new Ardern biography, which has spent seven weeks on New Zealand’s bestseller list. Under the hashtag #ReturnArdern, people have filmed themselves turning Ardern books and magazines the right way round again. Former PM Helen Clark tweeted that the #TurnArdern movement had been counterproductive and “spawned” the #ReturnArdern hashtag, which hints at a possible re-election slogan for the Labour party in eight months’ time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/749606117f427ed866bc206c93c721e86c825704/0_171_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3315d3b4a5fc49b54fb6b60338fb4788","title":"do you have a favourite tree share your pictures and stories","story":"As part of a new series, we’d like you to tell us about your favourite tree and why it’s special to youAs deforestation continues to threaten green space around the world, and the ’s Christmas appeal launches to tackle it, we’d like to celebrate our trees.Outside of their ecological value, many of us have sentimental attachment to trees.

She was now “very happy”, he said.“She stopped talking ... she stopped going to school,” he said of her illness, adding that it was the the “ultimate nightmare for a parent” when Greta began refusing to eat.Svante Thunberg, an actor, said he and his wife, the opera singer Malena Ernman, scaled back their professional lives to spend more time with Greta in order to help her overcome her depression. He became vegan and his wife stopped travelling to concerts by plane.He said Greta became energised about green issues as the family began talking more about environmental issues. He accompanied her on her tour of the United States and visit to the Madrid climate crisis this year“I did all these things, I knew they were the right thing to do ... but I didn’t do it to save the climate, I did it to save my child,” Svante Thunberg said. “I have two daughters and to be honest they are all that matters to me. I just want them to be happy.“You think she’s not ordinary now because she’s special, and she’s very famous, and all these things. But to me she’s now an ordinary child – she can do all the things like other people can,” he said.“She dances around, she laughs a lot, we have a lot of fun – and she’s in a very good place.”He was concerned about the negative comments his daughter attracted in the media and online and “all the hate that that generates”. But his daughter dealt with it “incredibly well”.“Quite frankly, I don’t know how she does it, but she laughs most of the time. She finds it hilarious.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f55e4d16e1dc0577561c591fbc76b472ec7fcfb/0_12_2949_1769/master/2949.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b67331165c379d04601724cbade6642","title":"daniel lee at bottega veneta 2019s star of british fashion","story":"The 33-year-old from Bradford picked up four gongs at the UK industry’s annual awardsTom Cruise, Kylie Minogue and Rihanna joined industry titans from Giorgio Armani to Naomi Campbell at The Fashion Awards 2019 earlier this month, but the undisputed star of the night was Daniel Lee, a 33-year-old fashion designer from Bradford whose name is barely known outside of the industry.As creative director of Bottega Veneta, Lee swept the board with a record-breaking four accolades. Nominated in four categories, Lee won all of them – including the night’s top award of Designer of the Year, in which he triumphed over Miuccia Prada, Kim Jones of Dior Menswear and Gucci’s Alessandro Michele.The four gongs at the Royal Albert Hall added up to an official coronation for Lee, catapulted overnight from being the style insider’s favourite name to drop to being a power player.Bottega Veneta, a venerable Italian leather goods label whose signature basketweave leather bags have been a no-logo status symbol for more than half a century, is enjoying a bounce with the arrival of Lee, who was appointed in June 2018.On Instagram, the ultimate barometer of fashion’s feverish and ever-changing passions, Bottega is everywhere. Tina Leung, an influencer with 288,000 followers, recently posted a photo of herself in a yolk-yellow skirt in Bottega’s distinctive quilted leather style. The fan site @newbottega, which posts images of Lee’s designs and imagery, has gained 152,000 followers.The roots of Lee’s cult status lie in his backstory. Before arriving at Bottega Veneta he was right hand man to Phoebe Philo, as director of womenswear at Celine during six years of the decade when the label was a byword for grown-up modern elegance.When Lee jumped ship to Bottega Veneta shortly after Celine had been given an unrecognisable new look by Philo’s successor, Hedi Slimane, many in fashion hoped that the old Celine look – clothes for the woman who wants to stand out at the art fair – would reappear, with a Bottega Veneta label.Lee’s killer instinct for spotting the look the fashion industry would want next was evident in his first solo showcase, a Bottega Veneta advertising campaign launched in January 2019. Shot by Tyrone Lebon on the Italian island of Ischia, the images featured models in bermuda style shorts, black evening tailoring, and oversized gold curb chains – all styles which went on to become fashion catnip in 2019. His debut show, held in Milan a month later, was the hot ticket of the season. Lee told editors that he wanted to honour the “quiet craft” of the Italian house, but to bring an “injection of modernity…turning up the volume”.When the show began, those who hoped for a wholesale cut-and-paste of his work at Celine were disappointed. The collection was more radical than expected, and garnered mixed reviews. Lee – who has said of fashion’s unknowable algorithms that “what will work is the thing that isn’t already there” sent out black leather and low-cut necklines in a show that fused the aesthetic of The Matrix with the label’s stealth-wealth heritage. Bottega Veneta was glossy where his Celine had been matt, eroticised where Celine had remained opaque, hedonistic where Celine had been serene. Heavy workwear boots and chain-embellished coats added a punk flavour to the first collection.While some Philo-philes were left cold, a new audience were intrigued. Low, square necklines were an instant standout, with Lee telling reporters backstage after the show that he had taken the shape from Renaissance portraiture. The square neckline has grown in popularity on catwalks and high street in the year since, and is a signature look for spring 2020 at the cult Danish label Ganni.Lee has described the Bottega Veneta he inherited from the previous designer, Tomas Maier as a “sleeping giant”. Founded in Venice in 1966, its haughty stealth-wealth status attracted a wealthy backer in the Gucci Group – now Kering – who bought the label in 2001. With the arrival of Lee, who has since been joined by new CEO Bartolomeo Rongone, previously at Saint Laurent, Kering are looking to jumpstart the brand.“I wasn’t so scared about losing our ready-to-wear, shoes and jewellery customers as it was such a small part of the business by comparison, and that gives you a certain confidence to tear things up,” he said.

They were reportedly intended to highlight works from both high profile and lesser known creators.Suggesting a perception that film is generally a more powerful medium than television, Obama also listed three television shows “that I considered as powerful as movies”: the true-story based MeToo drama Unbelievable, the recent adaptation of Watchmen, and the second season of Fleabag.Obama also promised in an earlier tweet that a list of his favourite music would be forthcoming."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c144a071736ba18018d870dcdd8ddbb67ee08f0d/0_0_3444_2067/master/3444.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3a45df0d3f5cd6ee4e43b42ac290ff4","title":"best movies 2019 film guardian writers","story":"From a devilish documentary to a Hitchockian thriller,  writers pick their favourite films of the year that didn’t get enough attentionThis quite extraordinary film from the 28-year-old Russian director Kantemir Balagov was a prize-winner in Cannes in the UK it had three showings at the London film festival and then went straight to the streaming platform Mubi. Everyone should see it. The inspiration is The Unwomanly Face Of War, the 1985 oral history of Soviet women’s wartime experiences by Nobel laureate Svetlana Alexievich. In the shabby, traumatised city of Leningrad after the war in 1945, two women have survived: a tall, unworldly young woman nicknamed “Beanpole” and her friend Masha. The two women have a bond of friendship relating to the little boy, Pashka, that Beanpole looks after, and this becomes the keystone of a terrible, shared tragedy. A harrowing, vital movie. PBA rare modern film based on an epic poem, Swedish directors Pella Kågerman and Hugo Lilja’s first feature film Aniara begins as a sci-fi adventure and ends up an exploration of chaos, despair and cultural collapse. A transport ship moving wealthy evacuees of an increasingly uninhabitable Earth gets thrown off course on the way to a Martian colony. The cruise liner, replete with arcades and a psychotropic sense-memory evocation room, is self-sustaining, so survives as a generation ship. Help is always just around the corner, as are the numerous conspiracy theories damaging morale. As time grows infinite, new social structures emerge, some of which are technologically advanced, others more primitive. I’ll just come out and say the wordsinterplanetary sex cults. The film doubles down on weirdness, leaving no narrative corridor unexplored. High Life and Ad Astra both found their audiences this year, but this movie, far superior, unfortunately slipped into a black hole. JHA man goes to a nightclub, spots a fetching stranger sporting a leather getup, and scurries off with him for a casual shag in a side room – where the masked figure then murders the guy by spiked dildo. So begins an erotic slasher with a clear sense of humor about itself, counterbalanced with serious considerations for the Aids epidemic and the ostracizing of the gay, porn and gay-porn communities. A serial killer stalks the French blue-movie industry in 1979, targeting the stable of performers employed by producer Anne (Vanessa Paradis), who has some unresolved issues of her own with her ex-girlfriend and current editor Loïs (Kate Moran). As they jointly work through production on the film they title Homocidal and the body count continues to rise, director Yann Gonzalez stages ravishingly, ripely carnal set pieces at the intersection of fear and desire, a nexus at which the film’s milieu of decadent queer indulgence has been comfortably situated. CBWhile the premise of Penny Lane’s brilliant documentary Hail Satan? initially appears to be pure sensationalism – the use of black masses to counter white supremacy – as the film unfolds, the story becomes both stranger and more uplifting. Lane introduces the devilishly good work of the Satanic Temple, a growing group of activists who are challenging the encroaching overlap between church and state through the use of satanic imagery. So, if a government building in Arkansas erects a Christian monument on its grounds, the Temple campaigns for its own religious symbol to be built nearby: a 10ft statue of Baphomet. The theory is closer to satire than satanism, but there’s a deeply felt sincerity to the Temple’s work also. That goes further than its defence of democracy – its there in its embrace of ersity and a pretty impeccable set of moral values. Not all heroes wear capes some of them wear horns as well. PHWe’re living through a climate emergency it’s fitting then, that Canadian film-maker Brett Story has made a film about the apocalypse. Borrowing its format from Chris Marker’s Le Joli Mai, which examined Paris in 1962, shortly after the Algerian war, The Hottest August is set in New York circa 2017, during its hottest summer on record, eloquently drawing poetic links between the island’s rising temperature and the political tensions bubbling between its residents. Her vital critique of the way late capitalism is mutating both the planet and the values of the people inhabiting it invokes Karl Marx, Annie Dillard and Zadie Smith but the experience of watching is more visceral than cerebral, conjuring a genuine (and genuinely terrifying) sense of creeping, paralysing dread. An alien soundscape designed by Ernst Karel of the Harvard Sensory Ethnography Lab helps to create further a feeling of futurelessness. SHThe Last Black Man in San Francisco is the charming, elegiac tale of Jimmie Fails, a man trying to hold on to a San Francisco that no longer exists. Living across the water in Oakland, Jimmie dreams of a lost era when his family lived in a beautiful Victorian house in San Francisco, long before the tech industry changed the city into something colder, more manufactured, and less like home. Jimmie travels across the east bay every day and stealthily maintains the exterior of the house, mourning the fact the affluent white couple who moved in are allowing it to fall in disarray.Joe Talbot’s first feature film is many things. It’s an eccentric buddy comedy, on par in color and tonality with Wes Anderson’s works. It’s a near-documentary, in its look at gang culture, gentrification, and the damaging effects of toxic masculinity. But ultimately, it’s a portrait of a break-up, showing how one’s heart can be tethered to a place that ultimately does not love you back. It’s a film that deserved more attention than it got, and should definitely be required viewing for anyone who’s moved to San Francisco in pursuit of the American dream. GSThere’s a scene in Midnight Traveler, a documentary by Emelie Mahdavian, that has stuck with me probably more than any other this year: Hassan Fazili, forced out by the Taliban and deep into his family’s journey from Afghanistan to Europe – one he, his wife Fatima, and two daughters consistently film on their mobile phones – recounts a story of personal terror in voiceover. The screen is full of landscapes and undramatic footage Hassan doesn’t need to show you the story to get its impact. In fact, filming his family’s pain, what once felt like an act of artistic resilience, now feels ethically queasy. His meditation on the ethics of filming, of prioritizing the screen instead of the people in front of you, is one of the many surprising, deeply empathetic layers to this low-fi documentary that subverts any tropes in coverage of the “migrants’ story.”The film, stitched together by Mahdavian using the family’s cellphone footage and collected via a messenger over the Fazili’s two-plus year journey, communicates a much-covered crisis in bracing honesty by putting the story of a family’s formative years first. Its cadre of small, relatable moments – singing in the kitchen, playing in the snow, a playful marriage quarrel – make Midnight Traveler quietly revelatory. The Fazilis are buffeted by their circumstances but not defined by them at every turn, it prizes experience and honesty over seeking sympathy. Few films have given me the illusion of understanding another’s journey this year more than Midnight Traveler few films show more power in the quiet moments. AHGraham Norton aside, Ian McKellen and Helen Mirren didn’t do a lot of press for The Good Liar. It hasn’t made a lot of money and it isn’t figuring in the awards conversation. All of these are a pity, because it’s not just very well made, it’s also supremely entertaining – one of few films I’ve seen in recent years where I really wanted to know what happens next.The pair meet on a genteel dating site. She’s a wealthy widow he’s a conman who’s scented his next big score, and is faking it as a moderately hobbling old buffer. So far, so enjoyable. But the plot loops are more elaborate than that premise suggests the stakes higher, the history rather more freighted. Around the halfway point you don’t start wondering who is really scamming who you start doubting almost everything you’ve seen before.This isn’t a knowing homage like Knives Out nor a glossily postmodern box of secrets, like Pain and Glory. It’s just a straight-down-the-line thriller, built on a nest of twists, perched on shifting sands. It won’t especially make you cry or laugh, or think differently about the world. But it completely commands your attention. For two hours, everything else is irrelevant. And sometimes that’s enough. CSChinese auteur Jia Zhangke has for some time now been making brilliantly acute fables of modern China: a huge country undergoing a dislocating upheaval while still not fully recovered from the last one. His films tend to be oblique in intent, partly to enhance the ambiguous nature of their conclusions, but also useful in that – in contrast to contemporaries such as Lou Ye – Jia is not seen as a threat by censors.Well, Ash Is the Purest White is a remarkable film: elliptical and not exactly user-friendly, but building with a granite-like power that profiles the chaotic birth of the communist-capitalist era at the turn of the millennium. Jia, appropriately, turns to the gangster-movie format to tell his story, at least at first. A local hoodlum, or jianghu, named Bin, gets the sniff of power in the grimy industrial town of Datong after his boss is murdered his girlfriend Qiao is fiercely loyal but ready to disengage with the gang life. When Bin overreaches himself in a street fight with opposing goons, Qiao fires off a pistol and takes the rap – and the prison sentence – for Bin.Ash Is the Purest White then heads into less conventional territory. After she gets out, Qiao realises Bin has moved away from Datong and abandoned her, and she tries to confront him. But the relationship, it seems, is beyond repair her fortitude and fidelity of no account. Scrapping to survive in China’s new era, she falls in briefly with a man who claims to be chasing UFOs – and even appears to have some sort of extra-terrestrial vision herself. Bin, incapacitated by a stroke, returns to Datong, but their relationship is no happier in the long run.As Peter Bradshaw says, this is a “gripping parable for the vanity of human wishes” for all Qiao’s commitment to burning as brightly and fiercely as the white volcanic ash she sees on a far-off mountain-top, it’s her fate to endure disappointment and dismay. And that, I think, is something we can all relate to. APThere was an avalanche of festive films this year, seemingly more than ever with Netflix following in the footsteps of Lifetime and Hallmark by releasing a stocking’s worth of similarly low-budget and low-entertainment Christmas melodramas. But buried underneath the yellow snow, there was a finely wrapped gift, a surprising little gem that delivered a familiar assortment of ingredients but in strangely irresistible packaging. Crudely referred to as a teen Love Actually, Let It Snow focuses on a young, erse ensemble and their romantic misadventures leading up to the big day. There are precisely zero surprises along the way but there’s a wealth of chemistry between the charming cast and director Luke Snellin rises above the platform to craft a film that actually looks like it could be released in cinemas, rather than premiering on your smartphone. I was pleasantly surprised by Let It Snow, especially in comparison to the big-budget theatrical inanity of Emma Thompson’s incompetent Last Christmas, and unlike that film, I can see myself unwrapping this one again next year.

The film’s release has been pushed back more than a year already, but that’s presumably to maximise Hanks’s awards chances for this and the Mister Rogers biopic, A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood. Elisabeth Shue plays his wife Stephen Graham co-stars.Except that Hanks also has this coming up. Six months separate the scheduled releases, but this looks, in many ways, the more obvious silverware shoo-in. Hanks plays Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd, a travelling newspaper reader who must take an orphaned girl (newcomer Helena Zengel) across the country to live with her remaining living relatives in the aftermath of the US civil war. A fictional period cross-generational road movie isn’t obvious Paul Greengrass fodder, which makes this all the more appealing.A strikingly belated second film from Benh Zeitlin, whose Beasts of the Southern Wild was Oscar nominated eight years ago, this is a magic-realist spin on Peter Pan, about a young girl “lost on a mysterious island where time and ageing have become unglued”. Shot on Monserrat, this was co-scripted by Zeitlin’s sister, Eliza.Following standout support in Widows and If Beale Street Could Talk (plus an unsplashy cameo in Joker), Brian Tyree Henry finally gets a key lead. Jennifer Lawrence co-stars. This is the story of a soldier who suffers a traumatic brain injury in Afghanistan, then struggles to readjust to life back home. The director has worked, until now, exclusively in theatre.Mart Crowley’s iconic birthday-party play is brought back to the big screen, this time with the (all-gay) cast of a 2018 Broadway revival, headed by Jim Parsons, Zachary Quinto and Matt Bomer.Colin Firth and Stanley Tucci play a long-term couple touring the north of England in an RV in Harry Macqueen’s second film following his 2014 debut Hinterland. Tucci’s character has been diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s two years prior to the action, so we’re stockpiling tissues for this one. James Dreyfus makes a welcome return to the screen in the supporting cast.This likely won’t be ready in time, as it only shoots this spring, but at a push you could be looking at a Christmas 2020 premiere for Paul Thomas Anderson’s first film since The Phantom Thread. No cast has yet been attached, but we’re getting big Boogie Nights energy from the premise, about a high school student, who is also a successful child actor, in 1970s San Fernando Valley.The relationship of Julie (Honor Swinton Byrne) and her ghastly, charming lover (Tom Burke) is over. What happens next in the life of Joanna Hogg’s alter ego? And will Tilda Swinton play herself (she knew Hogg at the time, in the early 80s) as well as Julie’s mum? The Souvenir was one of 2019’s cinematic highlights this looks set to repeat the trick in 2020.Will Ferrell and Julia Louis-Dreyfus star as a couple whose marriage falters after a misstep on his part during their family skiing holiday.

As an omnivore (admittedly one that ate little meat but a lot of dairy and eggs), I just couldn’t imagine writing recipes week after week with such a strict set of rules, let alone enjoy eating plant-based food on a regular basis. But then, something wonderful happened.Taking meat, fish, dairy or eggs out of cooking became a catalyst for creativity, forcing me, and many other chefs and food writers, to think in new and interesting ways about how to extract the most flavour and pleasure from the same old characters in the vegetable drawer.I discovered that the Asian larder, replete with its fermented and pickled ingredients such as kimchi and miso, could add flavour to meals in an instant. I reacquainted myself with the thrill of pulses and turning dry beans into nourishing meals, and I realised that cakes can be just as rich and fluffy and velvety without dairy and eggs.During the two and a half years that I’ve been writing the column, the innovation in plant-based food in recipe-writing, restaurant menus and even ready meals has been of an unprecedented breadth and scale. Vegan food is an exciting, easier and more delicious way to eat than ever.I am doing Veganuary this year in the main because I want to show you how enjoyable it can be. But also, because what we choose to put on our plates undeniably impacts the world around us. You, however, might be doing it because you feel bloated after the annual Christmas meat-fest or because it’s cheaper than eating meat, for reasons of animal welfare or just because Natalie Portman does it.For whatever reason, I’m here to help you through the next weeks with my meal plans.A few tips. The best advice I can give you is to make a plan of all the things you want to eat. Perhaps write them down here then make a shopping list based on that. If time is not on your side, focus on dinner. Breakfast could be cereal and lunch a throw-together affair involving pitta bread, jarred antipasti and a dollop of hummus. And finally, if a piece of ham should accidentally fall into your mouth this week, get back up and keep on going.I can’t promise a new you after a week, but you might think, like I now do, that plant-based is both achievable and delicious – and that thought may give you the freedom of choice over what you eat, which might just make you feel alive, well and hungry for more.Breakfast is easy – just be sure to stock up on some good vegan milk. My preference is for Oatly because it’s great in tea, coffee and porridge. Anna Jones has your back with this DIY instant porridge (below) or if you’ve got no time in the morning, try making Felicity Cloake’s bircher muesli the night before. Or else, buy granola.

Yet there is no blame or trauma on my part: the tin of prunes in syrup my grandma always kept in the cupboard next to the peaches and pears the bag of teddy bear noses (more on this later) on the shelf or the bowls of soaked prunes, which looked like enormous sea slugs, on whatever sideboard: I liked them all. So black and thick, their sweetness concentrated and almost spicy.Then there were what I thought of as “grown-up” prunes: the tin of stuffed prunes Dad bought Mum for Christmas every year. I now know they were prunes d’Agen, named after a town in Aquitaine in south-west France and stuffed with prune cream. But back then they were simply prunes stuffed with prunes: something I liked, stuffed with more of that thing – only 10 times darker and richer than the tins or the bags. Like a spray of a friend’s mum’s perfume or a swig from a bottle of advocaat, they were even better for being taken illicitly. Like other edible gifts, the tin of prunes used to be kept under the coffee table in the living room. To take one, I would lie on the rug, which meant there was a risk that the sticky prune would, like the toffee Quality Street, collect fluff (this was never a problem).At Christmas, there were also prunes soaked in alcohol that were eaten with roast meat and prunes drowned in red wine, both of which were good. Then, in my 20s, I made Nigella Lawson’s muskily spiced prunes. Poached in earl grey tea with marsala and muscovado sugar, these prunes are, as Nigella promises, pretty damned fabulous, even if made with teddy bear noses (her words) rather than tender-bellied Agen. Nigella also notes that prunes can never win unanimous support, which made me like them even more – who needs complete agreement when you are in tune with Nigella?Eaten while still warm, this pudding is a softly set custard as it cools, it firms up and can be cut into squares (yes, it can be made a day in advance). Prune lovers: you could soak some extra prunes in more warm marsala – and maybe a spoonful of muscovado sugar, too – and leave them in a cut-glass bowl on the sideboard for those who want extra.200ml marsala, warmed20 pitted prunes4 large eggs150g caster sugar50g butter, melted900ml whole milk220g plain flourA pinch of saltButter, for greasingPour the warmed marsala over the prunes and leave to sit for two hours or ideally overnight.

Moyes was let go by co-owners David Gold and David Sullivan after the 2017-18 season despite leading the club to survival and a 13th-place finish.Asked after returning to succeed Manuel Pellegrini if there were any hard feelings, Moyes said: “No, because things were done correctly - I wasn’t taken on and I was told that. I was disappointed, I’ve said that, but I’ve got another chance to go again.“I think it says a lot about the owners, they thought the job I did was good enough to give me another opportunity. This time I’m going to make it so there’s no choice but to renew. There’s a clause in there and I’m going to make it impossible to ignore that, that’s my plan.”Moyes insisted the end to his previous spell at the club was barely discussed when he was approached to return. “It was very simple when they called me,” he said. “They asked me do I want to come back and I said ‘I can’t wait’.“We didn’t talk about the past, we were just talking about the team now, what we have to do and the position we’re in.”Moyes revealed he is still “working on” assembling his backroom staff but he will be joined by Alan Irvine, his assistant in his previous spell at the club.Responding to the section of fans who have questioned his re-appointment and style of play, Moyes defended his record.“What anybody’s getting is a very experienced Premier League manager, I think there’s arguably only two or three more experienced around, and I win,” he said.“There’s a lot of new modern things in football but recently I think you’ve seen signs of things going back a bit. We do want to keep possession but perhaps possession is not now seen, even maybe by yourselves (in the media), as the key to winning games.“The fans want to see more attacking football, action and excitement. The biggest thing I want to see from my team is for the supporters to be excited - I would love that to be the case.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e6476a0660869872238b911f0a1a27c27660157/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd47021d79ea4d31e526613e7a7d1318","title":"football league team of the decade schmeichel sharp","story":"We select our best XI from the players who have shone since 2010, and a manager to lead themSpent four years in the Championship towards the start of the decade, notably helping Leicester City to promotion to the Premier League in 2014. Began era with Sven-Göran Eriksson at Notts County, for whom he kept 24 clean sheets en route to the League Two title, before reuniting with Eriksson at Leicester after impressing at Leeds. Did not miss a minute of league action across three seasons in the second tier with Leicester and remains a key pillar in the Premier League, which he won in 2016.There is no shortage of contenders for the right-back berth, from Chris Gunter to Kieran Trippier and George Baldock to Bruno, but the versatile Leeds United defender gets the nod. The former Arsenal schoolboy has become an integral part of the Leeds squad since signing from Bristol City three years ago. Won promotion to the Championship with Yeovil Town in 2013 and again two years later with City. A marauding full-back who can also operate at centre-back, Ayling has thrived under Marcelo Bielsa.A consistent performer in Sheffield United’s journey from League One to the Premier League and, before that, a reliable holding midfielder for Blackpool in the Championship. Christened “Bashambauer” by Blades supporters because of his roaming runs, the defender, who used to clean Kevin Nolan’s boots at Bolton, has proved one of Chris Wilder’s most trusted allies since joining on a free in 2014. Basham, described by Wilder as “like gold dust”, worked at McDonald’s after being released by Newcastle at 16.An ever-present as Burnley won the Championship in 2016 and central to two promotion-winning seasons in three years under Sean Dyche, who named Mee as his captain in August. Forged a formidable defensive partnership with Michael Keane and since with James Tarkowski, both of whom have earned England honours. Mee, 30, celebrated his 300th appearance in a Burnley shirt this month. “Ben, eventually, could become Steve Bruce, in the sense that it’s well documented Steve never played for England,” Dyche said.Has not always been plain sailing for the Dubliner, notably during a month’s loan in League Two in 2014-15 with Wilder’s Northampton Town. Stevens played four games – four defeats – but left an impression on Wilder. The full-back found himself in the last-chance saloon – his career in England was ailing – but Portsmouth handed him a lifeline in the fourth tier the following summer and Stevens flourished before joining Sheffield United two years ago. Secured promotion under Wilder in May.Another player to progress from League Two to the Premier League, though the midfielder had to bide his time. Has excelled in every rung of the Football League, racking up more than 100 league games for Plymouth in the fourth tier before earning a move to Barnsley, whom he captained to promotion to the Championship three years ago. In January 2017 Steve Bruce, then in charge of Aston Villa, came calling. A standout performer en route to Villa’s promotion in May and now a Republic of Ireland mainstay.Earned his stripes in League One with Walsall, missing only six league games across three seasons after being signed by Dean Smith following his release by West Brom, whom he joined aged seven. A versatile midfielder capable of hoovering up danger or unlocking defences as a No 10, Sawyers was reunited with Smith at Brentford, where he became captain last year before returning home to the Hawthorns in the summer. “If you give him time and space, he’ll destroy you,” said the Brentford co-director Phil Giles.A clever player – Gallagher’s brain has long set him apart from the crowd – and a consistent threat, be it on the right flank in the Championship with Leicester or centrally in League One with Preston. Four years ago Gallagher signed for Preston on a permanent basis after securing promotion to the second tier. A set-piece specialist, particularly from 12 yards, in more recent years Gallagher has dictated from deep. The 35-year-old may be approaching the twilight of his career but remains an evergreen performer.It is an overused word, but Coppinger is a Doncaster Rovers and Football League legend. The winger, who turns 39 in January, has been tormenting full-backs for two decades, let alone one. Coppinger has dazzled defenders in League Two, League One and the Championship and, these days, he is far from merely making up the numbers, having played 51 matches last season. “To still be performing is the biggest thing for me and I still feel really good physically,” Coppinger said.Not bad for a fat lad from Sheffield. Sharp has played for six teams over the past record-breaking 10 years, notably Doncaster, Southampton and Sheffield United, and everywhere he went it rained goals he has scored 147 in the Football League since January 2010. A talisman, Sharp has an unerring knack of being in the right place at the right time and got 23 goals for his boyhood club en route to the Premier League last season. “He just knows where the ball is going to drop,” said Andy Crosby, who has played with and coached Sharp.A decade that began in League Two with Hereford United culminated in the winger being an integral part of Bournemouth’s Championship title-winning campaign four years ago. Along with Matt Ritchie, Pugh tore into defences for fun as Eddie Howe’s side secured two entertaining promotions in three seasons. The 32-year-old helped revive Hull while on loan last season before joining Queens Park Rangers on a free in the summer but, as far as Bournemouth are concerned, Pugh represents £100,000 well spent.Howe may have not managed in the Football League since 2015, but his journey in leading Bournemouth from the foot of League Two to the Premier League in six unforgettable years is impossible to ignore. Chris Wilder’s equally remarkable success with Oxford, Northampton and Sheffield United should not go unnoticed, while John Coleman and Gareth Ainsworth, the longest-serving manager in the country, also deserve immense credit for their work at Accrington and Wycombe respectively."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1192193ea3f371676d5fcd53b066c52e8794291f/0_0_3079_2168/master/3079.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ffd306de101abfcb7c59ef0cf38bdfd9 1400w","title":"are mexican avocados the worlds new conflict commodity","story":"The fruit’s global surge in popularity has fuelled exports and attracted violent cartels to the trade in ‘green gold’The 19 mutilated bodies, nine hanging semi-naked from a bridge in the Mexican city of Uruapan, were initially thought to be the result of a clash between rival drug gangs. But the Jalisco New Generation cartel, which claimed the murders in August, is believed to be fighting for more than drugs. It wants dominance over the local avocado trade.Mexico is the world’s biggest producer of avocados. Exports of the “green gold” from the state of Michoacán, which produces most of Mexico’s avocados, were worth $2.4bn last year.Now, the risk analytics group Verisk Maplecroft has warned in a new analysis that Mexican avocados risk becoming the next “conflict commodity”, akin to “blood diamonds” in Angola and Sierra Leone and conflict minerals in the Democractic Republic of the Congo.The analysis examines a range of factors contributing to the increasing risk profile of Mexican avocados, including the growing involvement of cartels and the associated violence, as well as the use of forced and child labour in farming.It also examines illegal deforestation, illegal logging and forest-clearing for cultivation. The environmental situation has been exacerbated due to cartel activity, “as criminal groups clear protected woodlands to make room for their avocado groves”, according to the report.“The exponential growth of the avocado’s popularity is a mixed blessing for Mexico’s communities and farmers,” Verisk Maplecroft’s Americas analyst, Christian Wagner, says in the report. “While most have benefited from record-breaking prices, many have attracted the attention of organised crime groups that are sinking their teeth into the profits.”He adds: “From cultivation through to transportation, violence and corruption now pervade Mexico’s avocado supply chain – particularly in Michoacán, a long-standing hotbed for criminal violence. The similarities with conflict minerals are striking for companies that source avocados from the region. Association with killings, modern slavery, child labour and environmental degradation is becoming an increasing risk when dealing with Michoacán suppliers and growers, especially when establishing traceability is increasingly hard.”Avocados have been lauded by dieticians for their high nutritional content and “good” fats. In Mexico, the industry is popular because it pays up to 12 times the Mexican minimum wage, according to the study. The country tops the list of world exporters, ahead of the Netherlands, a major non-producing exporting hub, and Peru.Europe’s consumption of avocado stands at 1kg per person per year, according to the Netherlands’ Centre for the Promotion of Imports, while the US consumes four times as much. France is the fruit’s largest market in Europe.In Mexico, the cartels have turned to other activities, most notably avocados, in the face of the government’s tightening war on drugs, Verisk Maplecroft’s Wagner said. They engage “in both extortion and direct cultivation, usually on lands taken over from local farmers or carved out from protected woodlands”.The study notes that “2019 has seen the rise of criminal organisations that behave in every way as drug cartels but are not even engaged in drug trafficking. In Michoacán, the avocado industry is providing the ersified income that criminal groups obtain through fuel theft elsewhere in Mexico.”At least 12 criminal groups are operating in the region. Some local packers and growers have responded by recruiting their own defence forces. But “this increases the risk of both more violence and the potential for human rights abuses”, says the report, and criminal groups often coerce pickers into temporary forced labour.Falko Ernst, International Crisis Group senior analyst for Mexico, said avocados have been a prominent item in Mexican organised crime groups’ portfolio for at least a decade, especially in Michoacán.“It’s not only avocados. Mexican organised crime has long mutated away from ‘just’ drugs trafficking,” he said. “Today, the model is this: you control a given territory, and within in it you exploit whichever commodity is locally available. That includes avocados, but also limes, papayas, strawberries, illegal logging and mining, to name but a few.”Ernst said a boycott of Mexican avocado is not the right response because “we’re talking about a huge sector that sustains thousands of hard-working, peaceful families. A boycott would mean pulling out the rug out from under their feet, and most likely prompt criminal groups to prey on civilians more aggressively yet to make up for lost avocado income.”He added: “What consumers can and should do is voice their expectations toward the companies they buy goods from, to not remain silent bystanders to human rights crises in many of the producing regions in the global south. Governments often ignore their citizens, but if the private sector, if investors, start budging, it’s a whole different story.”Ryan Aherin, senior commodities analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, said there isn’t a simple answer on how consumers should respond.“Avoiding avocados from Mexico altogether might deter greater expansion of criminal activity in the production of Mexican avocados, but cartels are unlikely to abandon the business of producing them without causing greater suffering for local communities,” he said.“Traceability is key to getting these issues under control, but is often easier said than done. The nature of avocado value chains make it difficult, if not impossible, to trace an inidual fruit back to its source.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ae204379daef8efc1a573d972b0dc44c5bffd8f/0_841_2674_1604/master/2674.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ca90d5017131be419a56b1ddf36c42a","title":"britons paying 40 more for energy than in 2015 analysis reveals","story":"Price rises have far outstripped inflation with dual fuel bills costing on average £1,813 a yearComparethemarket’s study examined the costs of energy, home and motor insurance since 2015, and found that gas and electricity price increases were largely responsible for this year’s changes.The cap has led to many providers, particularly the big six – British Gas, EDF Energy, E.ON UK, npower, Scottish Power and SSE – raising their prices.The annual report did not examine the costs of broadband, mobile or TV services, which also involve heavy outlays.Simon McCulloch of comparethemarket said: “A lot of attention during the general election was devoted to financial difficulties that many people face around the UK.“These statistics are a stark reminder of not only the high cost of essential services, but of the huge increases that have been seen in the past few years. The average cost of energy, motor and home insurance is now £675 higher than 2015 – far above the rate of inflation.”The analysis draws attention to the regional disparities in utility costs, finding that London households were paying £3,129 a year – over £400 more than the national average.In contrast, those living in Scotland spend only £2,470 on bills, despite experiencing colder weather than the English capital. Lower bills are largely because of significantly cheaper Scottish car insurance.The West Midlands is the UK’s second most expensive region, with bills averaging £2,910 in 2019.While the cost of car and home insurance has remained broadly unchanged this year, there are indications that motor cover will rise over the next year. Comparethemarket attributes this to mooted delays to reform of personal injury claims for whiplash injuries and changes to the Ogden rate, used to calculate compensation payable to victims of traffic accidents.McCulloch said consumers should always look around for better deals. “With the average saving for these products standing at £482, shopping around clearly goes a long way to mitigating the dramatic bill increases we have seen in recent years,” he said.The energy cap is due to expire by 2023. Ofgem, the government regulator for gas and electricity markets, has previously said “it will be up to the government to consider if the market is working well enough for the cap to be removed”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/811329c08c011664e013b556f6c9b256889f97f6/0_1026_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=945fa3adb24b7b6997dbffde128c39de","title":"vaughan oliver album sleeve design 4ad label pixies cocteau twins","story":"By collapsing history in on itself, designer Vaughan Oliver – who has died aged 62 – created complex images that heightened music by Pixies, Cocteau Twins and moreA good album cover can be a map, a portal or a clue. A guide to the music within a window on an artist’s life, be it glamorous or workaday or something less obvious, an image that might allude to just one element of what’s inside. It can even be a foil to wrongfoot you. Vaughan Oliver sleeves were frequently all of these things at once.The graphic designer, who has died aged 62, created runes to be pored over, adding – in tandem with photographers and type designers – his own potent pre-verbal language to the vocabulary of the musicians he was designing for, primarily on the 4AD label. There were human figures with entire stories to be wondered at: the man on Pixies’ Come on Pilgrim, so hairy as to be transforming the woman suspended in something on the cover of This Mortal Coil’s It’ll End In Tears, be it seawater or starlight the topless flamenco dancer posing for Pixies’ Surfer Rosa, a vision of pure sexuality looked on by a tiny, impotent crucified Jesus on the wall next to her.With these and other monochrome or sepia images, such as David Lynch’s Good Day Today, there’s a kind of corrupted Victoriana, as if the holy images of Julia Margaret Cameron have been scuffed by sin. Take Red House Painters’ Down Colorful Hill: a stark single bed that seems to invite death and sex rather than sleep. (Oliver himself noted the “pubic triangle” of flowers at the bed’s head.)But Oliver could do Technicolor with equal confidence. Sex rears up again on the cover of the Breeders’ Pod. Oliver himself, blurred by a long exposure, thrusts a bunch of phalluses upwards from his waist, but the wash of watercolour behind him softens the comedy. Lush would have their bright sleeves populated with the almost cliched stuff of breezy surrealism – lemons, lampshades – as well as what look like blurry strings of DNA. Oliver’s designs for Cocteau Twins are some of his most purely expressive, as sweeps of colour or arrangements of ice and flowers perfectly encapsulate the band’s hazy romance.With this rich, contradictory blend of styles, Oliver created a mythic space to lounge away from the the neat forward march of history, heightened by his freewheeling use of typography. He was fond of clusters of clashing typefaces, in which traditional serifs or creepy scrawls would sit next to cooler, contemporary fonts in little aesthetic scuffles. As with the work of book designer Chip Kidd, there’s a very 90s kind of ironic propriety to his prim vintage serif fonts – when paired with the abstracted violent oddness of the imagery on Modern English’s Ricochet Days, the effect is of someone barely papering over their perversion.These are vivid sensations that are triggered totally outside the music. As the writer Joy Press tweeted after Oliver’s death, the designer “made buying records a truly voluptuous experience … something that’s hard to explain to those of the streaming generation”. Oliver added so much to the music that his death is the starkest reminder of what is being lost in the transfer away from physical media. The consolidation of Instagram as our definitive social network and the ongoing health of fashion editorial mean that visual culture around music is absolutely not dying out, but a record sleeve knits together music and art in such a potent way. The sleeve is a curtain to be pulled up and walked through – it is the threshold of the record. Little wonder that Oliver has professed his love for the prog sleeves of the 70s designed by, among others, Hipgnosis. Like them, his design tells you that you’re about to go on a journey. With streaming, you’re suddenly teleported in without a map.Even if sleeves do become less important, Oliver’s legacy is assured. He is a key influence on a whole strain of late-century design, pre-empting cyberpunk, grunge, David Fincher, Wired magazine that whole end-of-history nexus where digital culture was making aesthetics collapse into themselves. And, while so many graphic designers tend towards minimalism, legibility and austerity, Oliver honoured the intense beauty and boisterous psychosexual energy of the 4AD gang with complex, glutted images.“We didn’t want to join in we wanted to stand out and fuck things up,” he once said. Stare at a Vaughan Oliver sleeve design, and your safe world starts to shake."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32573a29faa9ce05d1e3aea4130aa850a1bd75a4/0_43_1494_896/master/1494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2b62635d5e42fdf7cc780ce9c1230c2","title":"abandoned at sea the cargo crew adrift without wages fuel or supplies a look back","story":"This week we are returning to some of our favourite episodes from 2019.

Not only is twenty-twenty already a bona fide word in the dictionary, but once a month next year there will be a moment in the evening when the time is:I know! Peak vigesimal! What a score! Let’s celebrate with some puzzles:1) How can someone born in 2020 be older than someone born in 2019?2) Imagine 2020 is not a year but a rugby score, as I’ve scrawled below. This score spells out a word. Can you work out which one?3.1) Every year in this column I try to find the most attractive equation that counts down to the new year. In other words, fill in the blanks in the following equation so it makes arithmetical sense:You are allowed to use any of the basic mathematical operations, +, –, x, ÷, and as many brackets as you like. An answer might look something like (10 – 9 + 8) x (7 – 6 – 5)(4 + 3 + 2 + 1)  2020, but not this one since the equation is incorrect.There are many solutions. I’ll give a copy of my puzzle book So You Think You’ve Got Problems? to the solution I think is the most elegant. You can either tweet me or email me your equations.3.2) The numbers guru Inder J Taneja, a retired maths professor from Brazil, alerted me recently to a new New Year challenge: how to create the year using a single digit. For example, here is how you make 2020 using only 9s.Can you make 2020 using only 1s? Or using only 2s? Or using only any one of the other non-zero digits? The rules are that you cannot use any of the digits more than ten times in each of the equations. You can use all the basic operations, brackets, exponentiation, i.e. you can use a term like 22, and (as shown above) you can concatenate by putting digits together. At least one equation is possible for every digit from 1-9.If you like patterns like this, do check out Professor Taneja’s treasure trove of numerical curiosities. He says: “Whenever I see a number anywhere, it has now become my natural instinct to search for patterns in that number. I spend time on this aspect because I like it. To me it is similar to what art is to an artist and what meditation is to a yogi. The appealing aspect is the mesmerising power of multiple permutation combinations which are possible, which makes me realise the incredible power of the universe and keep me grounded.”I’ll be back at 5pm UK time today with the solutions.My latest book is So You Think You’ve Got Problems?, a compendium of 150 puzzles and the stories behind them.

I wasn’t selecting them because they were necessarily the biggest moments or the greatest stars – it was purely because I liked them as pictures and some had nice stories attached. What jumped out at me when choosing them is there should be far more sportswomen featured. The amount of women’s sport I cover has gradually increased but if I get to do a decade round-up in 2029, I want there to be a far more even balance between the sexes.The start of the decade brought freezing temperatures across Britain. This caused carnage with the fixture list so my mind turned to finding a sport that was thriving in the sub-zero temperatures. I discovered that for the first time since 1997 organised skating races were being held on a flooded field in the Fens. Luckily for me it was a beautiful day and produced scenes that reminded me of a Bruegel painting. It was hard to believe I was in the heart of England. The event hasn’t happened since.Taken at one of my favourite events of the year, this sums up the atmosphere at the Cheltenham Festival. Wherever you look there are pictures to be had both on the course and off. I spotted these two ladies and waited, hoping they would react in some way or another. Luckily for me but unluckily for horse and rider, a horse careered through the railings. Fortunately, everyone emerged unscathed.Team pursuit qualifying lasts for more than an hour with teams competing against the clock one at a time. Not exactly thrilling stuff but it meant I had plenty of time to play with slow shutter speeds and lighting. I placed a strobe on the inside of the track and worked on different combinations of slow shutter speed and either keeping the camera still as the cyclists passed or reverse panning. I don’t often get the opportunity to experiment like this during a top event it was a chance to create virtually my own little studio and have some fun.As the Swansea team gathered for their huddle before kick-off, their young mascot looked disgruntled to be left out. It’s highly unusual to get a sweet, soft picture such as this at a high-profile Premier League match. I remember it was far better than any of the action pictures I took that game.In the middle of the penalty shootout, Chelsea were trailing. The players looked dejected except Didier Drogba, who had rescued his side with a late equaliser in normal time. He started to pray. Maybe this paid off as Bayern Munich missed two penalties, leaving Drogba to score the winning spot-kick. Penalty shootouts are great for pictures but very hard to photograph as you need cameras pointing in various places at the same time. There are so many decisions to make quickly and, with such high stakes, you don’t want to make the wrong choice.This was the day Chris Hoy beat Steve Redgrave’s record to become Britain’s greatest Olympian in terms of gold medals. So I wanted to illustrate this by going tight on his face and the beautiful medal. It was imperative to get a dark background that showed off the medal to its best. He is such a gentleman that after posing for the photos he thanked us all. Not many top sportsmen do that.When setting up for the final session of athletics in the main stadium, I knew the story of the night would be if Mo Farah completed the historic double of 10,000m and 5,000m victories. I managed to bag a decent spot for a tight shot of him crossing the line, so I set up a remote camera with a wider angle designed specifically to include a lot of the crowd. As the race was run at 7.30pm I knew there would be plenty of daylight to light up the stands. I was trying to create a frame that wasn’t just about an inidual winning. More I wanted a feeling of national jubilation, a united Britain, celebrating the wonderful achievements of a Somali immigrant. I look back at this frame now and wonder how times have changed.Just after finishing her race and realising she had won, Ellie Simmonds started to sob. She had been in a titanic battle with the American Victoria Arlen, definitely the best race I saw at the Aquatics Centre that summer. The then teenager was one of the faces of the London Paralympics and endured enormous pressure after being so successful in Beijing four years earlier.In September that year, the Hillsborough Independent Panel revealed for the first the full scale of the establishment cover-up of the 1989 disaster. Liverpool’s following home game was against Manchester United. Just before kick-off the Kop formed a mosaic. I stood right next to the goal so I could shoot straight into the Kop as the players lined up to start.Sir Alex Ferguson gestures to Manchester United’s fans immediately after the 5-5 draw at West Brom – his final match before retiring. I wanted to get in very close to his face, so I put a 1.4x converter on my 500mm lens. I should have known Fergie wouldn’t shed a tear, he is far too hard for that. But I liked this determined and strong final pose as his players applauded behind him. Unfortunately for me this day will also be remembered for the local steward who placed himself in front of Ferguson as he bowed on the pitch thus ruining it for the mass of photographers. He then went on to shake the United manager’s hand. You can imagine the earful we gave that steward afterwards.Early that day I was interviewed by Wimbledon TV and asked how I would react if Andy Murray won. I said I didn’t quite know and didn’t really want to know I tried to block it out of my mind by saying Novak Djokovic would be victorious. This was me trying to take my own emotions out of the final. So that afternoon, when my prediction was proved decisively wrong, I reverted to auto-pilot, using my experience of covering nearly 20 finals there. This is one of my favourites – the expression on his face, picked out by the sunlight as he finally gets his hands on the famous trophy, a mixture of relief, joy and possibly disbelief. I look back at this and think that day was really something special.Australian batsman Peter Siddle lobs a catch straight to Jimmy Anderson at mid-off to give England the match and victory in the series. A few minutes earlier I was positioned straight on to the wicket at ground level where most of the other photographers were, when the most gorgeous evening light broke through threatening storm clouds. The view at Durham, over the pitch and across to Lumley Castle, is one of the best in cricket so I took a gamble and moved into the stands. As the final wicket fell I got this picture. My next frame was completely blocked by the arms of celebrating spectators.It was the day after the infamous Suárez bite in the Uruguay v Italy World Cup match. So as the controversy started to engulf the tournament, I headed back to a strange advert I had noticed a couple of weeks earlier, hopeful that something may be happening there. I wasn’t disappointed it was great fun seeing fans from all over the world posing in different ways. I shot the pictures and filed them quickly. The response on social media to that simple gallery was amazing. Apparently it was even trending on Twitter in Paris.I managed to blag a shooting position right ‘by the tin’ shooting low down through the glass wall. As the final went on, I shifted position from the forehand side to the backhand. I realised by putting my lens right up against a glass-supporting strut in front of me I could achieve an amazing reflection. It wasn’t like a mirror, which is opaque, as you could also see through it. All I had to do was wait for the action to occur in exactly the right spot. I have been accused of tampering with this image in Photoshop. I admit it’s hard to work out but I swear it hasn’t been altered. Firstly, I am not allowed by my editorial code to do that but I’m also rubbish at Photoshop and don’t posses the necessary skills. Also this final was tight on deadline which meant I had to file immediately after the match, giving me no time for any retouching.It was a golden, sunlit evening in Glasgow, a rare occurrence that I had to make the most of. For a couple of hours I walked around the stadium, working on angles, trying to find the best spots to shoot the lengthening shadows. Luckily the 10,000m final was at exactly the right time. The light was perfect for only a few laps before the sun disappeared behind the back of the stands.When I headed off to the first day of the inaugural Invictus Games, I wasn’t sure what to make of it. But when I saw this veteran with one arm missing, a scar down the side of his face and distinctive contact lenses, I knew I could get a striking image. Lying down behind the shot put circle enabled me to shoot up and use the cloudy sky as a clean background. I also had the lens wide open to throw all the focus on to that amazing, determined face.Rafael Nadal was struggling to beat a low-ranked opponent during an early round on the No 1 Court. It was the hottest day of the year and I had noticed at the change of ends how the sweat was pouring off him while reaching down to pick up a drink by his chair. By putting a converter on my lens I could get in really tight to his face, isolating the drops.Like everyone else that day, I was expecting an easy Springbok victory. The ground at Brighton was very cramped and, as Japan had many photographers there, I was quite happy to plump for a position shooting South Africa attack for both halves. I just couldn’t believe it, watching the winning try from the other end of the pitch. Luckily getting this picture helped soothe the disappointment of not being in the right place in the final minute.I have a well-rehearsed plan at the Grand National – one that gives me as many angles and viewpoints as possible. Part of this strategy involves putting a couple of remote cameras at the largest fence on the course. That year I had a camera placed either side of the landing area. It was a filthy day, which meant the ground was soft and the horses were tiring. Luckily one of the remotes captured the moment Nina Carberry flew off her horse Sir Des Champs. For 25 years I had photographed the Chair during the Grand National, hoping one day my perseverance would pay off, and that day it did: this frame won best sports picture at the World Press Photo awards.From my position, low down and by the dug-outs, I knew I wouldn’t have a good angle to achieve an historic reminder of the final game. So I managed to get permission to clamp a remote camera high up on the scaffolding supporting the temporary TV studio. Here I could see it all – the ground, the pitch, the players, the lights, the fans. It was a huge stroke of luck for me that the final and winning goal, scored by West Ham’s Winston Reid, happened at the right end. As I always try to say to myself: “If you don’t try you never get.”This made me laugh. Seeing a solitary England fan, dressed proudly in his replica kit from the early 90s, marooned amongst a sea of proud, scarlet-clad Welshmen. I just wish I’d seen his reaction when England scored their winning goal. England may have been victorious that day but they departed the tournament in disgrace losing to Iceland, while Wales went on to the dizzy heights of the semi-finals.Without doubt my favourite woman to photograph. I have found it very difficult to pick out my best image of Serena from the last decade. Eventually I plumped on this one, her beating Angelique Kerber in the Wimbledon final of 2016. I wanted a picture that demonstrated her power, strength and determination. On Centre Court some photographers have fantastic seats, low down and very close to the action. When Serena doesn’t hold back like this you can really feel the force.This is Britain’s Tom Daley and Daniel Goodfellow competing outside at the Maria Lenk Aquatics Centre. Above the top board I noticed a load of scaffolding and metal poles. It looked really messy, almost as if the ers were jumping off a building site. Poor planning and a lack of money meant many venues had a half-finished feel to them. The weather that day was a bit overcast with the sun struggling to break through. I wanted a bit of colour to this picture so I tweaked the colour balance of my camera to warm it up and give this smoggy feel.Olympic fencing is one of my favourite events to cover. It is theatrically and dramatically lit which means photographers can have a lot of fun experimenting with exposures and shutter-speeds. Also it’s not one of the high-profile events where the pressure is on not to miss a vital moment. I managed to work out how I could combine in the camera two frames in a striking multiple exposure. The colours of the different pistes, allied with the contrasting angles, created an image that reminded me of the Union Jack. It was just a matter of time and practice before finally getting the fencers in the right place.The diminutive Fan Yilin from China competes on the beam during the apparatus finals in Rio. She is only 4ft 10in tall so I deliberately shot this image with a wider view to emphasise her tiny frame especially when leaping high. Gymnastics is one of those sports I rarely get to photograph, so it’s refreshing to work on something different.I had seen images taken with infrared cameras by landscape photographers and had noticed how it rendered colours, especially greens, in a unique fashion. Knowing Wimbledon was a sea of greens, I thought it might be interesting to see what could happen. I also wanted to show a place that is so familiar in a very different, almost surreal way. I got a normal Canon 7D camera which had the sensor adapted to read only infrared light and then produced a gallery of images taken around the grounds during the fortnight. In this image of Court Two, the eventual women’s champion Garbiñe Muguruza is volleying against Angelique Kerber.The Belgian Olympic heptathlon champion, Nafi Thiam, was a model of consistency, easily winning her competition at the world championships. Her long braided hair makes for great pictures, but it’s especially graphic in the high jump. For me it was just a case of getting the background clean and waiting for the sun to come out so as to light up her face and hair perfectly.It was Usain Bolt’s final race before retirement and everyone expected him to go out in a blaze of glory. I was tracking him as he sprinted down the home straight when suddenly he pulled up with an injury. It was a sad end for such a huge global superstar, an athlete who has provided so many amazing moments for me as well as the sporting public.Recently I wrote an article welcoming back José after being appointed Spurs manager. In it I mentioned this picture and how one of my Twitter followers compared it to the Caravaggio painting The Taking of Christ. That tweet went a bit crazy for a while. I thought that bizarre enough but this month the tale had another quirky twist. Again on Twitter I was told this picture, or rather Caravaggio’s, was a perfect example of the Fibonacci spiral. He was a famous 12th century Italian mathematician who invented the Fibonacci sequence which stated each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. This applied to art is an expression of the Rule of Thirds – a principle that gives a more appealing flow to an image. What makes this even stranger is the person telling me about Fibonacci was Carol Decker, the lead singer of the 80s pop group T’Pau!More than five months later and I still can’t believe what I witnessed that day at Lord’s. Compiling this decade review has given me the chance to revisit some wonderful moments – but nothing compares to this. For sheer sporting drama it takes the gold medal. England beating New Zealand to win the World Cup off the very last ball of a super over, with the teams tied after 50 overs each. I remember taking a deep breath before that final ball, trying to get my heart rate down, and then just trusting my instincts. Fortunately the run-out happened at the right end for me and I managed to get it.This was a day of mixed emotions for me. For obvious reasons I had wanted England to win the final but I always try to put personal feelings aside when I’m shooting a game – it’s my job to be a neutral observer. The key picture, as it so often is, was the trophy lift. This one had far greater significance. Siya Kolisi, the first black player to captain his country, raising the Webb Ellis Cup aloft. For many years rugby was the sport of the white minority, with black players banned from playing under the apartheid regime. Kolisi had been born into extreme poverty but here he was lifting the trophy up and becoming an inspiration, a beacon of hope for a troubled country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f637506dc462393cbacdcef86be40c700e933a1/0_83_4589_2753/master/4589.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5100c98780bad177efd92bae3da5355","title":"predictions 2020 team gb medal england euro hopes","story":"Visions of another record Olympic medal tally are unrealistic while Gareth Southgate’s men are likely to peak after Euro 2020A decade ago, Observer Sport Monthly tried to imagine what sport would look like in 2020. China, it daringly predicted, would be on the verge of Olympic rugby sevens gold. Snooker would be dead, Formula One on life support. Oh, and Cristiano Ronaldo would have a team named after him. True, the much-missed magazine got a few things right, including boxing’s renaissance, but its January 2010 issue mainly served to highlight the perils of being a sporting soothsayer. So, with that in mind, it’s time to polish my own crystal ball, cross my fingers, and offer up some guesses for 2020 and beyond.At the 2016 Rio Games, Team GB did what pretty much everyone thought was impossible by bettering their London 2012 performance, with a staggering 27 golds and 67 podium finishes lifting them to second in the medal table. Yet, incredibly, UK Sport’s performance director, Chelsea Warr, is “quietly confident” Britain can do even better in Tokyo.I can’t see it. Yes, UK Sport’s budget and tech resources remain the envy of the world, and such as Adam Peaty, Dina Asher-Smith and Laura Kenny are likely to be multiple medallists. But most experts believe a drop-off is more likely given the rise of China and Japan. And do you know what? If GB’s medal haul ends up being closer to 50 than 70 we should be intensely relaxed about it. There will still be enough ra-ra to go round. Honour will be satisfied. And given spending millions on elite sport doesn’t drive participation levels, whether Team GB come second or fifth in the medal table will have little discernible effect on the wider population.When is an Olympic ban not an Olympic ban? When it involves Russia. Barring a fresh doping bust I expect hundreds of Russian athletes will be cleared to compete in Tokyo, despite the country’s recent global ban. In fact here is a prediction: the size of the not-Russia-Russian team will exceed the 282 who turned up at Rio.Few may have heard of the 41-year-old New Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard but, barring injury or other unforeseen circumstances, that will change in Tokyo as Hubbard is likely to become the first transgender athlete to compete at an Olympic Games. Given Hubbard finished fourth in the 87kg+ snatch competition at the 2019 world championships, a medal could be even on the cards. Whatever happens, expect the thorny issue of transgender athletes to get even more pointed in the 2020s – with the policies of governing bodies, who are trying to juggle “fairness” with “inclusivity”, being increasingly challenged in the courts. How much the emerging scientific evidence informs the debate is another intriguing factor.Are Gareth Southgate’s side capable of winning Euro 2020? Of course. Should they be the bookies’ favourites? Hmm, maybe. Sure, England will benefit from a kindly group draw and home advantage but it seems odd they are only 4-1 for glory, when world champions France are 13-2 and Belgium are 7-1.England’s path to the final certainly does not appear straightforward. Win Group D and they are likely to face Germany, France, or Portugal in the last 16, Spain in the quarters and the Netherlands in the last four. Finish second and Sweden, France, and then Belgium could block their paths. That isn’t one banana skin rather a whole plantation.True England’s attacking talent is the envy of the world but will the question marks over their centre-halves, goalkeeper and deep-lying playmaker be solved in the next six months? With that in mind, we may not see the best of England until later in the decade.Quick quiz question: When did Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic first end the year as the top three in the world? Well done to anyone who said 2007. It is also now over three years since a grand slam was won by anyone outside the big three. Yet in 2020 Djokovic will be 33, Nadal 34 and Federer 39. Age has to catch up with them at some point, especially as the challengers are getting closer. Dominic Thiem and Daniil Medvedev reached the French and US Open finals respectively. Stefanos Tsitsipas won the end-of-year ATP final. The 20-year-old Canadian Denis Shapovalov and the 18-year-old Italian Jannik Sinner also have immense promise. Chuck in the fact Olympic years can be squirly and there could well be a new name on a grand slam trophy.During the 2020s we will surely see the first English footballer come out while still playing. A female manager or head coach of a major men’s sports team is also in play – although Britain lags far behind the US. The NBA, for instance, has 11 full-time female assistant coaches, while the NFL has 10. And given Becky Hammon, the assistant coach of the San Antonio Spurs, was interviewed for the Milwaukee Bucks job in 2017, the shattering of this particular glass ceiling may be closer than we imagine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49440ad301f510ab8e39d587ab807a05cb41ddd5/0_291_4024_2414/master/4024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=262fbd092fc65864db8d1d4d3772816f","title":"talking horses gordon elliotts christmas blitz augurs well cheltenham festival horse racing tips","story":"Gordon Elliott finished clear of his major rivals with no fewer than four top-level wins while Epatante was the biggest market mover and is now clear favourite for the Champion HurdleAll three registered Grade One wins at the Christmas meetings, but Elliott finished clear of his major rivals with no fewer than four top-level wins, while his Roaring Bull also took the spoils in the Paddy Power Handicap Chase, the most valuable race of the entire four-day Leopardstown Festival, which did his hopes of finally taking the Irish trainers’ title from Mullins no harm at all. Mullins weighed in with two Grade Ones, including Faugheen’s win at Limerick on Boxing Day while much of the attention among British fans was focused on Kempton, with Henderson saddling Epatante to win the Christmas Hurdle at Kempton.Michael O’Leary, Elliott’s biggest benefactor over the years, is slowly winding up his bloodstock operations, but the stable is sure to remain a force for several years yet. Delta Work’s win in the Savills Chase was particularly encouraging as there were none of the fencing errors that have held him back in the past and he will be a major player in the Gold Cup at Cheltenham with a similar round of jumping.Among the yard’s other Grade One runners, it was hard to draw any conclusions from Battleoverdoyen’s defeat of two rivals in a Grade One novice chase that lost four of its declared runners in the hours before the race, including Minella Indo, the marginal second-favourite. But in finishing within a length of his stable companion, Champagne Class showed enough to suggest that he is a very live candidate for the National Hunt Chase and Elliott seemed in little doubt afterwards that it is the ideal race for him in March.For Mullins, it was more of a mixed bag over Christmas. Faugheen’s defeat of Samcro was a remarkable achievement for both horse and trainer given that the 11-year-old had made his chasing debut only a few weeks earlier. If he can back it up in the Grade One novice at the Dublin Racing Festival in early February, a ticket to see him run at Cheltenham, four years after winning the Champion Hurdle, will be one of the hottest of the week.Sharjah’s win in Sunday’s Grade One Matheson Hurdle was welcome too, but Klassical Dream, last year’s Supreme Novice Hurdle winner, finished last in the same race while Kemboy, the winner 12 months ago, was another beaten favourite in the Savills Chase. Chacun Pour Soi, the ante-post favourite for the Champion Chase, also failed to deliver at odds-on when only second behind A Plus Tard in Friday’s feature race.Given the ownership problems which saw Kemboy and other horses owned by the Supreme Racing Club banned from racing earlier in the year, however, Mullins will have been pleased to see Kemboy racing at all and he did more than enough in finishing a length behind Delta Work to keep alive hopes of a return to the Cheltenham Gold Cup, in which he unseated his jockey at the first last season. Chacun Pour Soi too was returning from 239 days off and travelled like a top-notcher for much of the way before the effort started to tell in the closing stages. Both chasers should get another chance to set themselves up for the Festival over the next few weeks.Sharjah’s success also advanced his Festival claims, but the biggest mover in the Champion Hurdle market after his race on Sunday was Epatante, whose odds were cut from 4-1 to 3-1 thanks to Klassical Dream’s failure to beat a single opponent home. Henderson also successfully launched the hurdling career of Mister Coffey, one of last year’s best bumper horses, at Newbury on Saturday, though he has so much speed that Aintree could prove to be his track rather than Cheltenham.For Paul Nicholls, Christmas brought an 11th King George as Clan Des Obeaux beat his stable companion Cyrname, and the champion trainer will now spend two-and-a-half months being asked whether he thinks the seven-year-old will show the same level of form in the Gold Cup and trying endless variations on “there’s only one way to find out”. The bookies remain unconvinced – he is an 8-1 shot behind Al Boum Photo, last year’s winner, and Kemboy – and many punters will feel the same come the day, as Clan Des Obeaux is likely to go straight to Cheltenham.Similar comments apply to Allmankind, an 8-1 shot for the Triumph Hurdle, as his tearaway win in the Grade One juvenile hurdle at Chepstow could be a difficult trick to repeat against even tougher company at the Festival. In Ireland, meanwhile, Henry de Bromhead’s return of five winners, including two Grade Ones, at Leopardstown and Limerick was further evidence that he is narrowing the gap to Mullins and Elliott.Notebook’s defeat of Fakir D’Oudairies in the Grade One novice chase on Boxing Day was particularly impressive and it is a surprise to find the two horses still locked together on 6-1 at the top of the Arkle Trophy betting. As the Christmas programme recedes into the rear-view, that looks a price that is well worth taking.Cheltenham on New Year’s Day is the next major date in the jumping schedule but the action today is well above par for a midwinter Monday with almost £200,000 in prize money on offer across two cards at Haydock and Taunton.The feature event at Taunton is a Listed mares’ hurdle and *Silver Forever* (2.25) could be the bet here to beat likely favourite Marie’s Rock. Her win at Newbury in early November is the pick of the form on offer and while she was a little below that level next time up, she has had a month off since and will take plenty of beating at anything close to her best.Kilcrea Bridge (2.55) is on a decent mark and should progress from his promising return to action last month while Lord Du Mesnil (2.00) and The Con Man (2.35) have solid chances at Haydock. Fizzy Feet (1.40), steadily progressive in recent weeks and back to winning form last time out, looks the best bet on the Flat at Lingfield."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53cb3e563e7dd472b72b2cb2e9ddfb850c669da0/1827_1020_3435_2061/master/3435.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52d0ef8963a260be3dd0c9a2db241878","title":"enter stage right 12 theatre stars for 2020","story":"Who will have audiences on the edge of their seats in the new year? Laurie Kynaston, Rosie Sheehy, Michelle Tiwo and Sadie Clark are among a dozen dazzling talents to watchOne of the uniformly excellent soccer squad in The Wolves at Stratford East in 2018 (she played stoner midfielder #13), Sheehy made her RSC debut this year in King John. It’s one of Shakespeare’s most unloved, underperformed plays, but Sheehy, a Rada graduate from Port Talbot, was sensational as the unruly ruler. First seen bleary-eyed, knocking back a raw egg while in her pyjamas, she plays the first half as if the king’s simmering rage is entwined with an unshakable hangover. It runs at the Swan in Stratford until 21 March – beware the food fight if you sit in the front row.The Son, Florian Zeller’s devastating conclusion to his gripping family trilogy, gave Laurie Kynaston a role to fulfil the promise he had already shown in Jez Butterworth’s The Ferryman and (as a young Johnny Marr) in the film England Is Mine. Audiences arriving at the Kiln theatre were greeted with the sight of Kynaston writing on the walls, his scribbles as indecipherable as the depression that desperately engulfs his character, Nicolas, after his parents’ separation. His forthcoming projects include the film How to Build a Girl, based on Caitlin Moran’s book, playing the brother of Beanie Feldstein’s heroine.The new artistic director at the Unicorn started his tenure by directing a trio of tales about the trickster spider Anansi that was a masterclass in direct, no-fuss storytelling for a young audience. His opening season, loosely built around the idea of imagining new possibilities, has plenty of enticing productions to come, including Lulu Raczka’s retelling of Gulliver’s Travels in a school gym, Roland Schimmelpfennig’s characteristically knotty The Bee in Me and a collaboration by Sarah Argent and Guy Rhys, Robotology, which wonders what it might be like to be friends with a robot.When Racheal Ofori performed So Many Reasons at Camden People’s theatre at the start of 2018, her star quality burned as brightly as the show’s neon lighting design, which somehow managed to combine a vagina, a mango and the Virgin Mary. There was clearly many a reason why Ofori should be a household name: her touring one-woman show about sex and religion was full of charisma, comedic ability and candour. Currently at the National Theatre in Inua Ellams’ take on Three Sisters, Ofori takes So Many Reasons to Soho theatre in March.You’d be forgiven for expecting any debut monologue performed in a tiny venue at the Edinburgh festival fringe to be a bit rough around the edges. But Sadie Clark’s Algorithms – billed as a “bisexual Bridget Jones for the Fleabag generation” – was astonishingly assured and practically broadcast-ready. Developed at Soho Theatre Writers’ Lab, it’s sweet, sad and, as performed by Clark herself, full of heart – with more than a touch of Miranda Hart too. By rights it should have reached Fleabag-sized audiences by next summer.Triple threat doesn’t begin to cover Michelle Tiwo, the poet, actor, musician and podcaster who co-founded the Sistren broadcasting collective. Tiwo’s autobiographical work, including a contribution to And the Rest of Me Floats at the Bush theatre, often explores black queer visibility. Tiwo gave a magnetic performance as the teen uprooted from London to Margate in the raucous Parakeet at the Edinburgh fringe and in April will be co-curating Inua Ellams’ poetry night at the Barbican, riffing on John Singleton’s classic movie Boyz N the Hood.Anisha Fields is a designer whose sets keep on giving: you never know what they’ll reveal next. I Wish I Was a Mountain, an adaptation of a Hermann Hesse fairytale at Bath’s Egg in 2018, used a host of houses big and small to recreate a town’s fair. Homes popped up inside books, sand poured out of chimneys, roofs hid all sorts of surprises. This Christmas, she dreamed up a hands-on wonderland set for the Egg’s studio show Squirrel, drawing on Bauhaus designs to create a series of cones, tubes and geometric shapes that kept the young audience spellbound and created an enchanted forest scene.At the heart of Ned Bennett’s electrifying revival of Equus at Stratford East was the astonishing achievement of movement director Shelley Maxwell, who helped six actors morph into horses. Peter Shaffer, in the play’s preface, raised the danger that the performers playing the animals may convey the “cosy familiarity of a domestic animal – or worse, a pantomime horse”. No chance of that in Maxwell’s ferocious, haunting moves which stayed with you longer than any speech in the play. Maxwell, also a dancer and choreographer, went on to work on “Master Harold” … and the Boys at the National.Sarah Frankcom is a truly hard act to follow but her young successors, who now share the top job at Manchester’s formidable Royal Exchange, are perfectly placed. Both Roy Alexander Weise and Bryony Shanahan have established themselves as sharp directors – he with Nine Night and The Mountaintop, she with Bitch Boxer and Queens of the Coal Age. Together they plan to make work “with and for the people of Manchester”: Shanahan’s Wuthering Heights at the Exchange should be something special, while a freelance gig finds Weise reviving Roy Williams’ Sucker Punch in London.These two Belgian performance-makers – Brouyaux is based in Brussels, Guisset in Berlin – staged the most arresting duet I saw in 2019. De la Poésie, du Sport, etc has the pair clad in mix-and-match sportswear as they race through a number of scenarios exploring competition, fear, expectation and the difficulty of staying in sync both with those around you and with yourself. One minute it’s a track-and-field thriller, the next a Little Red Riding Hood chiller. This is a performance that’s so packed full of ideas it demands the audience keep up to speed. It’s on tour in Europe and deserves a UK date in 2020."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da31420921c0b1924c450a60b2395a5e9343bb32/21_585_2229_1337/master/2229.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f9159b35aa12b0452366dfca7125b9b","title":"tesla delivers first china made cars from shanghai factory","story":"First 15 Model 3 electric cars go to employees and US firm will ramp up production in 2020Tesla has delivered the first vehicles it has made in China, marking a major milestone in the electric carmaker’s global expansion efforts.The first 15 Model 3 cars to roll off the line at the US carmaker’s Shanghai factory went to customers who were Tesla employees and were handed over in a ceremony at the plant on Monday.Tesla will ramp up production during January, marking the start of a full-on assault on the world’s largest car market. It has taken less than a year from the start of construction of the $5bn (£3.8bn) Shanghai factory in January to the delivery of the first vehicles.The factory, announced in July 2018, is Tesla’s first facility outside the US and will have an annual capacity of 150,000 Model 3 cars per year, compared with 350,000 in its main factory in Fremont, California.Tesla is aiming for China to become the largest market for its Model 3, outstripping the US. China is already the largest market for mid-sized premium sedans that rival the Model 3, according to IHS Markit data cited by the carmaker.“From now onwards, China-made Model 3 vehicles will start running on China’s large streets and small lanes,” Tesla’s vice-president, Tao Lin, said.The carmaker will enter a crowded field, with some reports suggesting there are hundreds of companies aiming to mass-produce electric cars. However, industry insiders expect many of these to fail and a recent slump in Chinese car sales has caused severe difficulties for some of the more established names. For electric carmakers the general slump has been exacerbated by cuts to government subsidies.The subsidy cuts prompted the Warren Buffett-backed electric carmaker BYD to slash its profit forecasts in October. Nio, a premium carmaker pitched as a direct rival to Tesla, was forced to raise $200m in September from its chief executive and major shareholder, Tencent, in response to deepening losses.Tesla has bet billions of dollars on China, with its Shanghai factory opening well ahead of another planned “gigafactory” in Berlin, its first in Europe.Tesla claims its Model 3 pricing will put it on a similar level to fossil fuel-powered mid-sized sedans, even before gas savings and other benefits. Shanghai will also produce Tesla’s Model Y crossover SUV, which is built using the same platform as the Model 3. Model Y deliveries are scheduled for the summer of 2020."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e7a9defb57cafa1b130d2ed2dc8e2f9d4744a11/130_0_4028_2417/master/4028.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d57b8226e29098ef39abdb4d70d5b29","title":"charles dickens london walk walking tour","story":"Fagin’s den, the blacking factory and the writer’s house are among the sites visited on our expert’s Charles Dickens walking tour of London. Wot larks!Let’s start at the end. On 14 June 1870, the body of Charles Dickens was lowered into Poets’ Corner in Westminster Abbey, watched by perhaps a dozen mourners. His friend, Wilkie Collins, was among them, but there was no place for Dickens’ estranged wife, Catherine. Dickens had wanted to be buried near his home in Kent, with no fuss, but he’d lost control of his own story. He was 58 years old – and the brass lettering on his black tombstone still glows with unquenchable force.Dickens loved to walk, at speed, often through the night. Follow him past the Houses of Parliament (where he made his name writing Sketches by Boz) and down to the foot of Hungerford Bridge and the grey Thames (“stretching away to the great ocean, Death”). This is where the 12-year-old Dickens worked in Warren’s Blacking Factory. You can kindle some Pickwickian cheer in Gordon’s Wine Bar on Villiers Street. It dates from 1890 but is undeniably “Dickensian”. The trains (which brought Dickens’ coffin from Kent) clatter overhead in and out of Charing Cross.Parallel Buckingham Street (where Dickens – and David Copperfield – once lodged) leads to the Strand. Nothing much survives other than its width and bustle, but the Lyceum Theatre (opened 1834) put on an adaptation of A Tale of Two Cities in 1860. And Dickens lived just behind at 16 Wellington Street (now gone) before moving to number 26, where he kept a bachelor flat and produced his magazine, All Year Round.Walk across Covent Garden and past the grand, grubby Garrick Club, which Dickens loved and loathed. In Dickens’ day, Seven Dials, just to the north, was a raddled slum of “dirty men, filthy women, squalid children … reeking pipes … depressed dogs”. Thanking your lucky stars (or the author’s campaigning work), head east along narrow, now-sanitised streets to 58-59 Lincoln’s Inn Fields, the house of Dickens’ friend and biographer, John Forster. In Bleak House, this is the home (and murder scene) of the ghastly lawyer, Mr Tulkinghorn.One of Dickens’ own homes lies to the north, best reached via Chancery Lane (“the one great principle of English law is to make business for itself”) and Gray’s Inn Walks Gardens. Dickens lived at 48 Doughty Street from 1837 to 1839, the period when his fame was at its height. It has been reconstructed as he knew it (sort of): his desk, the dining table set for a feast, and the bedroom where his sister-in-law, Mary, died.Head across Gray’s Inn Road and follow Elm Street and Mount Pleasant (where Smallweed skulked in Bleak House) to cross Rosebery Avenue into Coldbath Square. Then take Crawford Passage into Farringdon Road and the warm embrace of the Betsey Trotwood pub. Betsey was David Copperfield’s aunt – and the pub, while not of Dickens’ era, feels right. Just to the left is Pear Tree Court, where Oliver Twist watched the Artful Dodger picking pockets.Next, dodge back along Clerkenwell Road to go down Hatton Garden (number 54 was Mr Fang’s magistrates court in Oliver Twist), admiring the jewellers, and into Saffron Hill. The streets are dark, narrow and now gentrified: you wouldn’t think that this was once Fagin’s lair, nor that the One Tun pub was, reportedly, Bill Sikes’ local, The Three Cripples.Cross Farringdon Road again, which was in an uproar of new building in the 1860s (it still is) and finish in the tiny Jerusalem Tavern, opened in 1996 but looking ancient. There’s a log fire, it’s cold outside, so raise a glass and say, “God bless us, every one!”Peter Fiennes is the author of Footnotes: A Journey Round Britain in the Company of Great Writers (Oneworld, £16.99), available for £14.95 inc UK p\u0026ampp at the  BookshopLooking for a holiday with a difference?

So why did it fall from grace so swiftly?In the 2010s, there were TV shows and then there was Game of Thrones. HBO’s adaptation of George RR Martin’s epic fantasy series dominated the entire television landscape. Endlessly dissected online and beloved by everyone from former president Barack Obama to Snoop Dogg, it became the subject of countless fan videos and closed out the decade as the most popular show on earth, averaging more than 25 million viewers per episode (an official figure that didn’t even take into account the illegal downloads, which also saw it win the dubious accolade of the globe’s most pirated TV show).It was also the last piece of true event television in an age where our viewing is increasingly splintered by the rise of streaming. While other shows exist to be binged in one greedy gulp, Game of Thrones had to be watched weekly – a fact that only boosted its appeal, making it the show on everyone’s lips every Monday.Most of all, though, it changed the way the world thought about fantasy on the small screen. Prior to Game of Thrones, accepted wisdom said it was impossible to turn fantasy into a TV hit. Post-Game of Thrones, TV executives seem unable to stop commissioning variations on the theme.Westeros DNA can be spied in everything from straightforward historical epics such as The Last Kingdom to the weird, wild world of Sky Atlantic’s Britannia. Netflix’s The Witcher is the latest show to conform to the fantasy juggernaut’s template of gruesome violence and largely gratuitous nudity.It wasn’t always this way. When Game of Thrones began in 2011, the focus was as much on the sharp one-liners and the cunning political machinations as it was on the big twists and even bigger spectacle. But as the show progressed – and crucially, as creators David Benioff and DB Weiss were forced away from Martin’s books due to lack of new material – the show became less character driven and ever more bombastic.Never was this clearer and more devastating than in the season six finale, The Winds of Winter. At the time of airing, the episode – in which Cersei Lannister wiped out Baelor’s Sept and with it much of the cast – was hailed as a triumph, a sure sign that Benioff and Weiss had a thrilling endgame in mind. In reality, it was the moment that fatally weakened the foundations on which the series was built – and provided proof that, when in doubt, the writers would always blow things up first and ask questions later.Having established Cersei as a master villain, Benioff and Weiss appeared to have no idea what to do with her, largely deserting the intrigue in King’s Landing to concentrate on the epic fights. That was understandable given the importance of a final showdown between the Night King’s undead army and the rest of humanity, but the gaping hole where politics used to be ensured that the last two seasons prized showy did-you-see-that? moments – the sudden death of Littlefinger, Daenerys’s fiery destruction of King’s Landing – over carefully nurtured plots and character development. This obsession with style over substance also had a knock-on effect on the shows that came after. Many of those big-budget projects such as Troy, The Bastard Executioner and American Gods were flops, made in the most shallow image of Game of Thrones and ignoring the fact that what originally made the show a hit were its quieter moments. Conversely, the series that have worked – Outlander, Penny Dreadful, the BBC’s recent adaptation of Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials – did so because, like Game of Thrones, they put the story they were telling above flashy special effects. Each also exuded the feeling that this was fantasy adapted by people who adored the source material, not just executives scrabbling around for a hit.Not that the high-profile failures have stopped the commissions coming. Huge adaptations of Lord of the Rings, Robert Jordan’s classic fantasy The Wheel of Time and Patrick Rothfuss’s cult series The Kingkiller Chronicle are in the works.Some may prove to be worth the wait, although it’s hard not to wonder if TV will already have moved on by the time they arrive because perhaps the most interesting thing about Game of Thrones is the way that – despite all its noise and thunder – it faded so swiftly from the collective memory, slipping down the best-of-the-decade lists and increasingly attacked for being not so much the story of Shakespearian grandeur it promised to be but instead, in Macbeth’s words, a tale “full of sound and fury signifying nothing”.At its best, though, Game of Thrones was addictive and unmissable TV, filled with great lines and genuinely surprising and well-earned moments. But history can be cruel to shows once lauded as the best of their era.It is also true that its limitations were built in. Race was badly handled from the beginning, with the Dothraki presented as violent savages and Daenerys’s storyline constantly flirting with white saviour tropes. It also consistently courted controversy over its handling of sex, from the decision to shoot Sansa’s brutal wedding to Ramsay entirely through Theon’s gaze to the mishandling of a scene between incestuous siblings Jaime and Cersei that turned it from reunion to rape.Such issues – coupled with the sense that this was ultimately a show comprised more of bombast than brilliance – means that Game of Thrones’ greatest legacy may turn out not to be the myriad copycat shows it spawned but rather the silly sums of money the makers of those shows willingly spent. Game of Thrones is dead long live Game of Thrones."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e6f5bc51a0999e2f148b66e9bff620431e48486/0_47_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76191f435598d5dc9c161cfa32362f33","title":"james corden hints gavin and stacey could return for a full series","story":"After the festive special becomes most popular Christmas Day TV of the decade, a co-star reveals Corden is keen to make series fourAfter the tidy response to the Gavin and Stacey Christmas special, which saw the return of the beloved BBC sitcom after almost a decade off our screens, its co-creator James Corden has hinted that it may now return for a full fourth series.Oscar Hartland, who stars in the show as Neil “the baby” – the son of Smithy (Corden) and Nessa (co-creator Ruth Jones) – told presenters on Good Morning Britain that he asked Corden whether Gavin and Stacey could make a full series comeback, and Corden replied that it might happen if it’s “what the people want”.Hartland said: “I did ask James in the process of filming. He said it’s just what the people want.” He continued: “Me, I would love it to happen. It really depends what other people think about it and whether they like it or not.”The Christmas special was watched by 11.6 million people, making it the most popular Christmas Day TV show of the decade, and ended on a romantic cliffhanger after Nessa confessed her love to Smithy.Since Gavin and Stacey went off air in 2010, Corden has gained fame in the US, presenting The Late Late Show With James Corden and regularly going viral with the segment Carpool Karaoke. He is currently starring as Bustopher Jones in the movie Cats, which has been widely ridiculed, the ’s Peter Bradshaw describing it as a “purr-fectly dreadful hairball of woe”.

The ÖVP is expected to retain control of the key posts of chancellor and finance minister, while also claiming the interior, foreign and defence ministries.A new ministry for integration looks designated to allow Kurz to continue his hardline policy on immigration. It will be run by his confidante Susanne Raab, who worked on the country’s 2017 ban on full-face veils and a 2015 law designed to curb “political Islam”.The Green party will aim to exercise the most influence through a boosted ministry for infrastructure, transport and environment, expected to be headed by the former climate activist Leonore Gewessler.Green politicians in charge of the justice and culture portfolios will hope to curb the more authoritarian tendencies of Kurz’s ÖVP.

Fioramonti, who in November declared that Italy would be the first country to teach climate change in schools, has hinted at forming a parliamentary group that would include other disgruntled M5S politicians.In what was hailed as a victory against the far right, M5S in September went into coalition with the centre-left Democratic party (PD) after the collapse of its alliance with Matteo Salvini’s League when he brought down the government in a move to force elections. But the past four months have been marred by constant bickering and scant action on policy.In a speech on Saturday, Conte said he was iding the education ministry in two, naming Lucia Azzolina, also from M5S, as minister for schools, and Gaetano Manfredi, a non-party technocrat and rector of Naples University, as minister for universities and research.Conte also took a swipe at Salvini, who stills looms large over Italian politics, calling his behaviour “insidious”. As the he outlined a programme that included reforms of the justice system and state bureaucracy, he added: “Politics doesn’t need conflicts. Polemics and marking out our differences do not help.”The differences between M5S and PD have been laid bare since the government came together and few expect it to last. The alliance has failed to devise any strong policies or respond effectively to industrial crises, and has backtracked on key initiatives, such as a tax on plastic. Even though the budget passed without controversy, the financial strategy contains nothing that will tackle high unemployment or revive Italy’s long-stagnant economy.“This government is going nowhere,” said Wolfango Piccoli, the co-president of the London-based research company Teneo Holdings. “It is spending most of its time arguing and not much gets done at all. This is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future.”The close-knit alliance is campaigning vigorously ahead of the next crucial test in Emilia-Romagna on 26 January. The region has been leftwing since the end of the second world war and is currently led by the PD. At the same time support for the PD and M5S is waning.“The next key issue will be the elections in Emilia-Romagna and if the PD loses there, I think it would be difficult for them to stick with this coalition,” said Piccoli.There is a glimmer of hope: Stefano Bonaccini, the incumbent president of the region seeking a new mandate, has been polling slightly ahead of the League candidate, Lucia Borgonzoni.The Sardines, a protest movement that emerged in November in reaction to Salvini’s threat to “liberate” Emilia-Romagna from the left, might also hold some sway.Franco Pavoncello, a political science professor and president of John Cabot University in Rome, said if the PD was successful in Emilia-Romagna then the coalition could try to maintain the partnership for a little longer, especially with both parties knowing they would be crushed in general elections if held in the near future. However, the biggest challenge for Nicola Zingaretti, who leads the PD, and Luigi Di Maio, the leader of M5S, will be keeping their parties intact. A week after the government was sworn in, dozens of PD parliamentarians joined Italia Viva, the group established by the former prime minister Matteo Renzi and more M5S politicians are poised to leave."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16296f422f6f259aaae84f9feacb9bc88c10ebc3/0_225_4758_2856/master/4758.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3331e199ac2892d8be2d7f7cd943010f","title":"latin america tumultuous year 2019","story":"2020 could bring another year of turmoil for Latin America after the dramatic events of 2019 from the Caribbean to Chile Celso Amorim joined Brazil’s foreign service nearly six decades ago and rose all the way to its top but even he struggles to recall a Latin American year like 2019.“Like this? Never before,” Brazil’s former foreign minister said of the tumultuous 12 months that have seen social and political upheaval rattle the region, from Buenos Aires to Bogotá.The final year of the decade was only 23 days old when the turmoil began with an explosion of dissent on the streets of Venezuela that most observers felt sure would displace its authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro.Mass protests, frantic predictions of Maduro’s imminent downfall, and a botched military uprising followed before Juan Guaidó’s campaign to topple Hugo Chávez’s heir fizzled and an uneasy calm returned.But elsewhere the action was only just beginning, as a wave of protests and violence swept Puerto Rico, Haiti, Ecuador and Bolivia – where President Evo Morales was forced from office amid a bloody military crackdown – leaving some wondering if a Latin American Spring had arrived.In Peru the president dissolved congress in Argentina Cristina Fernández de Kirchner staged a dramatic political comeback and in Colombia hundreds of thousands flooded the streets in opposition to the rightwing president, Iván Duque.Even Chile, supposedly a haven of Latin American stability and affluence, was sucked into the mayhem as a hike in subway fares triggered its worst unrest in decades, leaving a trail of destruction and President Sebastián Piñera’s future in doubt.“Where did that come from?” Ivan Briscoe, the International Crisis Group’s Latin America chief, wondered as he considered that country’s unexpected cameo in the chaos.As a new year of uncertainty approached, Briscoe said he sensed “an acceleration of time” in the region.“Things which have been building up for years and years – whether it’s the social stratification of Chile Evo Morales’s moves towards eternal power in Bolivia the deeply hostile standoff in Venezuela – now seem to be breaking the surface in so many different contexts and leading to a situation where we fundamentally don’t know what is going to happen.“I can tell you where I think the fault lines are going to be for next year,” he added. “But I can’t say exactly what is going to materialize.”Some on Latin America’s left have sought comfort in the confusion.Amorim, 77, painted the upheaval as a popular “counter-reaction” to the “onslaught of neoliberalism” besieging countries from Colombia to Chile.“It is very difficult to say where we’re going,” he said. “But one thing is different: eight months ago, the appearance was that everything was going rightwing – totally rightwing. And now it’s not so clear. So that – in spite of all the problems – is some kind of progress.As the year draws to a close, minds are turning to what comes next.In a new report the Economist Intelligence Unit warned of a high risk of “protest contagion”, noting how Colombia’s protests were inspired by rebellions in neighbouring countries.“There is a strong chance that 2020 will be another volatile year for Latin America,” the report said, predicting particularly choppy waters in Lenín Moreno’s Ecuador.Briscoe saw three likely 2020 flash points: Venezuela, as it fell deeper into political and humanitarian ruin Brazil and Argentina, as a diplomatic spat intensified between their ideologically opposed leaders and Mexico, where President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is struggling to control a historic murder crisis claiming almost 100 lives a day.Mass demonstrations rocked Mexico in 2014 after the disappearance of 43 students shocked the nation and Briscoe said a repeat was possible if the killing did not slow.Briscoe also foresaw strife in Bolivia if the ultra-conservative activist Luis Fernando Camacho reached the second-round of fresh presidential elections and faced a candidate from Evo Morales’s leftist Movement Towards Socialism.“I’d say we will be facing a very tricky period … In Colombia, in Chile, but also Brazil, Mexico and Argentina there is potential for things to go very wrong indeed.“We are sitting on a minefield of social discontent,” Briscoe added, identifying Honduras, Nicaragua, Bolivia and Chile as other potential “danger spots”.Observers are split on whether Latin America’s biggest economy runs the risk of unrest, with former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva recently urging followers to “follow Chile’s example” and rebel against the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro.Some argue Bolsonaro’s shock 2018 election has helped channel anti-establishment rage away from the streets, for now. But Monica de Bolle, a Latin America expert from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said Brazil could easily be next.“The moment right now – as of this very second – is not one where people are going to go out in the streets and demonstrate. But things are not static – things are dynamic,” she said.“That may lead to something like we’ve seen in Brazil in the past few years and it could even be a 2013-type scenario,” she said, referring to the mass demonstrations that paved the way for Dilma Rousseff’s impeachment three years later.Amorim also predicted his country could face tumult as public anger at Bolsonaro’s failings grew.But perhaps not quite yet.“Everything here in Brazil is slow,” Amorim admitted. “Except samba.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64141b30614f59d097d77e4f9212ac04b33d2711/1675_1130_2421_1453/master/2421.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0944ac3fec54d54c0320f4e42ba943cf","title":"swedish boys ashes recovered after alleged thiefs tearful apology","story":" Mother says man called to say he accidentally stole urn and gave directions for its retrievalCypriot police have recovered the ashes of a Swedish teenager after a man who said he accidentally stole the urn telephoned the family in Sweden, offering a tearful apology, and gave directions for its retrieval, the youth’s mother has said.Kinga Bednarz, whose son died in an accident several months ago, told the Associated Press she was “relieved and thankful” after the ordeal, saying her conversation with the alleged thief was an “emotional moment”.She said the man, who did not identify himself, insisted he had meant no harm to her or her family.The urn, inscribed with “Dennis 2000-2019”, was in one of three bags stolen last week from a rental car the family was using while on vacation on the east Mediterranean island. The bags were taken after thieves smashed the passenger side window.It is unclear whether the thief’s remorse extended to him returning about €200 (£170) in cash that the bags also contained.Bednarz, who is originally from Poland but has lived in Sweden for 13 years, said the man told her where the urn could be found. She notified police in Cyprus who tracked it down near a highway exit on the island’s southern coast.The family had parked at Governor’s Beach intending to scatter the ashes into the sea. Bednarz, who flew back to Sweden on Saturday, said she and her husband would return to Cyprus on Tuesday to collect the urn. The theft came to light after Bednarz asked local media to issue an appeal for information. Police have arrested three Cypriot nationals in connection with the theft: two men aged 33 and 43, and a 34-year-old woman. Police said they received a tipoff implicating the woman and the 33-year-old man, while the other man was suspected of helping them evade arrest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c356e19dec8ff6c20a8763e0abc5bffa9b13fe38/0_240_3595_2157/master/3595.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5a25965266be53cc2de7b5cb07fab3f","title":"taiwan presidential election referendum on ties with china","story":"Contest is in effect a referendum on the future of the self-governed island’s relationship with ChinaCitizen groups in Taiwan are fighting a Russian-style influence and misinformation campaign that is believed to originate across the strait in mainland China with just weeks to go before it votes for its next president,Taiwan goes to the polls on 11 January to decide between two main candidates, incumbent president Tsai Ing-Wen of the Democratic Progressive party (DPP) under whom ties with Beijing have become fraught, and Han Kuo-Yu of the Kuomintang party (KMT), which advocates closer engagement with China.The contest is in large part a referendum on the future of Taiwan’s relationship with Beijing, which sees the self-governed island as a renegade province that one day must return to the fold. Han is Beijing’s favoured candidate while Tsai’s party has been campaigning on the slogan: “Resist China, Defend Taiwan”. In a televised debate with her rivals for the job on Sunday, Tsai said China’s “expanding ambitions” were the biggest threat to its democracy.Citizen groups in Taiwan say the openness of one of the freest societies in Asia is being used against it by groups in China to wage an online disinformation campaign, made more potent by their shared language, Mandarin. A recent study by the V-Dem Institute at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden found that Taiwan was the most exposed to foreign dissemination of false information.False reports include claims Tsai’s doctorate degree was fake or that Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong kicked an elderly man when he visited Taiwan in October and met members of the DPP.“China has multiple ways of pushing misinformation. We’ve found that content mills are no longer simply producing fake information. More and more, they are manipulating opinions,” said Jarvis Chiu, senior manager for the Institute for Information Industry, which has been assisting government efforts to prevent disinformation.According to Chiu, an army of trolls will leave thousands of comments under a candidate’s post or a news article, shifting the focus of the debate. Fake social media accounts also share pro-Beijing content or inflate the number of likes such content gets. “Subliminal attacks” include repeatedly searching for one candidate’s name to influence search algorithm results.“China won’t give up this practice. It will only increase and because it is non-military, it won’t get much global attention,” Chiu said.The uncertain status of Taiwan, functionally independent but not internationally recognised, has been an issue in every campaign since direct elections were introduced in the 1990s following decades of martial law under the KMT. This year, the question of how Taiwan should deal with Beijing looms even larger after years of increasingly strident rhetoric from China. On Thursday, China sailed its new aircraft carrier, Shandong, through the Taiwan Strait in a move critics described an effort to intimidate voters. Months of witnessing Beijing’s inflexible response to protesters in Hong Kong have cast even more doubt on the city’s “one country, two systems” framework, once touted as a possible model for Taiwan.“There’s a sword hanging over everyone all the time,” said Shelley Rigger, a professor of east Asian politics with a focus on Taiwan at Davidson College. “It’s exhausting to know that you’re being threatened and that the entity that is threatening you is getting more and more powerful all the time.”In an attempt to push back against the campaign, citizen watchdog groups are manning social media, debunking rumours and trying to trace questionable content back to its source. Prosecutors have been charging those who spread disinformation. The party in office is trying to pass a law that would prohibit support from foreign “infiltration sources” to a political party.“Taiwanese people have only just started understanding what is happening. It’s still the very beginning,” said Summer Chen, of Taiwan FactCheck Center which works on debunking disinformation on Facebook. “It is a crisis and all of Taiwan needs to be researching this.”A series of snappy Youtube tutorials educate viewers on the nature and methods of disinformation warfare. “Taiwan has become the main laboratory for information warfare from China. If China wants to practice its methods, Taiwan is the starting point,” Puma Shen, who runs DoubleThink Labs, which monitors how false information, explains in one of the videos.Those working on the issue say it is difficult to definitely say these attacks originated in China or link them to Chinese state actors, which makes the work of raising awareness harder.“I believe that there is cooperation with China, but how much China knows, how much of this is from the Chinese government or people in Taiwan who are pro-China, we don’t know,” said Vivian Chen, a recent graduate studying medicine from Taipei.China’s efforts to influence events in Taiwan stretch a long way back and go beyond online information warfare, to include traditional media, incentives for citizens or businesses who cooperate with China, group trips and donations to temples and other grassroots organisations.Last month when Chinese defector Wang Liqiang detailed ways he had been instructed to interfere in Taiwan’s midterm elections in 2018 as well as the upcoming race, few in Taiwan were surprised.“The story was not as shocking in Taiwan as it was in other parts of the world,” said Lev Nachman, a PhD candidate at the University of California, Irvine, studying social movements and focusing on Taiwan. “It is not news to Taiwanese people that China has been co-opting local organisations for political influence.”Observers say it is unlikelyefforts to influence voters will affect the outcome of the race, where voters will also choose representatives for the legislature. According to polls, Tsai is ahead of her rival, helped by months of protests in Hong Kong and concerns about Beijing, and an improved economy.• This article was amended on 30 December 2019.

One that went on to inspire fashion, soundtrack films, appear on the most Spotify playlists and dominate main stages at the UK’s biggest music festivals.Unapologetically depicting the reality of street culture in London, grime spoke the language of black, working-class life and reeled listeners in with attention-grabbing writing that could gracefully switch between cutting humour and tender vulnerability, and a 140bpm tempo that feels unstoppable. A sister genre to UK garage, grime’s roots derive from hip-hop and jungle with elements of dancehall and house. But by the late noughties and early 2010s, grime’s initial wave of success – driven by the likes of Dizzee Rascal, Lethal B, Kano and others – had quietened.Many factors were at play, notably the politan police’s form 696 – an assessment form that required London’s clubs to describe both the genre of music they wanted to play and the ethnicity of their target audience. It was first issued in 2005 and not scrapped until 2017, amid long-standing accusations of racial bias. The decline wasn’t terminal as quickly as grime retreated, it returned – with a vengeance.This decade, grime has re-emerged as a force that can’t be ignored. In 2012, Radio 1Xtra’s Fire in the Booth became the place for artists to showcase their freestyle talents, building on the successes of the previous decade’s indie platforms such as Channel U, Lord of the Mics, SB.TV, GRM Daily, Link Up TV and Risky Roadz.2014 was the year things really kicked into overdrive. Meridian Dan’s German Whip and Skepta’s That’s Not Me powered into mainstream consciousness, while an unsigned Stormzy earned one of the most coveted slots for early-career artists – a performance on the Jools Holland show. In the same year, the Mobos created a standalone grime award category, signifying its importance and uniqueness, while east London MC Ghetts declared grime the new punk.But grime didn’t succeed on the strength of the music alone. It was around this time that global cultural shifts saw a change in whose stories were valued, who was allowed to speak, and who was going to be listened to, all aided by social media. The time was right for a sound like this to take root.Soon after, international music heavyweights such as Drake and Kanye West made inroads into the culture, the latter providing one of the most talked-about performances at the Brits when he brought on stage an entourage of some of grime’s finest, from Jammer to Novelist, during his performance of All Day in 2015.Political interventions from grime artists became headline news, whether it was Stormzy’s 2019 Glastonbury set, climaxing with thousands chanting “Fuck Boris”, or 2017’s Grime 4 Corbyn movement – part of a general election campaign that achieved the highest turnout among 18-24-year-olds for a quarter of a century. And with the release of Skepta’s 2016 Konnichiwa and Stormzy’s 2017 Gang Signs \u0026amp Prayer, both the old guard, and a new generation of talent, took the wider public by storm.It’s not just the big commercial artists that are continuing to push the genre forward into mainstream it’s the smaller underground acts too. Producers like Maxsta and Drone and MCs like Melvillous, Jammz and Yizzy are fine lieutenants in grime’s second coming.Grime has also become a more erse space this decade, with numerous female MCs rising to prominence out of the genre’s male-dominated origins, including Nolay, Lady Leshurr, AG, Female Takeover, Lioness and Madam X. And when Lady Leshurr came out as pansexual in 2018, grime found its first LGBTQ+ superstar, while underground MCs like Karnage Kills prove there’s an exciting pipeline of queer grime talent ready for the world to notice. As grime grew in stature, its influence spread beyond the M25, and the 2010s saw artists from around the country, such as Manchester’s Bugzy Malone, match London’s finest for passion, skillset and flow.Music streaming platforms such as Spotify have played their part in the genre’s growth too, sending new fans on journeys of discovery. Spotify’s own playlists Grime Shutdown and Grime Classics have more than 850,000 followers between them. And its playlists created by fans and brands also attract big numbers. Red Bull’s Grime + UK Rap 2019 playlist is one of the most popular, bringing the best of the year’s output to thousands of fans.Grime arrived at a time when black British culture needed a vocal means of expression that it could call its own, and survived the changing tides of music consumption. In this decade it has infiltrated every facet of British life – who’d have thought, 20 years ago, that you’d hear a legend like D Double E on a Christmas ad, or grime playing in the EastEnders cafe? In much the same way as hip-hop changed US pop culture decades before, grime is changing UK pop culture – and it is a shift that’s likely to be just as irreversible.To celebrate the end of the decade, Spotify is unlocking 10 years of your streaming data.

The UN, for the first time, formally condemned discrimination based on sexuality. Countries across the world, from Greenland to Bermuda, legalised same-sex marriage. And in May this year, the World Health Organization reframed “gender identity disorders” as “gender incongruence”, sending a clear message that being trans is not an illness that needs curing.Alongside these legal and social changes, LGBTQ+ entertainers have gained a foothold in the mainstream. In truth, they were always there: Dusty Springfield, Sylvester and George Michael, just to name a few – and that’s not to mention the countless LGBTQ+ songwriters and producers who have worked behind the scenes. But in the 2010s, greater acceptance and legal protections have made it possible for LGBTQ+ artists to come out earlier in their careers, tell explicitly queer stories in their music, receive respect from the press, present authentically, and speak directly to their communities.So before we step forward into 2020, let’s look back at some of the defining artists, moments and movements that have soundtracked a decade of change.Out at the Oscars: Sam SmithAn out-and-proud queer person, Sam Smith has not just written, but performed a Bond theme song (Writing’s on the Wall) – and then gone on to win an Academy Award for it. With millions of streams, three Brit awards, and a Golden Globe too, Smith is arguably the biggest UK queer star of the decade (in any industry) – their voice can be heard on wedding playlists, playing in the background of reality shows, and on TV ads. And Smith has also sparked headline-grabbing dialogue about LGBTQ+ issues, particularly with their recent revelation that they identify as non-binary – showing how LGBTQ+ artists have become shining lights in even mainstream entertainment.Listen to some of Sam Smith’s favourite tracks on their Out Now Spotify playlist.The French connection: Christine and the QueensAnother beacon of mainstream queer success is French pansexual artist Chris, of Christine and the Queens. An artist with a mission to challenge expectations, her masculine aesthetic is a deliberate, daring “playing around with the male gaze”. Her refusal to submit to the binary has left her misunderstood in France, by her own admission, but in the UK she has been welcomed with open arms. In 2019, her Glastonbury set – praised by critics and adored by the crowd – was soaked in the cheeky, energetic masculinity that she has become known for. Perhaps Chris’s mainstream success in the UK is indicative of audiences wanting a departure from conformity – something challenging, brave and confident, far removed from the entertaining but soapy pop that dominated much of the early noughties.Listen to Christine and the Queens and other queer alternative artists on Spotify’s Alternative Pride playlist.Made in the USA: transatlantic queer popThe US too has seen more LGBTQ+ artists welcomed into the mainstream in the 2010s. And, thanks to streaming and social media, they’re accessible to the UK, and everywhere else. Earlier this year, Lil Nas X became the first out black gay artist to score a US No 1, with Old Town Road, which then went on to become the longest-running No 1 in US history, in large part due to his streaming success. With success came his admission that he used to “pray and pray” that being gay was just a phase – a sobering reminder that, even in an era of heightened acceptance, there’s a long way to go.He’s perhaps the most viral LGBTQ+ artist in the US currently, but he’s by no means the only one. Janelle Monáe and Frank Ocean, two artists respected for their creativity and storytelling, are fierce queer advocates. Then there’s RuPaul and his army of Drag Race alumni, for whom infectious music is just one weapon in their culture-bridging entertainment arsenal. The RuPaul effect has been felt keenly in the UK this year, with Break Up (Bye Bye), the viral single from the show’s inaugural UK season, clocking up more than a million streams on Spotify.Listen to RuPaul and queens from Drag Race UK and US on Spotify’s Fierce playlist.Small but fierce: the innovative sound of independent queer musicIn a world defined by social media and streaming, you don’t have to be signed to a major label to be acclaimed this decade, independent queer artists in the UK have been able to reach fans and build their own communities. A variety of acts – from dream-pop artist Leo Kalyan, to acerbic electro princess Girli, to the critically acclaimed Rina Sawayama – are challenging the pop star template and creating representations for LGBTQ+ fans who have historically not seen themselves reflected in art and culture. And in the process, they are inspiring queer people of all walks of life to stand tall.Listen to Leo Kalyan on Spotify’s Work it, Own it playlist.All this activity in the 2010s is a glorious indication of things to come and a testament to the resilience and creativity of LGBTQ+ artists. With the advent of online streaming, listeners are empowered to find music they can connect with. Progress is not guaranteed, but with music consumption as it now is, it feels unlikely that we could ever go back to a period where LGBTQ+ people can’t listen to music from people who are like them, on demand. Which is exactly as it should be.To celebrate the end of the decade, Spotify is unlocking 10 years of your streaming data.

It’s the enemy of progress. After all, how can you move forward with your life if all you’re doing is looking back, living in the past and uttering melancholic sighs of: “Ah, those were the days” as your eyes slowly glaze over? What about these days you’re living right now, and the days after those, and the days after those?That’s the received wisdom, anyway. But where did it come from? Back in the 17th and 18th centuries, nostalgia was viewed as a medical disease that manifested itself through irregular heartbeats and full-on bouts of weeping among other maladies, and it was attributed to demons – demons! – attacking the middle brain. That might have something to do with it.Today, while we associate nostalgia with warm, fuzzy feelings related to our childhoods, or other times in our past that were especially happy, it still carries negative connotations in our live-in-the-moment culture. But, we may be looking at this all wrong. At least, that’s what Tim Wildschut, professor of social and personality psychology at the University of Southampton, believes.“People in a nostalgic mood are more optimistic about their future, and are more inspired to pursue their most important goals,” says Wildschut. “Rather than freezing them in place, nostalgia is very motivational – the past provides a template for what you’d like your future to look like. Maybe you went fishing with your dad, or cycling with your mum. You may develop the goal of having a family yourself and doing those things with your own children.”Of course, there are many things that can trigger nostalgia. Smells, tastes, photographs, you name it, you’ve probably experienced it. But perhaps one of the most potent is music. “Music is a very strong trigger of nostalgia,” says Wildschut. “We often use it in our studies to induce nostalgia it’s very effective, very efficient. But it’s important that it’s a personal thing. You really have to look at a person’s inidual experiences. It might be a completely obscure Spanish song that they listened to when they were in Spain with friends. To them it’s very nostalgic, but to anyone else it doesn’t mean anything.”It makes sense then, that the songs we listen to can be markers of significant events in our lives, able to transport us back with all the speed and efficiency of a flux capacitor-equipped DeLorean. For those of us who stream music, the Spotify Wrapped feature is an opportunity, at the end of each year, to relive those moments triggered by certain songs. And with this year marking a decade of Wrapped, that’s potentially 10 years of memories waiting to be rediscovered.As it turns out, hearing certain music picks me up and deposits me right into London in 2010. This music wasn’t topping charts, or indicative of the era to many, but it remains powerful to me because it represents a time in my life when I felt a real sense of community and belonging – perhaps the first time since I’d left college to go to university.Looking back, London in 2010 was an exhilarating place to be if you loved bass, beat and hip-hop music, which I did. It had been a couple of years since Flying Lotus (AKA Steven Ellison) dropped his breakthrough album Los Angeles on Warp Records, and the LA beat scene was expanding at a rapid pace – thanks in part to Lotus’ own Brainfeeder label, the Alpha Pup Records, and the exposure provided courtesy of British-based DJs Mary Anne Hobbs, Benji B and Gilles Peterson. And in Britain itself, producers such as Hudson Mohawke and Rustie – both hailing from Glasgow – were pushing their own hyperkinetic style of beat music to equally hyper audiences.At the time, I was editing a music blog I’d created with friends, and we were fully invested in the beat scene – partying at the Brainfeeder takeover of Fabric, getting sweaty and dancing until the early hours in east London warehouse spaces to a soundtrack of beats and basslines both wigged-out and dreamy. (Yes, I have tinnitus.) Everywhere we went, there were people we knew and enjoyed connecting with. It was like Cheers, but in clubs.I live in Cornwall now, married with two kids – but play me Double Fifths by Teebs, or Coat of Arms by Nosaj Thing, and that powerful sense of community I had nearly 10 years ago rushes right back. And while I haven’t yet found that same feeling of belonging in the south-west that I had back in London, like Wildschut says, the nostalgia I feel when I listen to these tracks doesn’t make me feel anxious, or even sad. Instead, I feel encouraged to seek out that local community – whether it’s based on music or not – with more vigour, and more verve, because, well, I want that feeling again. Ah, those were the days.To celebrate the end of the decade, Spotify is unlocking 10 years of your streaming data.

Photograph: Damien EagersThousands of Dublin households, currently exempt from having wheelie bins at their homes, may have to accept brown bins under new waste management rules.Minister for Climate Action and Environment Richard Bruton wants to make the use of brown bins for compostable waste compulsory for all households within the next two years.However, Dubliners living on almost 1,000 streets in the capital currently have an exemption from the use of wheelie bins. Rules requiring the use of wheelie bins instead of refuse sacks came into force in July 2016, but following objections from householders mostly living in terraced housing with no front gardens and no direct access to the back of their homes, more than 900 streets were exempt from the rules.The exemption covers most homes in Stoneybatter, the Liberties and hundreds of Streets across Dublin 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7, which continue to leave refuse sacks outside their doors.However, Mr Bruton said “we need to find a way” of introducing brown bins to all households. “We recognise there are going to be difficulties in implementation and we need to work with the people, but I think that the contemplation of difficulty has stopped us doing this in the past,” he said “We have to get over those difficulties and not just say there are difficulties and we won’t address them.”Adequate time was being given to ensure any difficulties with the introduction of the brown bin could be ironed out he said.“We are giving people and opportunity to consult and any changes will come over time. It will be two years before we have implemented the full brown bin in its entirety. “We will work with both residents and local authorities to make this effective, but the truth is that half of organic material is either ending up in your black bin or in your green bin that is very bad use of a material and it is contaminating streams which we seek to recycle or reuse.”Other planned measures include levies on non-recyclable plastics such as food packaging in supermarkets, a levy on tobacco companies to cover the cost of cleaning up cigarette butts, and a crackdown on “fast fashion” to stop clothes ending up in the bin.“We are trying to deal with a problem where there is a profligate use of resources with a throwaway culture around certain fashion items. They may be cheap as well but that cheapness comes at a price.”Mr Bruton rejected the suggestion that penalising cheap clothes could hurt low income families. “In terms of fashion it is not good economics for any household to be throwing out materials so quickly, and a lot of the fast fashion isn’t aimed at just trying to make low incomes stretch, this is a very well planned and executed strategy by companies to sell more fashion,” he said.“This is not really about having hard wearing clothes for people on low incomes that they can get a good life out of.”Mr Bruton was announcing Government proposals intended to improve Ireland’s management of waste."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Charlie Flanagan meets families and says their stories are \u0026lsquoharrowing and deeply moving\u0026rsquoFacebook message from Tullamore parish described as \u0026lsquoextremely hurtful\u0026rsquo by Simon HarrisWater safety group warns of the over-reliance on mobile phones when at seaMinister for Climate Action and Environment Richard Bruton wants brown bins in all homesAirport was \u0026lsquochaotic\u0026rsquo on day flight was missed due to Storm Ali, Workplace Relations Commission heardPitches at Kilbogget Park are now unusable after a car is repeatedly driven across themRecord temperatures for time of year recorded in Scotland and Moscow as Dublin hits 14 degreesUnion says frustration at overcrowding is part of the reason for abuse towards staffJoe McHugh to develop new blueprint to support Irish-medium educationGovernment will not stand by bad practices seen in FAI - Minister of HealthFactors leading to fatal helicopter crash off Mayo coast in 2017 still exist \u0026ndash IALPAFrankie Dunne (64) described as \u0026lsquoharmless and inoffensive man who never hurt anyone\u0026rsquoLetter apparently written to a sister is found in an old history book about WinchesterSwedish teenager\u0026rsquos parents say they made changes to save their daughter, not climateOutdoor concerts, silent discos and best of New Year\u0026rsquos Eve TV to help you ring in 2020Garda\u0026iacute appeal for witnesses and motorists who were in area with dash cam footageMoney earmarked a year ago to provide facilities in the city centre remains unusedPreserving the integrity of the single market remains EU trade commissioner\u0026rsquos top priorityEU commissioner believes British PM will abandon promise not to extend"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4127312.1577718534!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new year s eve events guide where to go and what to do","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConcert goers will also be able to enjoy the “solar symphony” display mapped on to Custom House QuayA number of events are taking place across the country this Tuesday night to ring in the New Year.Tickets for the countdown concert at Custom House Quay in Dublin are still available for €36.90 with performances from Walking on Cars, Ash, Aimee and Lisa McHugh.

The bomb was thought to have been the work of the dissident republican terrorist group the Real IRA. Photograph: AP PhotoPeter MorrisonAn IRA bomb that exploded on the tracks of the Dublin to Belfast railway could have had “disastrous” consequences if a different train had been in service at the time, newly-declassified files disclose.Diplomatic cables released under the 30-year-rule show casualties were avoided when the explosive went off at Lurgan on July 31st, 1989, as a Northern Ireland Railways (NIR) train was delayed at another station.In the cables, Irish diplomats in Belfast reported back to Dublin that the “British side” told them an anonymous 30-minute telephone warning was made to the Samaritans at 10.10pm that night.A search operation was launched and the bomb was located on the southbound track at Lurgan station at 10.38pm. The line was cleared before the bomb exploded at 10.57pm.“The train would have been due in Lurgan at 10.10pm, the precise time at which the warning was received.“But even if there had been a few minutes in hand, it could not have been possible, because of the absence of radio contact with CIÉ trains, to relay a warning to the train and stop it. The bomb had been placed directly on the track and the train itself would have detonated it.”The lack of communications with Irish Rail trains had been raised at the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference at Maryfield in Belfast in April that year.NIR trains had a dual UHF and VHF radio system, allowing control in Belfast to contact them “anywhere” on the line.“The potentially disastrous situation that could have arisen last evening adds considerable urgency to solving this problem and the British side have asked us here about progress in the matter,” a diplomat reported. “Given the frequency with which bombs are now being placed on the line, the issue is obviously one which merits immediate action on the part of CIÉ.”In a separate cable, dated March 2nd, 1989, and marked confidential, an Irish diplomat reported to Dublin that a bomb placed on the third archway of Craigmore Viaduct, between Newry and Bessbrook, had created a 10-metre crater, destroying at least one line.There had been no warning given and the bomb had exploded a mere four minutes before a passenger train was due to pass the point. The passenger train could have “plunged off the viaduct”, it notes.Also in March that year, then minister for foreign affairs Brian Lenihan made a statement condemning the IRA campaign against the railway, noting it had shut down the line for 40 days over a three-month period.The bombing campaign prompted the US to issue an advisory warning to its citizens about the railway being targeted.Cables in August that year show Dublin and London were annoyed about the advisory, and appealed to the US not to publicise it. An Irish diplomat in Washington reported back that the US “recognises the validity of the minister’s concerns, however, they believe an announcement to travellers is necessary and in this context refer to the Pan Am 103 incident” at Lockerbie.“The US have taken into account the concerns about affording a propaganda victory to terrorists,” the diplomat adds.In April 1989, diplomat Declan O’Donovan reported to Dublin that John Fee of the SDLP told him the speculation was that the railway bombing campaign was connected to road haulage.“It is not thought hauliers are paying the IRA to close the line but rather that the IRA itself, or a section of it, is determined to get control of the increasing NorthSouth haulage business before 1992,” O’Donovan reported. “By control, Fee meant direct or indirect commercial control of some companies as well as the extortion or protection money from others.”Three days later, O’Donovan reported that he spoke with the SDLP MP Seamus Mallon who was “strongly sceptical” about the theory, arguing that the main suppliers using the railway – Irish Cement and Guinness – would not be vulnerable to IRA influence and would transport by sea if necessary.The railway bombing campaign is “symbolic” and about showing the IRA’s ability to operate effectively despite observation towers and increased military presence in the area, Mallon believed.Highlights from the government archives and records from 30 years ago."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/18/TELEMMGLPICT000213213788_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqKkzUGe8q7_A35DWV6BPUcYCeVS7pgEPwpvy85C08PWY.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"summer holiday cyprus turned nightmare british teenager gang","story":"Clubbers in a bar in Ayia NapaIt was intended to be a sun-soaked working holiday, a rite of passage between finishing school and starting university.

Betelgeuse is only 700 light years away, and so its explosion into a supernova would be clearly visible from Earth, giving astronomers a chance to watch one of the universe\u0027s most intense and spectacular events from relatively nearby.But while the dimming is clear – it has dropped by a factor of two, enough to be seen with the naked the eye –\u0026nbspthere is nothing to say for sure that it could be a sign that it is about to go supernova. And even if it does, there is no indication that will happen any time soon.Nasa to send robot to Mars to examine possible alien fossilsThere are also a variety of other explanations for the dimming. The star is already seen as semi-variable, pulsating as a variety of vast processes happen around it, and the latest changes could be a more dramatic version of the same natural changes.Betelgeuse is famous in part because it is so bright. It is the biggest of any star we can see apart from our own sun, and is\u0026nbsptraditionally one of the 10 brightest stars in the sky.But its recent unusual behaviour have led it to drop out of that chart. It has become so dim that it has lost its place even in the top 20, astronomers say.The change has meant that the night sky could look unusual even to a casual observer, using the naked eye. Betelgeuse makes up an important part of Orion – sitting on its shoulder – and that has changed as the star has become less easy to see from Earth.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Only Canada comes close to the UK, with a threefold increase in average property prices.\u0026nbspHouse prices in the UK have also risen substantially faster than incomes. Average house prices are now almost twice as high relative to a measure of average household disposable income as they were 40 years ago.Andrew Bailey faces a host of challenges as next Bank of England chiefChronic undersupply of housing in the UK has frequently been blamed for pushing up prices but David Miles and Victoria Monro at the Bank of England found this has not been a significant driver.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The researchers compared house prices, which have risen sharply, with rents, which have remained relatively stable compared to incomes.They concluded that if the main cause of rising prices was lack of properties then rents would also have increased sharply – but this has not happened.According to the bank, UK homeowners currently have a record £1.6 trillion of outstanding home loans.The latest research suggests the\u0026nbspproperty market\u0026nbspwould be vulnerable to sustained interest rate increases – despite the stress tests that loan applicants take to estimate whether they could afford rising monthly mortgage payments in the event that interest rates go up.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Mr Musk said the tunnel will “hopefully be fully operational in 2020”, and would be the first of many tunnel networks beneath cities in the future.“The objective reality for large cities worldwide is that efforts to solve traffic have not worked well,” he tweeted on Sunday. “If we don’t try *something* new, we will be in traffic hell forever.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBy drastically reducing the cost and time it takes to bore tunnels, the firm claims to offer\u0026nbspa radical new option that does not interfere with existing transport infrastructure. Cars and passenger pods would be pinged along electric skates through tunnels at speeds of up to\u0026nbsp155mph, before lifts return them to the surface.“The key to making this work is increasing tunnelling speed and dropping costs by a factor of 10 or more – this is the goal of The Boring Company,” the company’s website states.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

This is not in place of other solutions, eg light rail, but supplemental to them.”A spokesperson for The Boring Company was not immediately available for comment but the Las Vegas and Visitors Authority told CNN that the tunnel would be ready in time for the 2021 Consumer Electronics Show, which takes place in January.“We just broke ground mid-November and have its anticipated completion for the\u0026nbspCES\u0026nbsp2021 show,” a spokesperson said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes. The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared.

(EC)British fans are pointing out that, if Obama has seen the second season of Phoebe Waller Bridge’s series, it stands to reason he will have seen the first, which features a saucy joke about the former US president.\u0026nbspIn the very first episode of the comedy show, the\u0026nbspcharacter of Fleabag (Waller Bridge) is shown being caught\u0026nbspmasturbating to\u0026nbspa video of Obama giving a speech by her boyfriend.Twitter users reacted accordingly, with one writing: “Okay, I’m gonna try to be calm about this, but doesn’t the Fleabag pilot have a scene where she MASTURBATES TO AN OBAMA SPEECH.”Fleabag,\u0026nbspwhich won six Emmys in total, has been nominated for three Golden Globes.

It\u0027s not as glamorous as it sounds,” she said. “If anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don\u0027t. Or maybe real money is a bit softer, but the fake money is like paper, and when I got up off the bed, I turned around to get my robe and everyone gasped. I said, \u0027What is it?\u0027 And they said, \u0027You look like you\u0027ve been whipped a million times. Your back is covered in a thousand red scratches.”During the filming of the sequel to Steven Spielberg’s Jaws, cast members were terrified when real hammerhead sharks started circling them in the sea. The trouble was that their screams went unheard. The crew didn’t think they were in real danger to start with because it was written into the script that they yelled for help at that point.330 Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren – Rocky IVThe fourth in the Rocky film franchise to focus on the boxing career of the fictional Rocky Balboa, played by Sylvester Stallone, has some gripping and authentic-looking fight scenes. It’s no wonder then that during filming, Stallone actually asked Dolph Lundgren, who plays his opponent, Ivan Drago, to try to knock him out for real. But Lundgren hit him with such force that he was sent to the hospital and was in intensive care for over a week.Brando was infamous for his bad on-set behaviour. That is one reason why Paramount was nervous about getting him involved in Francis Ford Coppola’s mafia film. It didn’t start well, when on the first day of shooting, the actor who played the patriarch in the family, Vito Corleone, missed his overnight flight from LA to New York. His scene was rescheduled for the next day, but it cost producers $40,000.In his autobiography, rapper Gucci Mane said he was so tired on set of Harmony Korine’s crime film Spring Breakers, that he fell asleep during his big sex scene. The rapper, who plays Big Arch, a rival drug dealer of James Franco’s Alien character in the film, is seen having sex with one woman, while another sucks his toes. “I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I was knocked out, snoring . . . Harmony kept having to wake me up for takes.” In another interview, he explained why he was so exhausted. “I had a concert down there in St Petersburg, Florida, one of the days I had to shoot a scene. Same night. We started shooting at 10 o\u0027clock in the evening until 1 or 2 o\u0027clock.”The action star broke his ankle while doing his own stunt on set of the sixth Mission Impossible. The scene sees Cruise completing a fast rooftop jump from one building to another, when his foot slams into the side of the wall. But instead of collapsing in a heap, he keeps going as if nothing has happened, until the end of the scene when he can be seen hobbling away. He said: “I knew instantly my ankle was broken and I really didn’t want to do it again so just got up and carried on with the take. I said, ‘It’s broken. That’s a wrap. Take me to hospital’ and then everyone got on the phone and made their vacation arrangement.”730 Lizzy Caplan and Michael Sheen – Masters of SexCaplan was nervous when she had to take her clothes off in front of co-star Sheen in the TV series. It made her feel better that they were both shaky. But then disaster struck. “And we complete the scene, I place the hand on my breast and they yell “Cut” and he immediately walks over to a garbage can and throws up.“ Turns out Sheen had eaten something that upset his stomach, but Caplan didn\u0027t know that. She said: ”My whole self-confidence plummeted to the ground and I realised that I\u0027m a monster and anybody who touches me will immediately start vomiting and that’s just the way it\u0027s going to be.”830 Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley – The Vampire DiariesNina Dobrev accidentally broke Paul Wesley\u0027s finger while shooting a sex scene in The Vampire Diaries.930 Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan - 50 Shades of GreyObviously this could be a load of hype to promote the first erotic film in the franchise, but there were certainly a lot of terrible sex scenes in which things could go wrong. Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele, becomes romantically linked to Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and they act out their BDSM desires. Johnson, who wore a modesty thong glued to her body while Dornan wore a “wee bag” to protect his modesty, said: “I got whiplash once from him throwing me on the bed. So f***ing painful. I wish we had a gag reel from the shoot.”Michael Imperioli is best known for his role as Tony Soprano’s protégé, Christopher Moltisanti in The Sopranos. During the filming of his death scene in Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas, Imperioli cut his hand on a glass and was taken to hospital, where the doctors sped in to treat his fake bullet wounds.During the filming of Groundhog Day, Murray was more irritable than usual as he was going through a orce and was prone to disappearing from set. He had been asked to get an assistant to ease communication between him, the director Harold Raims and the studio. He was against the idea, so he hired somebody who was deaf and spoke only in sign language, which nobody on set, including Murray, could understand. Ramis said: “Bill said, ‘Don’t worry, I\u0027m going to learn sign language.’ And I think it was so inconvenient that in a couple of weeks, he gave that up. That’s anti-communication, you know? Let’s not talk.”It was a small mishap for Dunham when her nude patch kept falling off in scenes that required nudity. Dunham, who plays aspiring writer Hannah in her comedy-drama TV series Girls, said: “I stopped wearing the nude patch after the first season of Girls. There’s not one guy who works on that show who hasn’t seen the inside of my vagina. You glue it over your vagina. It gets sweaty and always falls off. My male co-stars, at the end of the day, don’t care.”In one scene of Quentin Tarantino’s 2015 Western thriller, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue plays a guitar. It is a vintage Martin guitar from the 19th century, worth roughly $40,000, which had been loaned out from the Martin Museum in Pennsylvania. But a misunderstanding on Russell’s part led to an expensive mistake. The valuable guitar was meant to be swapped over with a replica prop when he snatched it from her. Russell had not read the memo, though, and smashed the antique guitar against a wall, while shouting “Music time is over”. As a result, the Martin Museum – which called the guitar a priceless, irreplaceable artefact – vowed never to loan guitars out to movies again.1430  Robert Pattinson and Julianne Moore – Maps to the StarsThe Twilight and Lost City of Z actor played Jerome, a limousine driver and struggling actor, in David Cronenberg’s acerbic Hollywood satire. It was while he got intimate in the back of a car with Moore’s character, a washed-up actress, that he ran into problems and started sweating profusely. “I sweat like a f***ing crazy person,” he said. “I was trying to literally catch drops of sweat to stop them hitting her back. Afterwards she was like, \u0027Are you having a panic attack?\u0027 It was so embarrassing.”1530 Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal - Love and other DrugsHathaway accidentally stripped off too soon when she thought cameras were rolling during the filming of Love and other Drugs. She stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in the erotic film based on the non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy. “I have to remove my trench coat and be nude underneath, and I thought we were filming,” she said. “But it turned out we were just rehearsing and I got unnecessarily naked in front of a lot of people!”In a 2007 episode of the reboot of Battlestar Galactica TV series, Olmos’s character William Adama, the commanding officer of BS Galactica, is playing around with a model ship when he gets carried away by improvising and smashes it to smithereens. The model ship was, however, museum quality and according to Olmos, who had no idea at the time, it was worth roughly $200,000.1730 Allison Janney and Michael Lerner in Life During WartimeDuring a sex scene against a wall for the 2009 comedy-drama, Allison Jamey\u0027s co-star Michael Lerner went crashing to the ground. “We had to have sex up against a wall and they started spraying us with glistening stuff to make us look sweaty, but no one seemed to realise that we were standing on a marble floor,” she said. “They said ‘Action’ and he pulled me up against the wall and his feet slipped out from under him and he went crashing down on the floor. It was terrible, but it was one of those moments I\u0027ll never forget.”1830 Ryan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde in The Change-UpThe Deadpool star was taken aback when his co-star Olivia Wilde painted smiley faces on her underwear during a sex scene, that he completely forgot what he was doing. “In the scene, she’s sitting there and I take her top off and the bra off, and she has those panties on, but she’s drawn these adorable little smiley faces on them,” he said. “And I forget every line. Not just from this movie, but from every other movie I’ve done.”1930 Sean Connery and Lana Turner – Another Time, Another PlaceSean Connery and the American actress Lana Turner were filming a love scene when Turner’s gangster boyfriend Johnny Stompanato showed up uninvited. Turner was playing an American journalist who has a love affair with a BBC war correspondent (played by Connery). But her boyfriend was so jealous that he showed up with a gun in his hand, and threatened to kill Connery. Bravely, Connery grabbed the gun from his hand and twisted the boyfriend’s wrist until he fled off the set. Turner’s turbulent life continued when her daughter Cheryl killed Stompanato with a kitchen knife fearing that he was going to kill her mother after he showed up at their house in the US – but in the trial it was deemed as justifiable homicide.2030 Christian Serratos and Michael Cudlitz - The Walking DeadThe long-running TV show focuses more on blood and violence than sex. But during one scene between Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) things nearly went pear-shaped when they had to get intimate in front of 30 crew members, who  were drinking coffee and eating ramen noodles. Cudlitz, who was on top of Serratos, said they were nearly naked but covered – but then as they were “humping”, the cover got knocked off, leaving Serratos practically naked. The actor said: “Then we just started laughing, because it\u0027s ridiculous. It\u0027s two people, we barely know each other, lying on top of each other naked.”During the filming of Blazing Saddles, a man wandered into a scene of the film. He wasn’t part of the crew or cast but when the director Mel Brooks got the man moved on, he returned again, seemingly not understanding the request. Brooks then sent over a waiver for him to sign and left him in the movie for a laugh. He can be spotted at the end of the film wearing a jumper and standing on a sidewalk watching the action as people run out of the Warner Brothers studio front gates.Not really a mishap, but it was certainly an awkward moment behind the camera for the then 17-year-old actor, who legally had to have his mother on set for his first-ever sex scene, in which he says, “It’s in. Oh, my God, it’s in.” “She got there, and I had fake sexual intercourse in front of her,” Mintz-Plasse said. “Afterwards we didn\u0027t talk about it we still don\u0027t speak about that moment.”2330 Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone – The SpecialistStallone and Stone had absolutely no chemistry in the 1994 American spy thriller, but when the Basic Instinct star refused to get naked for the shower scene, it was potentially a huge problem. Stallone admitted they had to get drunk on vodka for filming to even start. “Ok. Let it be known, I didn’t want this scene because Sharon was not cooperating. We get to the set and she decided not to take off her robe off. The director asks only a few of the crew to remain, and she still won’t take it off. I promised her I wouldn’t take any liberties, so what’s the problem? She said, ‘I’m just sick of nudity.’ I asked her if she could get sick of it on somebody else’s film. She was having none of it, so I went down to my trailer, bought back a bottle of Black Death vodka that was given to me by Michael Douglas and after half-a-dozen shots we were wet and wild.”2430 Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard – The Legend of TarzanApparently Robbie – who plays Jane - punched her Tarzan co-star Skarsgard after getting carried away during the filming of their climatic sex scene. The director David Yates asked them to be a little more violently passionate. “I didn’t injure Alexander,” she said. “And I didn’t punch him in the face, at least not hard. But he’s a pretty strong guy. He can take it. We just got carried away a bit.”Cavill says he had to “apologise profusely” after he got aroused on set, adding that “It had only happened to him once”. “A girl had to be on top of me, she had spectacular breasts and I hadn\u0027t rearranged my stuff into a harmless position. She\u0027s basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard.” He claimed there was nothing sexy about onscreen sex scenes. “All you’re doing is smacking your nuts against someone and nothing is going in.” But he added: “It’s not great when you’re in a professional acting environment and somebody gets a boner, is it?” It’s not just Henry Cavill who got aroused during filming a sex scene. Metcalfe, who played John Rowland, experienced the same issue during his first onscreen sex scene with Eva Longoria’s Gabrielle Solis. He said: “We were rehearsing and then the director was like, \u0027OK, get out of bed, we have to reset the set\u0027, and I was like, \u0027I need a minute.\u0027“ He added: “It doesn\u0027t happen that frequently” because ”there are a lot of people on set, and it can be very technical, but it happens from time to time.2730 Christopher Guest and Cary Elwes – The Princess BrideWhen you see the dashing Westley (Cary Elwes) fall to the ground unconscious during a fight scene in Rob Reiner’s The Princess Bride, it really happened. Christopher Guest, who was playing Count Tyrone Rugen, knocked Elwes out by accident, when he hit him on the head with the butt of his sword. Elwes also broke his toe during the first week of filming when he was “messing around” between scenes on co-star Andre the Giant’s all-terrain vehicle. But the actor, who was in his first major role, hid the injury for the rest of the film as best he could. “I was limping a bit, you can see it in some of the scenes – you can see that I was limping into the fire swamp (during a scene with Robin Wright).”The star was filming the scene in which he storms off after he discovers Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) has been renting out his brain to strangers. According to the director, Spike Jonze, a drunk extra then threw a beer can from a moving car at his head while shouting “Hey Malkovich, think fast!” Jonze liked the scene so much that he left it in the film. The extra had his day rate bumped up to $700 a day because he had a speaking role.2930 Viggo Mortensen – The Lord of the RingsWhen Aragon (Mortensen) thinks that two of the hobbits are dead in a scene in The Two Towers, he lets out a gigantic primeval cry as he kicks his helmet in anger and falls to the floor. This behaviour would seem like an appropriate response to the grief his character feels but in reality, the actor had actually broken two toes while kicking his helmet.3030 The entire cast of RoarBut whatever the mishap, nothing can surely be as bad as it was on set for director Noel Marshall’s family, who were cast in his 1981 adventure comedy film Roar? During filming, his then wife Tippi Hendren and her daughter Melanie Griffith, as well as his two sons, John and Jerry, were mauled by lions. Heddren suffered multiple scalp wounds while Marshall was bitten so many times, he ended up hospitalised with gangrene.130 Margot Robbie – The Wolf of Wall StreetThe actor says that acting in the scene where she has sex with Leonardo DiCaprio on a bed of money was really painful in The Wolf of Wall Street. “I got a million paper cuts on my back from all that money! It\u0027s not as glamorous as it sounds,” she said. “If anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don\u0027t. Or maybe real money is a bit softer, but the fake money is like paper, and when I got up off the bed, I turned around to get my robe and everyone gasped. I said, \u0027What is it?\u0027 And they said, \u0027You look like you\u0027ve been whipped a million times. Your back is covered in a thousand red scratches.”During the filming of the sequel to Steven Spielberg’s Jaws, cast members were terrified when real hammerhead sharks started circling them in the sea. The trouble was that their screams went unheard. The crew didn’t think they were in real danger to start with because it was written into the script that they yelled for help at that point.330 Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren – Rocky IVThe fourth in the Rocky film franchise to focus on the boxing career of the fictional Rocky Balboa, played by Sylvester Stallone, has some gripping and authentic-looking fight scenes. It’s no wonder then that during filming, Stallone actually asked Dolph Lundgren, who plays his opponent, Ivan Drago, to try to knock him out for real. But Lundgren hit him with such force that he was sent to the hospital and was in intensive care for over a week.Brando was infamous for his bad on-set behaviour. That is one reason why Paramount was nervous about getting him involved in Francis Ford Coppola’s mafia film. It didn’t start well, when on the first day of shooting, the actor who played the patriarch in the family, Vito Corleone, missed his overnight flight from LA to New York. His scene was rescheduled for the next day, but it cost producers $40,000.In his autobiography, rapper Gucci Mane said he was so tired on set of Harmony Korine’s crime film Spring Breakers, that he fell asleep during his big sex scene. The rapper, who plays Big Arch, a rival drug dealer of James Franco’s Alien character in the film, is seen having sex with one woman, while another sucks his toes. “I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I was knocked out, snoring . . . Harmony kept having to wake me up for takes.” In another interview, he explained why he was so exhausted. “I had a concert down there in St Petersburg, Florida, one of the days I had to shoot a scene. Same night. We started shooting at 10 o\u0027clock in the evening until 1 or 2 o\u0027clock.”The action star broke his ankle while doing his own stunt on set of the sixth Mission Impossible. The scene sees Cruise completing a fast rooftop jump from one building to another, when his foot slams into the side of the wall. But instead of collapsing in a heap, he keeps going as if nothing has happened, until the end of the scene when he can be seen hobbling away. He said: “I knew instantly my ankle was broken and I really didn’t want to do it again so just got up and carried on with the take. I said, ‘It’s broken. That’s a wrap. Take me to hospital’ and then everyone got on the phone and made their vacation arrangement.”730 Lizzy Caplan and Michael Sheen – Masters of SexCaplan was nervous when she had to take her clothes off in front of co-star Sheen in the TV series. It made her feel better that they were both shaky. But then disaster struck. “And we complete the scene, I place the hand on my breast and they yell “Cut” and he immediately walks over to a garbage can and throws up.“ Turns out Sheen had eaten something that upset his stomach, but Caplan didn\u0027t know that. She said: ”My whole self-confidence plummeted to the ground and I realised that I\u0027m a monster and anybody who touches me will immediately start vomiting and that’s just the way it\u0027s going to be.”830 Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley – The Vampire DiariesNina Dobrev accidentally broke Paul Wesley\u0027s finger while shooting a sex scene in The Vampire Diaries.930 Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan - 50 Shades of GreyObviously this could be a load of hype to promote the first erotic film in the franchise, but there were certainly a lot of terrible sex scenes in which things could go wrong. Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele, becomes romantically linked to Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and they act out their BDSM desires. Johnson, who wore a modesty thong glued to her body while Dornan wore a “wee bag” to protect his modesty, said: “I got whiplash once from him throwing me on the bed. So f***ing painful. I wish we had a gag reel from the shoot.”Michael Imperioli is best known for his role as Tony Soprano’s protégé, Christopher Moltisanti in The Sopranos. During the filming of his death scene in Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas, Imperioli cut his hand on a glass and was taken to hospital, where the doctors sped in to treat his fake bullet wounds.During the filming of Groundhog Day, Murray was more irritable than usual as he was going through a orce and was prone to disappearing from set. He had been asked to get an assistant to ease communication between him, the director Harold Raims and the studio. He was against the idea, so he hired somebody who was deaf and spoke only in sign language, which nobody on set, including Murray, could understand. Ramis said: “Bill said, ‘Don’t worry, I\u0027m going to learn sign language.’ And I think it was so inconvenient that in a couple of weeks, he gave that up. That’s anti-communication, you know? Let’s not talk.”It was a small mishap for Dunham when her nude patch kept falling off in scenes that required nudity. Dunham, who plays aspiring writer Hannah in her comedy-drama TV series Girls, said: “I stopped wearing the nude patch after the first season of Girls. There’s not one guy who works on that show who hasn’t seen the inside of my vagina. You glue it over your vagina. It gets sweaty and always falls off. My male co-stars, at the end of the day, don’t care.”In one scene of Quentin Tarantino’s 2015 Western thriller, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue plays a guitar. It is a vintage Martin guitar from the 19th century, worth roughly $40,000, which had been loaned out from the Martin Museum in Pennsylvania. But a misunderstanding on Russell’s part led to an expensive mistake. The valuable guitar was meant to be swapped over with a replica prop when he snatched it from her. Russell had not read the memo, though, and smashed the antique guitar against a wall, while shouting “Music time is over”. As a result, the Martin Museum – which called the guitar a priceless, irreplaceable artefact – vowed never to loan guitars out to movies again.1430  Robert Pattinson and Julianne Moore – Maps to the StarsThe Twilight and Lost City of Z actor played Jerome, a limousine driver and struggling actor, in David Cronenberg’s acerbic Hollywood satire. It was while he got intimate in the back of a car with Moore’s character, a washed-up actress, that he ran into problems and started sweating profusely. “I sweat like a f***ing crazy person,” he said. “I was trying to literally catch drops of sweat to stop them hitting her back. Afterwards she was like, \u0027Are you having a panic attack?\u0027 It was so embarrassing.”1530 Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal - Love and other DrugsHathaway accidentally stripped off too soon when she thought cameras were rolling during the filming of Love and other Drugs. She stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in the erotic film based on the non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy. “I have to remove my trench coat and be nude underneath, and I thought we were filming,” she said. “But it turned out we were just rehearsing and I got unnecessarily naked in front of a lot of people!”In a 2007 episode of the reboot of Battlestar Galactica TV series, Olmos’s character William Adama, the commanding officer of BS Galactica, is playing around with a model ship when he gets carried away by improvising and smashes it to smithereens. The model ship was, however, museum quality and according to Olmos, who had no idea at the time, it was worth roughly $200,000.1730 Allison Janney and Michael Lerner in Life During WartimeDuring a sex scene against a wall for the 2009 comedy-drama, Allison Jamey\u0027s co-star Michael Lerner went crashing to the ground. “We had to have sex up against a wall and they started spraying us with glistening stuff to make us look sweaty, but no one seemed to realise that we were standing on a marble floor,” she said. “They said ‘Action’ and he pulled me up against the wall and his feet slipped out from under him and he went crashing down on the floor. It was terrible, but it was one of those moments I\u0027ll never forget.”1830 Ryan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde in The Change-UpThe Deadpool star was taken aback when his co-star Olivia Wilde painted smiley faces on her underwear during a sex scene, that he completely forgot what he was doing. “In the scene, she’s sitting there and I take her top off and the bra off, and she has those panties on, but she’s drawn these adorable little smiley faces on them,” he said. “And I forget every line. Not just from this movie, but from every other movie I’ve done.”1930 Sean Connery and Lana Turner – Another Time, Another PlaceSean Connery and the American actress Lana Turner were filming a love scene when Turner’s gangster boyfriend Johnny Stompanato showed up uninvited. Turner was playing an American journalist who has a love affair with a BBC war correspondent (played by Connery). But her boyfriend was so jealous that he showed up with a gun in his hand, and threatened to kill Connery. Bravely, Connery grabbed the gun from his hand and twisted the boyfriend’s wrist until he fled off the set. Turner’s turbulent life continued when her daughter Cheryl killed Stompanato with a kitchen knife fearing that he was going to kill her mother after he showed up at their house in the US – but in the trial it was deemed as justifiable homicide.2030 Christian Serratos and Michael Cudlitz - The Walking DeadThe long-running TV show focuses more on blood and violence than sex. But during one scene between Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) things nearly went pear-shaped when they had to get intimate in front of 30 crew members, who  were drinking coffee and eating ramen noodles. Cudlitz, who was on top of Serratos, said they were nearly naked but covered – but then as they were “humping”, the cover got knocked off, leaving Serratos practically naked. The actor said: “Then we just started laughing, because it\u0027s ridiculous. It\u0027s two people, we barely know each other, lying on top of each other naked.”During the filming of Blazing Saddles, a man wandered into a scene of the film. He wasn’t part of the crew or cast but when the director Mel Brooks got the man moved on, he returned again, seemingly not understanding the request. Brooks then sent over a waiver for him to sign and left him in the movie for a laugh. He can be spotted at the end of the film wearing a jumper and standing on a sidewalk watching the action as people run out of the Warner Brothers studio front gates.Not really a mishap, but it was certainly an awkward moment behind the camera for the then 17-year-old actor, who legally had to have his mother on set for his first-ever sex scene, in which he says, “It’s in. Oh, my God, it’s in.” “She got there, and I had fake sexual intercourse in front of her,” Mintz-Plasse said. “Afterwards we didn\u0027t talk about it we still don\u0027t speak about that moment.”2330 Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone – The SpecialistStallone and Stone had absolutely no chemistry in the 1994 American spy thriller, but when the Basic Instinct star refused to get naked for the shower scene, it was potentially a huge problem. Stallone admitted they had to get drunk on vodka for filming to even start. “Ok. Let it be known, I didn’t want this scene because Sharon was not cooperating. We get to the set and she decided not to take off her robe off. The director asks only a few of the crew to remain, and she still won’t take it off. I promised her I wouldn’t take any liberties, so what’s the problem? She said, ‘I’m just sick of nudity.’ I asked her if she could get sick of it on somebody else’s film. She was having none of it, so I went down to my trailer, bought back a bottle of Black Death vodka that was given to me by Michael Douglas and after half-a-dozen shots we were wet and wild.”2430 Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard – The Legend of TarzanApparently Robbie – who plays Jane - punched her Tarzan co-star Skarsgard after getting carried away during the filming of their climatic sex scene. The director David Yates asked them to be a little more violently passionate. “I didn’t injure Alexander,” she said. “And I didn’t punch him in the face, at least not hard. But he’s a pretty strong guy. He can take it. We just got carried away a bit.”Cavill says he had to “apologise profusely” after he got aroused on set, adding that “It had only happened to him once”. “A girl had to be on top of me, she had spectacular breasts and I hadn\u0027t rearranged my stuff into a harmless position. She\u0027s basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard.” He claimed there was nothing sexy about onscreen sex scenes. “All you’re doing is smacking your nuts against someone and nothing is going in.” But he added: “It’s not great when you’re in a professional acting environment and somebody gets a boner, is it?” It’s not just Henry Cavill who got aroused during filming a sex scene. Metcalfe, who played John Rowland, experienced the same issue during his first onscreen sex scene with Eva Longoria’s Gabrielle Solis. He said: “We were rehearsing and then the director was like, \u0027OK, get out of bed, we have to reset the set\u0027, and I was like, \u0027I need a minute.\u0027“ He added: “It doesn\u0027t happen that frequently” because ”there are a lot of people on set, and it can be very technical, but it happens from time to time.2730 Christopher Guest and Cary Elwes – The Princess BrideWhen you see the dashing Westley (Cary Elwes) fall to the ground unconscious during a fight scene in Rob Reiner’s The Princess Bride, it really happened. Christopher Guest, who was playing Count Tyrone Rugen, knocked Elwes out by accident, when he hit him on the head with the butt of his sword. Elwes also broke his toe during the first week of filming when he was “messing around” between scenes on co-star Andre the Giant’s all-terrain vehicle. But the actor, who was in his first major role, hid the injury for the rest of the film as best he could. “I was limping a bit, you can see it in some of the scenes – you can see that I was limping into the fire swamp (during a scene with Robin Wright).”The star was filming the scene in which he storms off after he discovers Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) has been renting out his brain to strangers. According to the director, Spike Jonze, a drunk extra then threw a beer can from a moving car at his head while shouting “Hey Malkovich, think fast!” Jonze liked the scene so much that he left it in the film. The extra had his day rate bumped up to $700 a day because he had a speaking role.2930 Viggo Mortensen – The Lord of the RingsWhen Aragon (Mortensen) thinks that two of the hobbits are dead in a scene in The Two Towers, he lets out a gigantic primeval cry as he kicks his helmet in anger and falls to the floor.

I genuinely believe that he was, but on the biggest political crisis of British modern politics we were unable, via Jeremy, to be able to take a position.Watson says ‘brutality’ within Labour behind reason he quit“I think actually we should have stood our ground and argued our case.”The stance is in marked contrast to that of the other leadership candidates, including Rebecca Long Bailey, who finally broke her silence to confirm she plans to run.The shadow business secretary criticised the party’s Brexit position, saying “our compromise solution satisfied too few”, but she did not set out what the party should have done instead.Mr Lewis said that his personal experience on the doorstep had shown him that Mr Corbyn’s leadership was a problem for many voters.Created with Sketch.Who could replace Corbyn as Labour leader?

He is said to have a \u0027tremendous amount of support\u0027 in the partyThe former director of public prosecutions undoubtedly has ambitions to lead the party, and is highly-regarded by both left-wingers and centrists in the party. As Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, he played a key role in the party’s eventual backing of a second referendum. Treasury spokesman Clive Lewis has launched his bid for the leadership. He has criticised Corbyn\u0027s stance on Brexit and will stand as a pro-Remain candidate. He was an early supporter of a Final Say referendum and has described Brexit as a hard-right political project that Labour must fight with all its vigour.

She won also won plaudits for her performance filling in for Corbyn both at prime minister’s questions and during the general election debates.Party chairman Ian Lavery has said he is \u0027seriously considering\u0027 a bid for the leadership. Lavery is a Corbyn ally and it is hoped by supporters of the outgoing leader that he would continue with the party\u0027s current left-wing programme. He is said to have a \u0027tremendous amount of support\u0027 in the partyThe former director of public prosecutions undoubtedly has ambitions to lead the party, and is highly-regarded by both left-wingers and centrists in the party.

Only Canada comes close to the UK, with a threefold increase in average property prices.\u0026nbspHouse prices in the UK have also risen substantially faster than incomes. Average house prices are now almost twice as high relative to a measure of average household disposable income as they were 40 years ago.Andrew Bailey faces a host of challenges as next Bank of England chiefChronic undersupply of housing in the UK has frequently been blamed for pushing up prices but David Miles and Victoria Monro at the Bank of England found this has not been a significant driver.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade. They have sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world listening with me to every word of every story. I feel torn staring at them, joy at returning to my loved ones and the heartache of those I had to leave behind. Now they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up and lined up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away.….”David, 13, arrived in Uganda in July 2016 fleeing the civil war that broke out in South Sudan. He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking.

Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade.

He holds his father’s hand as they both huddle\u0026nbspby the stove for warmth. He has the haunting stare of a boy who knows he is\u0026nbspgoing to die, an expression that cuts through the paraffin haze of the dark room as temperatures fall below zero. Mohammed, his father, gaunt from grief, explains\u0026nbsphis son is two years overdue for an operation that could save his life.\u0026nbspWith no means to finance it, he raises\u0026nbsphis hands to the sky in hope that his prayers would be answered.\u0026nbspI remember waiting to see my doctor as a child.

All the while, their president publicly feasts\u0026nbspin lavish establishments. Roughly 3.5 million Venezuelans, among them doctors, lawyers and teachers, have left their country, out of starvation and fear.Joender, aged six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela, arrived in\u0026nbspIpiales, Colombia, exhausted and hungry. He was offloaded with his family from a galvanised lorry like cattle, after a 33-day journey, mostly on foot, where they were forced to beg for food to survive. His cupped hands are\u0026nbsprewarded with a packet of biscuits donated by a local in the town. He clutches\u0026nbspthe packet like a prize.

He was\u0026nbspgiven away by his biological parents to a more affluent household and\u0026nbspforced into a life of domestic servitude. The feeling of being abandoned proves\u0026nbspto be too much for him. Standing in the kitchen and washing dishes, he simply shrugs his small shoulders, and one by one the tears roll\u0026nbspdown his face.

In a dark room in remote north western Tanzania, she explains\u0026nbsphow not going to school saddens\u0026nbspher.

Mamoke didn’t have a choice, but that was because the right of education was unavailable to her. I realise I have taken so much\u0026nbspfor granted in my life.

How low-carbon can you go  Reduce meat and dairy consumption, as beef and sheep livestock have a high carbon footprint. If you’re not ready to go completely without, try Meat Free Mondays Grow your own: You don’t need a big garden. Salad leaves, chilli and herbs are just a few of the things that grow well in containers. It’s a low-cost way of reducing your reliance on super-market fruit and vegetables. Switch off when idle: Leaving TVs, games consoles, the washing machine and microwave on standby eats energy. Some appliances draw energy even when they are not being used and phone chargers are among the worst culprits. “Vampire power” costs each house up to £ a year, according to the Energy Saving Trust. Use energy-saving lightbulbs: LED bulbs can last up to , hours, while some newer models are good for double that. As they use far less energy, you will quickly see impressive savings on your energy bill each month. Which  magazine puts the annual cost of running an LED lightbulb at £., compared to £. for a CFLtype and £. for halogen. Over the course of an LED bulb’s very long letime, it can save you around £. Be a careful cook: Only use as much water as you need and cover your pans so you save energy. Overfilling your kettle is a waste of electricity so only boil as much as you need. Lose the plastic packaging: This wrapping is energy-intensive in its production and causes serious damage to habitats. Choose items that are light on packaging, and refill as much as possible. There is no reason to buy tomatoes on a plastic tray which is also wrapped in plastic. A loose tomato tastes just as good. Find out more about the supermarkets’ war against plastic. Go low: Set the washing machine at C or even C. Doing the laundry at C instead of C can be one third cheaper on energy. For lightly soiled clothes, try C. And make sure that your machine is full. Get free water-saving devices: Moving water around the country and treating it requires huge amounts of energy, so get in touch with your water company to find out what gadgets you can get for free, such as low-flow shower heads which use less water. Make your home cosy: Draught-proof your doors and windows, install secondary-film glazing, top up your loft insulation to cm and get your boiler serviced. Accord-ing to the Energy Saving Trust, loft insulation for a semi-detached house will cost around £, with £ savings a year, while insulating a mid-terrace house will cost around £ and save £ a year. Turn down radiators in rooms you are not using: You don’t need to heat a room you’re not in, so use radiator controls to adjust temperature. Slow down on fast fashion: We buy more and more clothes each year. So choose vintage items, rent something for those special occasions and don’t forget charity shops. Oxfam has a great online shop. For outfit rentals, try websites like byrotation, hirestreetuk and mywardrobehq. If you do really want to buy new clothes, look out for certications of sustain-ability. Use the Good On You app to find out which shops are reducing their impact on the environment. Watch super-market air miles: Potatoes do not rack up air miles like imported rice. Likewise, dairy has a high carbon footprint, so swap a latte for a regular coffee. Look for the Red Tractor symbol on food supplied by British farmers. Buy strawberries, for example, from Norfolk, not Morocco.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But there is still work to do.Top-down control over who gets a chance to be a candidate is demoralising and messy.And they are still outnumbered by Labour’s membership. It’s time to ride the Boris wave and add , new members to the blue ranks.If Labour keep telling themselves Magic Grandad is perfect, and blaming the voters, then this is a chance for the Conservatives to steal a march.WHILE this dwindling decade was stuffed full of exciting political events, it was not a vintage era for decisive majority ­government.There have been thrills — from voters defying Project Fear to free our country from the EU, through to Boris ­Johnson’s crushing victory over Corbynism.And there have been spills — David Cameron’s abrupt exit from power, Theresa May’s loss of her majority, and the hijack of the Labour Party by the far Left. But there have been only a few moments — mere months in the past ten years — of certain, stable, clear government.We have had two hung parliaments, the uncomfortable alliance of the coalition, and a slim Tory majority which was swtly erted by the EU referendum.At Westminster’s worst, a Remainer Commons — helped by a self-indulgent Speaker — trapped a minority Government in office while denying it the power to do anything.It’s all been very entertaining, but entertainment value is not always a sign of great governmentToo often, hung parliaments and paralysed ministers proved unable to make urgent decisions.Important calls were postponed or fudged out of necessity, because the votes to get on with the job were simply not there.Smashing that obstacle to decision-making is one of the many things about the election result to celebrate.Getting Brexit done should only be the start of the changes made by a Government that at last has the chance to be radical and ambitious.Not everybody will be cheering, however. Obviously, the Opposition aren’t happy. And I expect we will soon see some signs of unhappiness from the upper ranks of the civil service, too.Why  First, because theof majority government is a rude intrusion into the lives of civil service chiefs after a decade in which they got used to getting their own way.The absence of clear authority under May, and before that the many tensions and fractures of the coalition years, offered plenty of opportunity for determined mandarins to manage things just as they liked. No longer.Second, because the days in which the civil service was truly neutral, from top to bottom, have sadly ended — and a troubling number of officials seem to feel it is their role to promote a particular view.Brexit has exposed that bias. In the referendum campaign, public bodies which should know better allowed themselves to be used to pump out Remain propaganda, damaging their reputations.The agenda — to try to delay, disrupt and deny Brexit — was obvious. The election result has at last convinced all but the most diehard EU fans that we really are going to leave.But this is not the only issue on which the Government and parts of officialdom disagree.From Michael Gove’s criticism of experts, to Downing Street’s belief that Whitehall is overdue for radical restructuring and reform, there are changes on the way which will disrupt a state of affairs that rather suited a lot of senior people.If the New Year sees whole departments abolished or merged, and a new culture of ministers challenging the sacred cows of Whitehall thinking, then the machine will fight back, hoping to undermine change and keep things the same. There are three ways for ministers and their advisers to defend against that assault.First, steel themselves for a bumpy ride. They’ll be briefed against by past masters of the targeted Whitehall leak who have little to lose. They must not let themselves be knocked off course.Second, they must find allies. For every hidebound part of the civil service, there are others chafing to see things done better. Bring them on board.Third, they should make full use of their power to make public appointments.Labour stuffed the ious quangos and commissions with like-minded people, with similar principles and priorities.Why wouldn’t they  It would be bizarre for a government to appoint its opponents to wield state power against its agenda.And yet that is exactly what the Tories have too often done, apparently through a misguided sense of fair play.It’s time to realise that the other side neverthe favour. Boris and his team know that the election was the start, not the end, of their job.They have to deliver the change that they promised, to fulfil the trust voters put in them. There are battles ahead to make that happen, and wrestling Whitehall will be one of the biggest.

Sunday Political Editor David Wooding hands out his annual gongs – The Wooders.Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson deluded herself she would be the next PM and toured the land in a coach bearing her giant mugshot on the side.But she didn’t even manage to win her own seat back.At least it cheered up the second most annoying party leader, the SNP’s Nicola Sturgeon, who punched the air in glee at claiming her Scots rival’s scalp.You wait two years for a Labour star to jump ship — then he does it twice in a few weeks.Following his aborted leadership bid, Chuka Umunna launched a new party, Change UK.But he became so fond of change, he did it again and joined the Lib Dems.Now he’s coping with more change after voters booted him out.Expelled left-winger Derek Hatton is readmitted into the Labour Party after a -year wait — only to be kicked out again  hours later.Comeback king Nigel Farage launched the Brexit Party.But within hours, pranksters registered its email address as a porn site.He was swamped with offers from East European women offering a “stress-free” massage.Bet he needed a rub down after his party bombed in the election.John Bercow stood down as Commons Speaker after ten years and was then accused of demanding £million to appear on TV’s I’m A Celebrity.He denied the claims but Brexit-backing MPs would happily have paid Remainer Bercow handsomely to get him out of the Westminster jungle.Naughty-but-nice Trade Secretary Liz Truss attended The Big Sausage event in Norfolk, saying it was, “ticking rather a lot of my boxes”.Asked to try a Gloucester Old Spot banger, she enthused: “That’s one of the best offers I’ve had all year.”It perhaps explains why Liz enjoyed working in a well-hung Parliament so much.Housing minister James Brokenshire showed off his new kitchen which boasts FOUR matching ovens.The revelation must have left the PM wondering where to put his “oven-ready” Brexit deal.It prompted one stunned MP to ask: “Is he running a pizza business on the side ”A miserable year for Jeremy Corbyn as his party and football team tanked.After his election defeat, the Labour leader assured fellow Arsenal fans he wouldn’t be applying for the vacant job of Gunners team boss.Just as well, as he’d probably borrow £billion to buy more left wingers and strikers but remain neutral on whether to play in Europe.Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg was dubbed “insolent” and “insufferable” when he reclined almost horizontally on the Commons’ green benches during a late-night Brexit debate.He refused to budge, amid cries of, “Sit up, man!”But the posh wind-up merchant smiled and nodded when one angry MP sarcastically suggested he should be supplied with a pillow.Spoon-bending psychic Uri Geller vowed to use his “telepathic powers” to stop Jeremy Corbyn becoming PM.After the election, he claimed he influenced Boris Johnson’s landslide victory by giving him a spoon energised with “mind positivity”.Chris “Failing” Grayling quit as Transport Secretary after a string of Brexit planning blunders — including awarding a cross-Channel ferry contract to a firm with no ships.Labour Deputy Leader Tom Watson shed st in two years by giving up sugar and taking up exercise.He became so thin that Corbynista “assassins” missed their target in a plot to oust him.Slimline Watson then decided to cast off his ­political baggage and quit as an MP.Shadow Education Secretary Angela ­Rayner has been showered with compliments about her figure after going on a “half-portions” diet.She quipped: “Fat birds don’t win elections.”Neither do slim turkeys when Corbyn is leader.Boris Johnson almost botched his leadership bid after a “screaming row” with his girlfriend over a wine stain on her sofa.Police were called by neighbours who reported “a lot of smashing” from the home he shared with Carrie Symonds.What happened next remains secret.Perhaps it was a ­cover-up — by an upholstery firm.Cops ordered a McDonald’s outlet to stop selling milkshakes during a rally by Nigel Farage in Edinburgh — in case they were used as missiles by customers.The Brexit Party boss completed the visit unscathed, only to be “milkshaked” in Newcastle.Loveable No pup Dilyn outshines ­Cameron, May, Johnson and even Larry the Downing Street cat.The seven-month-old Jack Russell-cross from an animal rescue charity moved in with BoJo’s girlfriend Carrie and always steals the show at official receptions.A real yappy ending.Hapless Karen Bradley admitted she didn’t believe a word she said as Northern Ireland Secretary.She dropped a clanger by saying that killings by the military and police during The Troubles were not crimes — then rowed back, insisting: “I want to be very clear. I do not believe what I said. That is not my view.”Boris Johnson brandished a kipper at his leadership hustings.But his claim that he couldn’t have it delivered by post because of EU rules proved very fishy.Channel  replaced no-shows Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage with melting ice sculptures during a debate on climate change.Viewers probably judged their performance to be less drippy than Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson’s.Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson was sacked after an inquiry into who leaked details of a National Security Council meeting over plans to allow Chinese telecoms giant Huawei to help build Britain’s G network.Downing Street said the PM had, “lost confidence in his ability to serve”, but he soon ed to Cabinet.All sounds a bit, er, phoney.Boris likened himself to The Incredible Hulk as he vowed to break free from EU shackles.But when he showed schoolkids an image of the superhero during a school visit, a boy pointed at the huge muscles and said: “You’ve got boobies.”She failed to secure a Brexit deal and lost the Tories’ majority.Yet Theresa May soldiered on with everyone against her.When toppled, she didn’t quit Parliament in a huff or carp endlessly from the backbenches but showed more loyalty to her successor than he gave to her.Mrs May could prove to be the finest ex-PM Britain ever had.Remainer lawyer Gina Miller blew thousands trying to stop Brexit — but unwittingly helped deliver it.Her court victory gave Brexit-blocker MPs the right to vote down Theresa May’s “soft” departure deal.But it set off a chain of events that put Bojo in No with a majority big enough to force through a much cleaner Brexit. Thanks, Gina.They spent the past three and a half years plotting to stop Brexit at every turn.But at the General Election, voters sent them a clear message: Leave Parliament.So good riddance to Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry, David Gauke, Laura Pidcock, Chuka Umunna, Jo Swinson, Philip Lee, Antoinette Sandbach and Sam Gyimah. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But just before we say goodbye to this year, I’ve been thinking about all the brilliant women who did brave, groundbreaking and seriously inspiring things in .Here, in no particular order, are my pick of those who really stood out — and hopefully will continue to do so for some time to come.It’s been a very mixed year for her. The country has had a tumultuous time, going to the polls and with two Prime Ministers.Her grandsons were apparently feuding and she had to be seen to be laying down the law to Prince Andrew.History may well judge  as her second annus horribilis.Yet somehow, this amazing woman has been the very definition of a dignied, strong and steady leader, offering us the stability and reassurance we as a country so desperately need.Yes, I know women’s football has been going on for years.But  was the year our Lionesses put it firmly on the map.Not only that, they have also inspired a generation of girls to get their boots on and play, knowing they can be just as good as boys on the pitch.So although it’s a shame it’s taken this long, we all owe them a debt of gratitude.I have long admired Emily for asking the hard questions on BBC’s Newsnight.But this year, in the face of the extreme hotting-up of Brexit, culminating in December’s General Election, her coverage has been second to none .Then her grilling of Prince Andrew in November was a masterclass in conducting a good interview — clinical, forensic and meticulous, without a hint of deference.Never shouty or confrontational, she gave Andrew the space to show himself to the public so they could make up their own minds about his culpability in his relationship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.She also somehow managed not to make herself the storyalthough when Prince Andrew described Epstein’s actions as “unbecoming”, she took the chance to look as disgusted as we all feel.“Unbecoming ” she said. “He was a sex offender.”In short, she nailed him.That photo of her wearing the world’s most beautul dress, martini and cigarette in hand at the Emmys after-party, said it all.Earlier in the night she had won three of the four Emmys she was up for — just more in a long line of awards and accolades this year, during which she proved the brilliance of Fleabag was not a one-off.Her sharp, witty and totally original writing on Killing Eve showed she is seriously clever as well as unbelievably glamorous.And her portrayal of women is original, transgressive and totally refreshing.No wonder she was drafted in to give her input and perspective on the next Bond movie.I have a feeling that in  we will realise Phoebe Waller-Bridge is only just getting started.She has had her first baby, conducted her first royal tour and guest edited Vogue. Oh, and she met Beyonce.All in all, not a bad year! She has also managed to consistently put on a brave and happy face while on the receiving end of more criticism than most of us could stand.But it is her le-long passion for and commitment to feminism I admire most.On International Women’s Day, she said: “Men can understand that they can be feminists,” and should feel comfortable about women being by their side, rather than behind them.As we know all too well, not everyone likes a strong woman. But because she is strong, my view is that she will win over her critics in the end.Leave it to the women to organise, unite and provide support to local women in their community and provide support for those affected by the terrible tragedy of the Grenfell fire.Their aim is to provide a networking  and discussion forums for women and arrange positive actions and initiatives that will help the community. But above all, they want to remember — which is why they organise a monthly silent walk in memory of their “lost angels”.My heart breaks for them that they have to do this.But what a brilliant reminder of the power of organisation and women coming together to support each other.Earlier this year, at an equal pay tribunal brought against the BBC by the TV and radio presenter, Samira said she: “Could not understand how pay for me, a woman, could be so much lower than Jeremy Vine, a man, for presenting very similar programmes and doing very similar work . . .“I just ask why the BBC thinks I am worth only a sixth of the value of the work of a man for doing a very similar job.”On behalf of every woman who has felt she should have said something, should have done something, should have spoken out, stood up or walked out when they knew they were being paid less than men in similar roles, but who felt they had no choice but to put up with it, I salute her.I also want to give a mention to the captain of the US women’s soccer team.Yes, she is a great player. But people have lined up to criticise her because she is another strong woman who seems genuinely not to care what people think of her and what she says.They describe her in the US as a “badass” and there is no doubt that she is outspoken on every issue going.But it is her ongoing campaign to normalise gay relationships in sport that really resonates with me.Working in a sport where no male has ever come out as gay while playing in the Premier League, it seems sad — and unacceptable — that people can’t be open about being gay.I think Megan is helping to change that, though.Asked in an interview how it felt to lead the US team, she replied: “Go gays!”She continued: “You can’t win a championship without gays on your team. It’s never been done before. Ever.”Could any collection of amazing women be complete without a mention of the -year-old schoolgirl who has started an international revolution Everything this young woman has done — and she has done more than anyone I can think of to raise awareness about the climate emergency — has been made so much more impressive because of her tenacity in the face of such extreme criticism.Most of the youngster’s critics seem to be men of a certain age who are, I guess, threatened by someone so young and female being so bold, opinionated and unconcerned about what they think.Amazingly, the insults and attacks seem only to have empowered her further and fuelled her determination to make the world listen to what we need to do to try to stop climate change in its tracks.A slip of a girl — and a teen at that — is changing the world.Bravely, and in the face of extreme confrontation at times, she has created a movement where millions around the world follow her and listen to her.She has turned down many accolades because she is not in it for the adulation. She really just wants to make change happen. Truly inspirational.A bit like female Prime Ministers, female newspaper editors are a rarer breed than male ones.Women have such an important role to play in journalism and in fighting for equality.And now, for the first time in  years, there will be a female editor of the Financial Times, which really is groundbreaking, given the paper has been such a bastion of male power for so long.Roula is going to do a magnicent job, not least because she is so focused on increasing newsroom ersity and attracting more female readers, which gives her an obvious spot among my Women of the Year.And a final mention must go to Dr Nyla Raja, purely for personal reasons.She has transformed my skin this year.Everyone needs a great facial and a little help . . . and boy, does she deliver!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its much more concerning for private citizens, like those who have been involved in policing or counter-terrorism or other such sensitive cases, to have their addresses published.The addresses of Englands World Cup-winning cricket team, as well as performers such as Sir Elton John and Grease star Olivia Newton-John were published.The list also included senior diplomats, counter-terror police and figures from the military. Lawyers warned last night that the compensation bill could run into the millions.Sean Humber, a data breach specialist at law firm Leigh Day, said: “Those iniduals on the list affected by the data breach are likely to have claims for compensation for unauthorised disclosure of their personal information, including for any anxiety or distress suffered, as well as the costs for any reasonable action they now feel they need to take as a result of the blunder.”Mark Stephens, media and privacy expert at law firm Howard Kennedy, said: “This is an unforgivable breach of data protection. The people adversely affected would be entitled to make a joint claim for compensation in the High Court.”Silkie Carlo, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said it was extremely worrying to see that the Government doesnt have a basic grip on data protection, adding: Its a farcical and inexcusable mistake, especially given the new Data Protection Act passed by the Government last year - it clearly cant stick by its rules.Lord Kerslake, who was head of the civil service between  and , said an urgent investigation was needed.He said: It is a serious and indeed extraordinary breach because this is a well-established process that has gone on in pretty much the same way for years, so I think an urgent investigation is certainly needed.Of course, its likely to be human error, as has been suggested, but we need to know how well staff were trained about the importance of maintaining security. Were they briefed on the potential consequencesthis information was released The introduction of General Data Protection Regulationrules in May  increased the penalties regulators such as the ICO are able to introduce.It means breaches can result in the ICO issuing penalties equivalent of up to  per cent of annual global turnover or £million - whichever is greater.Previously, the largest penalty the ICO meted out was to Facebook when it was fined £, - the maximum allowed at the time - for failing to protect users personal data.But in July, the ICO announced its intention to fine British Airways £million for its own data breach, which will become the largest penalty ever issued by the regulator once the process is completed.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

What makes it more unusual was the temperature came at am.It was still short of the record for December, however, which stands at .C recorded on December   in Achnashellach, in the Highlands of Scotland.In the UK, the most notable Foehn events tend to occur across the Scottish Highlands where the moist prevailing westerly winds encounter high ground along Scotlands west coast.This results in a marked contrast in weather conditions across the country with the west being subjected to wet weather, while the lower lying east enjoys the warmth and sunshine of the Foehn effect.Overnight on Saturday into Sunday, mild air from Africa pushed across the UK.

We accept what happened but the process that led to this verdict was unjust.Rather than a simplistic suicide verdict, we wanted a narrative verdict which would act as an official record saying that while it was likely a suicide, they could not be  per cent certain because there are factors which suggest otherwise.Ian Singleton, assistant coroner for Wiltshire and Swindon, told the inquest that the death of -year-old Kelly could not be a cry for help because the location was so isolated that no-one would have seen her.If you are affected by any of the issues raised in this article, please call the Samaritanson  or   .The CCTV on the train was, unusually, not working, so the drivers vivid description of Kellys final moments is the main witness account of how she died.But Mr Stooke said: There are far more isolated bridges along the railway line and there are cars flowing across that one all the time, so I believe Kelly hoped someone would notice her climbing over the parapet and have her taken into a secure facility.The driver was in shock, and we dont blame him, so he may not be  per cent certain about what he saw.Plus, Kelly only had a few cuts and abrasions, and no skull fractures, after being hit - the damage should have been much greater.Maybe she tried to get out of the way but it was too late.Testimony from a mental health consultant and Kellys GP revealed that she had talked about suicidal thoughts similar to how she later died. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBetween Brexit, the election and a new prime minister, itaposs been a long and confusing year in politics. Rules, benefit systems - even the date weaposre going to leave the EU - have been repeatedly chopped and changed. And many of the changes made to our laws and budgets donapost take effect immediately. Most will involve some lead time before the changes come into force - so itaposs easy to forget whataposs coming up. So weaposve rounded up  of the major changes to UK law, benefits, financial and employment rules that are set to take place in . They include increases to the minimum wage, new rights for gig economy workers and changes to the laws on gay marriage and abortion in Northern Ireland. Read on to see how theyaposll affect you and your family. January : Rail fares rise by .% Rail fares are to jump by an average of .% as the latest inflation-linked hike kicks in. Some long-distance commuters will see the annual cost of getting to work increase by more than £ on  January. It means a £, season ticket will rise by £., while a London to Guildford annual ticket, which typically costs £, will rise by £ to £,. January : Gay marriage is legalised in Northern Ireland Northern Irelandaposs ban on same-sex marriage will officially come to an end, after Westminster politicians stepped in and changed the law. Although the weddings will be legal from this date, bureaucracy means the first civil same-sex marriages are expected to take place on the week of Valentineaposs Day. March : Alcohol minimum pricing launches in Wales The Welsh Government is planning on a new law setting minimum alcohol prices, WalesOnline reports. Currently set to come into force on March , , ministers want retailers and bars to charge a minimum of p per unit - meaning a can of cider could cost at least £ and a bottle of wine, £.. Health minister Vaughan Gething confirmed the start date in a statement to Assembly members in October. However, the regulations which will set out the timetable and minimum prices, still need to be approved by the Welsh Assembly. The policy has already been delayed from last summer. March : The right to request decent affordable broadband Hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses have the choice of slow broadband, hideously expensive broadband, or no broadband. Thataposs set to end for many with a new right called the Universal Service Obligation. From March , anyone can request a connection that can deliver  megabits per seconddownload speed and  Mbps upload speed and costs less than £ per month. If you donapost have internet of this quality, you have the legal right to request it, as long as the installation would cost less than £,. If it costs more, you can still have broadband installed but may have to pay the excess cost. The scheme is being administered by BT and KCOM in Hull. Once a request is made, there are set standards for how quickly they must assess and deliver on requests. March : Abortion is made legal in Northern Ireland From the end of March, women in Northern Ireland will be allowed to terminate pregnancies without fear of prosecution. That means the region will be brought in line with the rest of the UK by the beginning of April. The change was approved by the UK Parliament as part of the Northern IrelandBill - introducing the law in the absence of the collapsed devolved government. From April, abortion services will be available from two hospitals. Buffer zones will be in place to prevent protests outside the centres. Itaposs thought around , will take place each year in Northern Ireland. April : Councils can double council tax for empty homes  Property owners can already face Council Tax bills increasing by %they leave properties vacant for more than two years. And from April, that figure increases to % - potentially doubling the charge for homes left empty for long periods of time.  April : Hospital parking charges axed - for some Hospital parking charges for thousands of NHS patients and staff will be scrapped in England from April . Blue badge holders, frequent outpatients and parents of sick kids are among the groups that will benefit from the Tory pledge - which comes after a long Mirror campaign. But not all NHS staff and patients will get free parking, as they would have done under Labouraposs plans. Instead of being scrapped altogether, the £m-a-year paid to park at NHS hospitals will be scaled back by just under a third, saving patients and staff up to £m a year. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it would prioritise those with the greatest need adding: One of the concerns mentioned regularly on the doorsteps was that vulnerable people, and staff working nights, have to pay for hospital car parking. So we are today delivering on our manesto commitment and setting out our new approach to NHS hospital parking charges.  Weaposre currently expecting a new rate of £. for those aged  and over, up from £. an hour now, but the exact figure canapost be confirmed yet. New hourly rates for the following April are announced in the Budget, which we are only expecting in February due to delays around the election. April : Changes to rights for agency and gig economy workers Currently, when people who earn ying amounts of money from week-to-week - particularly those on flexible contracts - take a paid holiday, the employer has to pay them holiday pay which equates to the average weekly wage they earned over the  weeks before that holiday. From April , , that is changing. Employers will have to calculate the average weekly wage from an entire year -  weeks - rather than just  weeks. The reform is intended to improve the holiday pay for seasonal workers, who tend to lose out over the way it is currently calculated. Written statement Employers will also be required to provide a aposstatement of particularsapos on day one of employment - which must include:Hours and days of the week the worker employee is required to work, whether they may be ied and how Entitlements to paid leave Details of any probationary period Details of training provided by the employerParental bereavement leave Way back in , the Government backed a Private Members bill which proposed giving workers the right to unpaid leave of up to two weeks, as a right, from day one of their employment, should they suffer the tragedy of their child dying under the age of . This became law in September, , and is expected to come into force in early . While most employers do give discretionary compassionate leave in such tragic circumstances, some do not. This law, which also applies to women who suffer a stillbirth or miscarriage from the th week of pregnancy, changes that. April : National Insurance is cut by up to £ a year The Tories pledged to raise national insurance thresholds in their manesto. From April, you will pay no national insurance contributions on the first £, of your earnings - up from £, at the moment - working out as a saving of around £ a year.The move has been criticised for falling short of the £-a-year Boris Johnson promised, and only helping better earners who are already over the threshold.For others itaposs not quite the all out win you might think - with the move meaning some of the worst off might now miss out on some of their state pension as a result. Steven Cameron, pensions director at Aegon, said: “Under current rules, those not paying any NI lose out on credits towards their state pension. Iniduals need  years of qualying NICs to receive the full state pension with those with fewer qualying years seeing a reduction and receive nonethey have fewer than  years of credits.” April : Tories will let families inherit £million tax free - finishing what George Osborne started Families will be able to pass £m of their wealth without Inheritance Tax when they die. Currently someone who dies can leave £, of their estate tax-free. But Tory George Osborne added an extra extra tax-free amount that applies only to property. In April this extra portion rises from £, to £, - meaningsomeone owns a home, they can leave £, tax free. This doublesa couple is married. April : Student loan repayments will fall  People paying back student loans get a minor tax break in April too. Recent graduates will be able to earn £, a year before payments kick in - up from £, this year. That should save them £. in payments a year. People who graduated between  and  will see their threshold rise too - from £, a year to £,. April : State pension will rise by .% The state pension will rise by .% from April - more than double the rate of inflation. Such an increase means pensioners can expect an rise of just over £ per week on the New State Pension from the current rate of £.. But hundreds of thousands of over-s will see around half their pension rise wiped out by the cost of paying for their own TV licence, after the benefit was scrapped. Tory ministers pledged to protect the state pension with a apostriple lockapos. That means it rises by inflation, .% or average earnings - whichever is highest. Average weekly earnings rose by .% in the year to May to July . April : Benefit freeze ends After almost a decade of freezes and caps, about . million people on Universal Credit and millions more on legacy benefits will get a .% increase in April. The increase means someone on £ a month in benefits will get an extra £.. But it is less than the rise in average earnings and less than the rise in pensions. April: Council tax to rise Local authorities will get the power to raise council tax by up to % from April - % for general spending and % for social care. Thataposs worth an extra £ to on the average band D council tax home in England. Council-by-council rises will only be confirmed in February and March. June : The end of free TV Licences for over s TV Licences are free for over s, but from June  youaposll only get oneyouaposre receiving Pension Credit. Around million households are set to be affected.BBC chairman David Clementi said:“Copying the current scheme was ultimately untenable.But the Tories were slammed for breaking their promise to protect the benefit by handing over responsibility for it to the BBC. July or later: Millions will start being moved onto Universal Credit The limited pilot scheme for migrating existing benefit claimants onto Universal Credit is set to finish by July  and begin rolling out across the country shortly after. Current plans suggest it will take until  until the system is fully up and running. From July claimants moving from Income Support, income based Jobseekeraposs Allowance and Employment Support Allowance will get an extra two weeks of support from their old benefit while they transition onto Universal Credit. October : The state pension age will finish rising to  From October youaposll need to be at least  to get a state pension - whatever your gender. The age people can at has been rising for years - starting with increasing womenaposs state pension age until it matched menaposs, then increasing both from  to . AJ Bell analyst Tom Selby said: “The rise started incrementally in  and is scheduled to complete by October . That means anyone born after  October  will have a state pension age of at least . Itaposs not the last time it will rise though. The Conservatives have set out plans to increase the state pension age again to  by  and  by , Selby added.

Will Boris Johnson be found out  What does the future hold for Labour  Should we brace ourselves for four more years of Trump  Will the FBI feel Prince Andrew’s collar  And what about Brexit  The stakes are high with the only certainty being an alarming uncertainty for the next  months. Brexit Cynical liar Boris Johnson wants Brexit talk banned because he knows it won’t be done by the end of January. The UK is leaving Brussels’ political institutions but little changes immediately as we remain in the customs union and single market until at least the end of . My hunch is the Tory charlatan fails to negotiate a £billion free trade deal by December  and instead of Brexitgeddon he begs for an economic leline. The £million a week NHS Brexit idend never existed. Boris Johnson The Con-servative will be found out in the next  months, his celebrity gloss fading quickly as scales fall from the public’s eyes. Lies eventually catch up with fibbers and that -seat Parliamentary majority gives him nobody  to blame when he fails to deliver. Broken promises are Johnson’s trademark. Just ask his ex-wives and girlfriends. Labour I firmly believe Wigan warrior Lisa Nandy would be Labour’s wisest choice in March. But I’m beginning to wondertoolmaker’s son Keir Starmer might pip continuity Corbynista candidate Rebecca Long-Bailey. The former DPP chief prosecutor is gaining momentum while Momentum’s failing to get Salford solicitor Long-Bailey going. One-time teenage mum Angela Rayner is a shoe-in for deputy. Economy Wages are tipped by the Resolution Foundation tofinally to ’s value, after the worst squeeze for two centuries. Yet economic growth will struggle to match this year’s weak .%. It’s a myth Tory leech doctors are better for the nation’s prosperity, with average annual GDP growth per head in Conservative years below .%, a third less than the .% in a Labour era that included a global banking collapse. Donald Trump  Most recent US Presidents won second terms and I fear the gross ignoramus may in November again lose the popular vote but be gted the White House by an electoral college favouring Republicans. Fact checkers counted nearly , Trump lies and untrue statements in  and his % approval rating is historically low. But this contest is decided by tiny margins in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Florida. Obama’s old deputy, Joe Biden, is the likely, uninspiring rival unless Democrats gamble on Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg or Bernie Sanders. NHS Tories are applying a sticking plaster to gaping wounds they inflicted when Johnson’s “record” £billion extra by  is £billion in real terms – or .%. That’s below the historical average .% rise, never mind the % under Blair and Brown. Record waiting lists and times will fall a little but the NHS will be stuck on a trolley in the corridor with social care ignored. Schools  Begging letters will continue to come to parents and classroom staff will be sacked as most schools in England suffer more austerity. Labour’s £, spending per pupil in  is down to £, under the Cons and children’s education will suffer when a Tory £, target in four years doesn’t even repair the damage. Dismantled red wall Disillusionment will grow in former Labour seats where folk loaned their votes to Johnson, as le worsens instead of improving. Those who didn’t like Corbyn will regret falling for Johnson. Monarchy    The constitutional crisis won’t be Harry and Meghan wanting money and titles without duties, but the FBI deciding to interview paedophile’s pal Prince Andrew. The British monarchy’s fate rests on whatever Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein’s friend Ghislaine Maxwell might tell US law enforcement. From Russia with love We’ll learn how Russian roubles bought the Tories, with the release of an intelligence report that Johnson suppressed before the election. Some £, of £million donated was infor a game of tennis with him. Corbyn was unfairly accused of being soft on the Kremlin over the Salisbury poisoning but follow the money and its from Russia with love to the Tories. Environment  Bans in April will see billion plastic straws, billion plastic cotton buds and million stirrers no longer consumed each year. The Government is more hot air than action, which means Extinction Rebellion will be back on the streets and our planet’s fate is in the hands of a -year-old Swedish schoolgirl, Greta Thunberg.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWith just days left of  drivers need to be aware of all the new driving laws and changes coming into force with the start of the new decade.Several driving laws were passed in between all the Brexit debates, which come into effect on Wednesday, January .And while some of those relate to Brexit itself, there are also changes in accordance with the growing concerns over climate change.There are also a number of safety laws which are being discussed which could impact motorists going forward, My London reports.Low emission rules In April , London got a new Ultra Low Emission Zone , which replaced the previous T-charge scheme. It currently applies to Central London and will be extended to all of inner London in . But in , the policy could be adopted around other parts of the country.  Birmingham will be introducing its own scheme in July and a Leeds scheme was expected to start in January but has been delayed. Other cities interested include Bristol, Cambridge, Cardf, Newcastle, Derby and Edinburgh. If a vehicle doesn’t meet ULEZ emission standards, the driver will have to pay a charge to drive in the defined area. The ban affects older diesel cars more heavily. Car tax Most drivers already saw their vehicle excise duty bill go up by £ in line with inflation this year. But owners of high emission cars will be charged up to an additional £, and diesel car owners whose vehicles fail to meet the new mandatory RDE emissions standard will continue to pay higher tax rates. New car buyers could also face an extra £ on their first yearaposs car tax.  Smart motorways It’s already illegal to drive in a lane closed by a red X sign on a smart motorway. If caught, you could receive a fixed penalty of up to £ and three points. Legislation is being worked on to enforce stronger penalties in certain cases. Highways England is also planning to start building more emergency refuge areas across the smart motorway network, starting with some on the M which has just begun. With the conversion of many hard shoulders into running lanes on smart motorways, the RAC has been leading calls to grow the number of refuge areas to reduce the risk for those who may suffer a breakdown or crash further from a refuge area. Intelligent speed assist Intelligent speed assist is a feature which will become mandatory for the safety of new cars from  under the EU’s revised general safety regulation. The goal is to increase road safety and minimise collisions. It involves cameras which can read and understand road signs and place limits on our enginesapos power so you cannot drive over the speed limit. Other soon-to-be mandatory safety systems include warnings for driver distraction and drowsiness, cameras sensors for reversing, advanced emergency braking, lane keeping assistance and a black box data recorder for incident reporting.  Driving permits and green cards Brexit is still a bit of a minefield so many years on from the referendum and it is still possible we could leave without a deal. Government guidance tells Brits their current driving licences will be useless on the continent in a no-deal scenario. If you’re planning to drive in the EU as a holidaymaker or visitor, you will have to spend £. on an international permitwe leave without a deal. This will be available to purchase from Post Office. You will also need to carry a motor insurance green card when driving your own car in the EU and EEA. You can get one of these by contacting your insurance provider a month before you travel. Parking surcharges and new legislation A pavement parking ban has been in place in London since , however there could be new legislation introduced that would see restrictions extended across England. There is some opposition to this so it may take time to work its way into a law. Meanwhile the RAC has been leading the charge to implement a new code of practice that will help protect drivers from unscrupulous parking companies by banning certain practices and create a single, independent appeals process throughout England. Nearly , people approached the Citizens Advice Bureau for guidance on parking tickets last year. The latest is that new legislation has been passed but the working group is yet to conclude new code of practice. Recently qualied drivers Recently qualied drivers could also face changes once they have passed, with the government even considering bringing in a graduated driving licence. Currently, new drivers who have been behind the wheel for less than two years face stronger penalties for offences like using a mobile phone. However, a whole range of restrictions could also be imposed. The RAC believes these are likely to focus on:Curfews - Times when they are allowed to be on the road Passengers - Limits for how many passengers a new driver can have Speed - Separate, lower speed limits to other drivers Engine sizes - Limits on how powerful their cars can be Mandatory P plates - These are currently optional, but could be made mandatory for up to two years Alcohol - Lower limits than the general driving populationA pilot scheme for graduated licences was tested in Northern Ireland from  to . This could lead to it being rolled out in Englandsuccessful.  Overtaking cyclists People may soon be encouraged to use the Dutch reach when opening their car doors. That means rather than using your hand closest to the door, you use your far hand to reach the handle, allowing you to look out of the window and ensure you donapost hit a passing cyclist. Drivers will also be instructed to give way to cyclists and pedestrians when turning left, to provide some clarity to the current Highway Code. Some road safety campaigners have said the code does not do enough to explain how drivers should treat cyclists on the road. Driving lessons on motorways For years, it was the law new drivers could only use motorways once they had already passed their driving test. They are now allowed to use them as part of a lesson when they are accompanied by an instructor with dual controls in the car. However, this is only optional - it isnapost compulsory for learners to have lessons on them. New MOT rules There are new categories for defects with cars which drivers will have to understand, which are:Dangerous - Direct risk to road safety or the environment. Results in a fail. Major - Could affect safety or the environment. Results in a fail. Minor - No effect on safety, but should be repaired as soon as possible. Advisory - Could have an effect in future. Pass - Meets the current legal standards."},{"url":null,"title":"food bank promotes reverse advent","story":"NewsFood bank promotes reverse advent calendar for January to encourage donationsThe Bedford Food bank says January is a \"bleak month\" for food donations as people have spent their cash during the festive period, leaving food banks struggling to help those in needShareCommentsByLila Randall:,  DEC NewsThe Bedford Foodbank says donations are sparse throughout January \" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - politicsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

The Bedford Foodbank asked people to save an item each day in December to donate after Christmas when the general public have tightened their purse strings. Sarah Broughton, project manager, said January could be a “bleak month” as many people had spent their money during the festive period. She said: People are so generous up to Christmas, but donations drop off into the New Year, which is understandable.

The Art BB’s misshapen room features a bed with high sides to block access, a toilet door that obstructs the use of the sink and a TV that’s only watchable by looking in the mirror. The nightmare room in Blackpool opened earlier this month andthe mentioned annoyances are not enough to put you off then maybe the bathroom light being behind the shower-head, the curtains not covering the window, the lopsided shelves and the randomly dotted light switches will. It was designed by Leicester-based artist Christopher Samuel who wanted to show people how dficult it is to be disabled and to be placed in accommodation not suitable for a guests needs. It is run by Michael Trainor, from Manchester. He said: Every element of the room is in place to infuriate the guests, you have to hop over the toilet and stand behind the door to use the sink leaving about a foots worth of space. Even using the shower is a nightmare, the soap and shampoo bottles are set upside down so it’s hard to get it out. The building process was a little wonky too. He added: “The builders didn’t understand what was going on, they kept pulling us to one side and telling us the designs were all wrong and the measurements did not add up. “I suppose they’re not used to people telling them that being wrong is exactly how it is supposed to be and were quite baffled by it - we all had a good laugh when seeing the final product.”  Mr Samuel was chosen to design one of the  rooms in the community-funded hotel. The original plan was borne out of his experience of being homeless in , when he was placed in temporary accommodation that had poor access.  Speaking about his experience, he, said: “I couldn’t enter the room normally, use the toilet or even get on the bed, so I just slept on my chair. “I’m really pleased with the room, I think it brings some genuine understanding to people about the dficulties of being disabled in everyday situations.”  Michael added: “We have had a few bookings for this room since we opened last month, people enjoy the idea of it and understand why the room is how it is. “We always let customers know a bit about it but we hide most of the information so it hits them whilst using the room just how annoying it is.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kate middletons regret over christmas","story":"NewsKate Middletons regret over Christmas Day outfit telling fan I really shouldnt have worn thisKate Middleton looked gorgeous in a heavy grey Catherine Walker coat, matching her accessories with Princess Charlotte, but she wishes she opted for something  for the Christmas Day celebrationsShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video british-royals-arrive-buckingham-palace-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news kate-middletons-regret-over-christmas-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - Royal FamilySubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

The -year-old man, who is anonymous, only alerted medics to his skin problem after the “enormous” ‘cutaneous horn’ grew to cm inand .cm in width. Medics at the Countess of Chester Hospital were stunned to find that despite the slow growth of the tumour, the cancer hadn’t spread to any other part of the patient’s body, despite the fact he’d never received treatment. The tumour was removed under general anaesthetic, and the large hole was sealed using a skin graft from his thigh. The British Medical Journal reported the man was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma , and while the cancer can be aggressive it is not usually le-threatening. They wrote: “We report a rare case of an extremely large well-dferentiated SCC that was neglected by a patient living in a developed country with access to free healthcare. “This highlights that despite current public skin cancer awareness and rigorous healthcare measures, cases like this can still arise and slip through the net.” Usually, SCC begins as a firm pink lump with a crusted surface. A lot of surface scale covers the area and sometimes a spiky horn develops. The lump is often tender to touch, bleeds easily and may develop into an ulcer. It is unclear why a horn can develop, but the odd formations often appear on the face or ears.

The Duchess of Sussex’s mum Doria, , is joining the royal trio – along with a royal protection team, who are staying in a cottage in the grounds. The property is believed to be owned by a powerful Russian businessman who is so secretive that he insisted the estate agent handling his purchase sign a non-disclosure agreement. And it has everything a modern royal could desire – the gourmet kitchen is fitted with a top-of-the-range pizza oven, perfect for Harry, who has spoken of his love for a deep dish and thin crust. One local, who runs a deli close to the sprawling home in British Columbia, told the Sunday Mirror: “We know that it’s owned by a Russian businessman, but he’s never around.” Another told us: “It’s an incredible property, and one of the most prestigious around here. “I wasn’t surprised when I found out Harry and Meghan are staying there. It’s certainly fit for royalty.” The Sunday Mirror has decided not to reveal the location of the royal couple’s holiday home. Built just over a decade ago in several acres of manicured grounds, the estate was described by one previous visitor as “a sanctuary” rather than simply a home.The rooms of the main house alone cover more than , sq ft – almost half as big again as Love Island’s summer complex on Majorca. As well as a wealth of opulent bedrooms, multiple bathrooms and a formal dining room, it has a games room with wet bar, a media room and even a wine-tasting room. The two-storey living room has spectacular sunset views looking across a magnicent stretch of water. And despite being relatively new, there is even a th century French fireplace imported specially from Europe. The guest cottage in the grounds adds more than , sq ft of indoor space, and there is also a luxury summer house. The Duke and Duchess, celebrating seven-month-old Archie’s first Christmas, are understood to have arrived at the property  days ago and are expected to stay until Friday.The region on Canada’s west coast was a favourite of Harry’s mother, Princess Diana, who admired its rugged beauty. But despite their luxury accommodation, Harry, , and Meghan, , ate out on Christmas Day – taking a private suite at a nearby VIP resort, with caterers they hired just for the day. An insider at the upmarket retreat, where the eco-conscious couple were seen arriving in a parade of xs, said: “The high-end caterers were called in to supply the lunch, which included vegetarian options, right at the last minute. “There were  to  people in the suite, including their security detail. A fleet of SUVs was outside the resort, which the group had used, including Range Rovers.  “And as well as security from England, there were also members of the Royal ­Canadian Mounted Police there too.” The couple’s British security detail for the trip is paid for by the taxpayer. The source revealed that, during the lunch, talk had turned to how the group should go for afternoon tea at a hotel once visited by both Harry’s father, Prince Charles, and his grandmother, the Queen. The source added: “Harry and Meghan laughed about it. They wanted to go there, but it was thought to be too public at this time of year.” The couple had needed to change their Christmas Day plans at short notice after another restaurant turned down their reservation due to the tight security required.  And while Prince William, Kate and their eldest children George, six, and Charlotte, four, greeted crowds at Sandringham on Christmas Day along with other Royals, Harry and Meghan were instead spotted taking Archie for a quiet family stroll in nearby parkland. A dog walker who passed them said: “I saw them on one of the trails. They were with three security men. I saw the security men first – I just thought to myself how unusual it was.” It is unclear who footed the bill for the Christmas Day lunch, or who is paying for the couple’s luxury stay – estimated to cost as much as £, a month.

A spokeswoman for Winchester College said that acceptance of a bequest of this nature would neither be in the interests of the school as a charity nor the specic interests of those it aims to support through its work. Sir Bryan wanted to help white boys from disadvantaged backgrounds because they perform worse at school than their counterparts from other ethnic groups, according to the newspaper.Scholarships for black students to attend Cambridge University are funded by the rapper Stormzy. Sir Bryan told The Times : If Cambridge University can accept a much larger donation in support of black students, why cannot I do the same for under-privileged white British Winchester said it would harm its reputation by accepting my bequest, but in my opinion it would gain enormously by being seen to address what is the severe national problem of the underperforming white cohort in schools.

Those in the southern half will have to keep their fingers crossed that the cloud and rain expected during the day clears in time for midnight as forecast. Crowds of people are gearing up to attend fireworks displays throughout the UK to ring in the new year, including cities such as Manchester and Liverpool. People heading to watch the Mayor of Londonaposs annual fireworks display in the capital will face temperatures of about C, while revellers in Edinburgh and Glasgow can expect the mercury to dip to about C. Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill warned it would be a chilly end to , despite the recent mild temperatures. There will be a bit of a north-south split to the weather, he said. It will stay largely clear in the north, and the cloud and rain in the south should clear up. You will need a coat and take precautions because of possible fog in the early hours. It comes after a balmy night in the north of Scotland on Sunday morning when a Met Office observation post in Cassley, Sutherland, recorded a temperature of .C at am - a UK record for that late in December. The average temperature for that area in December is zero degrees at night.  Meteorologists put the record down to a weather process called the Foehn effect. Describing it as pretty exceptional, Mr Burkill said: We have never recorded a temperature that high this late in the month. What makes it more unusual was the temperature came at am. It was still short of the record for December, however, which stands at .C recorded on December   in Achnashellach, in the Highlands of Scotland.  In the UK, the most notable Foehn events tend to occur across the Scottish Highlands where the moist prevailing westerly winds encounter high ground along Scotlandaposs west coast. This results in a marked contrast in weather conditions across the country with the west being subjected to wet weather, while the lower lying east enjoys the warmth and sunshine of the Foehn effect. Overnight on Saturday into Sunday, mild air from Africa pushed across the UK. As the air travelled from the south west over the UK, it rose up and lost its moisture. This meant that the other side of the hills ended up with drier air.

They met every week during their pregnancies, attended each otheraposs baby showers and even shared updates during their labours. Now they want to help other women struggling to conceive. We wanted to be at each otheraposs baby showers, we wanted our bump pictures, we wanted to be there for each other. We would chat about our symptoms and ask for advice, Amie, , said. To be able to share those feelings with four women who completely understood was amazing. The school counsellor, who became mum to Penelope in May , met her pals at a fertility clinic run by the Reproductive Medicine Associates of New Jersey . Doctors there had told Amie that her best chance for a baby would be with IVF after a sample showed her husband Philip, , a teacher, had abnormally shaped sperm. Amie added: It was really hard, I was really stressed. People donapost know the terms - like follicles and lining. It was hard even to talk to friends who werenapost going through fertility problems. It is exhausting to explain it all. As soon as I walked into the room, I thought: wow, these other women have gone through hard times. I was overwhelmed with emotion but also relief.  Celeste, a -year-old music teacher, of Martinsville, New Jersey, mum to Annarose, had been trying to have children with her husband John, , also a music teacher, for three years when she walked into the group in October . Earlier that year, she had suffered the agony of losing twins - Robin at seven weeks and Rosa at  weeks. Celeste said: Just being at the group helped. The other people were understanding and knew what I was going through without me going into the whole backstory. As much as my friends wanted to support me, they often didnapost know what to say.  It was nice to go somewhere where they understood why Motheraposs Day made me sad. The dficulty of IVF is not just the needles, the needles are not even the hard part, itaposs the emotional side of things that is really dficult.The other four ladies and I started a Facebook messenger chat and soon we were seeing each other all the time.Micki, , mother to Colton and Emma, struggled to conceive after she was diagnosed with Gravesapos disease, an autoimmune disease which can make periods irregular, and was also diagnosed with diminished oian reserve. The part-time behavioral analyst for children with autism, of Somerset, New Jersey, said the womenaposs positivity helped her remain hopeful when she doubtedshe and husband, Lance, , a technology salesman, would ever become parents. I kept coming back month after month, she recalled. Celeste, Kristen, Kristin and Amie were the most positive and supportive women in the group. We tried to help each other find the silver lining and buoyed each otheraposs spirits when things didnapost go according to plan. We spoke about the medical stuff and the emotional stuff, how dficult it was to see other women pregnant and the anxiety of celebrating holidays when your family isnapost what you want it to be. Kristin, a project manager at an accounting firm, of Denville, New Jersey, found herself at the group because her husband Greg Matty, , a sales rep for a meat company, had a low sperm count after undergoing radiation treatment for testicular cancer.  The mum to Layla said: Greg was a chef at the time and working late hours and I felt so helpless. I felt odd about going to the group at first because I knew most of the women were there because of reproductive issues. But even though I have working eggs, I couldnapost have kids with my husband without the help of a doctor. I felt instantly connected. The group would end after one hour and we would stay and talk. We had so much to talk about. Quickly we all started meeting up outside of the group. We wanted to get together more often and we began grabbing dinner before the group. When you are going through infertility, it consumes your whole le. It is all you think about. You keep thinking about how you are going to have a kid, when you are going to have a kid,youaposll ever have a kid. We were all going through the same thing - thataposs how our bond formed.  Kristen, -year-old mom to Adam and Mason was going through IVF without a partner and appreciated the support of Kristin, Amie, Micki and Celeste. The teacher, of Bedminster, New Jersey, said: When I was turning  and I was single, I decided to pursue becoming a mother on my own and that was what brought me to RMANJ. Everyone was really accepting and I didnapost feel out of place at all. It was a dferent circumstance that brought me there. I didnapost think the odds were in our favor that all five of us would have babies. My fear was that one of us wouldnapost become a mother. We just hoped and prayed that it would work for all of us and by some miracle it did.  Celeste fell pregnant first - in June . Weeks later Kristen discovered she was also pregnant and a fortnight after that, Amie, Kristin and Micki also found out they were expecting. Celeste admitted she was nervous when she realised she and the other four women were pregnant. She said: Iaposve heard that one in four pregnancies result in a loss and from a mathematic perspective, I was nervous. There were five of us in the group and I didnapost want anyone to be left out or deal with the devastation of a miscarriage. Each step of the way we celebrated with each other. We were crossing fingers and saying prayers, keeping each other occupied, we were really rooting for each other.  The women graduated from the group and soon started taking prenatal yoga classes together as well as sharing every detail of their pregnancy in their group chat. Kristin said: We graduated from the group and all we talked about was our pregnancy, we went to yoga together, we attended each otheraposs baby showers, we spoke about our aches and pains. Kristin, Kristen, Celeste and Amie even threw Micki a surprise baby shower in April . I wasnapost going to have a baby shower but the girls surprised me with one, Micki remembered. It was at Celesteaposs house. I thought we were just going to hang out and do some crafts but they threw a little shower for me. It was just the five of us.  In February , Celeste gave birth to little Annarose. Kristen was next when her baby boy Adam arrived on April . The last three babies arrived within a week of each other when Kristin gave birth to Layla on May , Amie had Penelope on May  and Mickiaposs son Colton was born on May  . Micki recalled: We were all updating each other as we were in labour. We were sharing pictures as soon as the baby was born and we were all on baby watch when we were due. We got all the newborns together for a mommy and me class. The group still see each other regularly and have no doubt that little Annarose, Adam, Layla, Penelope and Colton will grow up to be firm friends.

Tamara Bender travels the USA with her husband, Jeremy and a team of helpers tackling homes that are full to the brim with rubbish. Tamara, , who keeps her own home in pristine condition, said the discovery of the cats was one of the worst cases of hoarding sheaposs ever seen. The animals were hidden beneath mounds of rubbish in the home in Arizona, which she then transformed to its former glory. The mum of seven said: The same property had five other sheds on it and another mobile home that were all the same, stuff piled literally to the ceiling. You have to mentally prepare and take a break or go shopping to try and forget about what youaposve seen. The lady with all the cats appeared not to know they were there but some were pretty obvious. We love what we do. We always say that we get paid twice, at the end itaposs rewarding to see weaposve changed their le, we can really see a dference. We have to form an assembly line and pass items back one by one until we can all fit into the room. If the owner works with us then we sit them down and bring them stuff one at a time so they can decide whether to keep it, donate or bin it. In total, Tamara claims there were more than  cats in the property, including  deceased animals and three litters of kittens.  After rescuing the remaining living cats and taking them to a local sanctuary, Tamara and Jeremy adopted one of the survivors, Simon. Tamara and Jeremy from Columbus, Ohio, set up their cleaning business, Help for Hoarders,  years ago after discovering one of their family members was a secret hoarder. Since then, the couple have tackled thousands of homes up and down the country, full to bursting with possessions that their owners find dficult to let go. Now their teenage daughter Callie works in their business too. Tamara said: A relative had a hoarding issue, and no one knew about it until she got sick. We looked around for estimates to get help clearing out the house but there was no one. She felt judged, so we just did it ourselves and it turned into a business. In another extreme case of hoarding, the couple had to cut open the roof of a hoarderaposs motor home because they couldnapost fit inside to empty it. Tamara said the most frequent motive for hoarding is to avoid wasting things that could have value and often people who hoard believe an object could still be usable or might be of interest to someone . She said the worst homes can take up to two weeks, with a team of  crew members and  skips to clear out the property. Tamara said: In the beginning it may have had a legitimate underlying motive of waste not want not but as time goes on it becomes an obsessive compulsive behaviour and a person becomes obsessed with not throwing anything away.  Some hoarders have trouble letting go, some are afraid to ask for help and need the motivation to get rid of things. I havenapost met a hoarder who wanted to live like that. It affects their mental health. Most of the time thereaposs a trauma or tragedy in their le that has caused them depression.

The -year-old claims he foresaw earthquakes in China and Cuba, a mass London cabbie protest, a fire at a large historical church and a scandal involving a public figure named Justin - all of which came true. And now, as we prepare to begin a new decade, Nicolas has shared his predictions for  - and itaposs going to be quite a yearheaposs correct. Nicolas, from south London, has been sensing spirits and experiencing supernatural visions since he was a child, and believes he has led past lives as an Egyptian queen and a lion. Nicolas, who works as a past le regression therapist and hypnotherapist, said: “Some of the visions I have are through dreams, and others just hit when I am walking around. “The dreams are the strongest, though, as that’s when you are conked out. The logical side of your brain is switched off, giving more room to your intuitive side.” Explaining some of the predictions that have come to him, he said: “I’ve seen lots of visions of protests – people taking to the streets, not so much just here, but all over the world.  “Of course, people protest all the time, but I’m seeing this more as a global mass movement. “I also feel Trump will be defeated, although he won’t go quietly and have seen visions of severe weather and very heavy winds in the UK.” Nicolas has also had a number of visions relating to the world of showbiz.  He continued: “I’ve had visions of Paris Hilton announcing she is having a baby, a scandal around Lindsay Lohan and Jenner Aniston starting a signicant new relationship. “I’ve also suddenly become very aware of Amy Winehouse, so I wonderthere will be another death of a young female singer in the headlines, perhaps of something surrounding alcohol and addiction. “This one is really bizarre and random, but I’ve seen visions of a floral cupcake dress going viral, and people really sitting up and noticing the design.” Some other notable visions Nicolas has had, which he believes may end up relating to stories that hit the news, include a large fire at a UK hospital, a dog winning a talent show and England enjoying success at a major football tournament – possibly the UEFA Euro tournament, which begins in June. “I don’t follow football, but I can see England doing well in a really big match,” he said.  Over the years, Nicolas believes his visions have helped him predict major world events before they happen. Speaking at the end of  about his forecast for the year ahead, he mentioned seeing earthquakes in China and Cuba, a mass London cabbie protest, a scandal involving a public figure named Justin and singer Taylor Swt getting engaged. “When I look back at , the things I said at the start compared with events that happened throughout are quite eye-opening,” he said. “For example, on June , months after my vision, there was a severe earthquake in Southern China where  people died. “I also talked about cabbies protesting, which they did in the spring at Parliament Square in London. “I’d had visions of someone called Justin getting caught up in a scandal. At the time I wonderedit could be Bieber or Timberlake – but could that have been Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, who was criticised when a picture emerged of him dressed in a turban wearing black makeup .  “With Taylor Swt, there have been rumours swirling since August time so this one is still a waiting game to seeit is true or not. “Earlier this year, I also had a dream where a church was ablaze. It didn’t make sense to me at the time – I just thought it was a random dream so didn’t pay much attention to it. “But about six weeks later, Notre Dame in Paris burnt down. I’d never been there or seen it up close, but when I saw it on the news, I remembered my dream. It felt very surreal, almost like de ja vu.” Nicolas explained how he has possessed a mystic gt ever since he was a child, and would sense his father, who tragically died when he was a baby, nearby. Then, aged , he realised just how powerful his abilities were following an unexplainable experience he had while in a trance-like meditative state. He recalled: “I had this almost out-of-body experience and I was able to see several of my past lives.  “I’d never even thought about them before, and I still can’t explain it to this day. There’s no logic to it, but I knew what I was seeing was me in a previous le. I saw myself as a man, woman, and even an animal.” So moved was Nicolas by the experience that it convinced him to change his path in le, scrapping his plans to study history and economics at university and training instead as a past le regression therapist. “I’ve had thousands of past lives. I’ve been an Egyptian queen, a maid, a teacher in the French revolution, a deer, a lion and even lived in another universe,” he added. Despite his remarkable predictions, Nicolas’ insists he is “not special” – instead believing that all of us possess the same abilities, but that scepticism prevents us from trusting them.

occasion","story":"A north-east bar and nightclub won#t be allowed to stay open late on Hogmanay as councillors have said its #not a special occasion#.The Caley bar and Cube Club in Peterhead had applied for extended opening hours.Previously the venue had been one of the only places in Scotland to remain open from New Year#s Eve into the early hours of January .The bar and nightclub have been granted late opening for the last nine years, with the venue also acting as an indoor queuing and taxi waiting area.According to owners Carl and Robin Hansen, there have been no issues during their time.Seasonal hours granted during the license change mean Cube nightclub will be open to am and the Caley Bar open to .am on New Year’s Day – the limits for both types of premises under festive hours.But to improve the service, space use and customer experience, the couple applied to keep the bar open to am.The application came before Aberdeenshire Council’s North Licensing Board which has the discretion to grant extended hours for “a special event of local or national signicance”.Speaking to the Press and Journal, Mr Hansen said: “At the meeting, one of the councillors was preparing to approve the hours but was told Hogmanay didn’t meet the legal test as it wasn’t a special occasion.“We think it’s a nonsense response as we’ve spoken to police and others and no one agrees with the decision.“Apparently, because it happens every year, Hogmanay cannot be classed as a special occasion of local or national importance.“This is a prime example of the sort of decision that is holding our town back as they’ve clearly not thought about the needs of the businesses or the people of Peterhead.”A motion put forward by Anne Stirling seconded by Alastair Forsyth refusing the hours extension was agreed on “majority vote”.The reasoning for the rejection was that the application did not meet the legal test as it “did not relate to a special event or occasion to be catered on the premises, nor did it relate to a special event of local or national signicance”.A spokesman for Aberdeenshire Council confirmed that the application was refused at the meeting.He added: “Because the applicant will be getting a letter with the details of the refusal, we are unable to make further comment.”"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Reduction in CO by reforestation in the th century was comparable to just two years worth of fossil fuel emissions today.*A Koch et al.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed. At first I thought it was a dog on the road until my headlights picked him up.Tom Cullen, Dunskeig, Ardfern.We would like to invite readers to nominate a deserving carer for a chance of going on a free holiday, while the person they care for comes on a free break with us, Revitalise, through our new Grace Award for Caring.Carers save the economy £ billion per year, which is more than the NHS budget.

Freddie Paterson came forward to take the penalty but put his shot past the post.The game started flowing from end to end and Freddie Paterson made amends for his earlier miss when he found the back of the net on  minutes.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"no need for stress shop local in festive lochgilphead","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNow there is need to rush out on your lunch break, or even break your neck heading into town before the Big Day # Lochgilphead retailers are opening late, so you can relax while getting your Christmas shopping finished.A #shop local# initiative is being promoted around town, encouraging shoppers to support local businesses by purchasing their Christmas gts and festive feasts locally.On Thursday December  many of Lochgilphead#s shops will be open late, including The Square Peg Marmalade Deli Danny#s Ironmongers Fyne Tackle Argyll Book Centre Breagha R  S Stovecraft Love Dove Studio The Sweetie Jar West Coast Home Fyne Living Bluestone Argyll Pharmacy Mary#s Meals Argyll Gt Company The Archway D  D Wool and Crafts and The Mail Box, including the post office, will also be offering the usual postal servicesyou have any gts still to send off.Rumour has it that some shops will also be offering festive nibbles and drinks, plus promotional offers and discounts."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 5 the nineteenth hole","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWelcome to Episode Season  Finale # Join presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre for more golfing chat about Bob and other golfing fun # with additional material from David McPhee, Bruce McNab, Neil Armour, and Charles Spreadburry.This week they discuss more golfing terminology, look at some stats and even answer a listener#s question.You can listen and or download all Episodes of The BOBcast below"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 13 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsNever mind the general election, with its deep isions and rancour, let alone the circumstances which brought it about.

Most made the measure and on average spurs hit the -cm mark with a couple of decent ones coming in at cm tipping the scales at lbs oz.As the day progressed the weather deteriorated with heavy showers, hail and really strong gusts spinning the boat leading to the inevitable Etive tangles.A decision was made to cut the day short and lines up was called at pm.Given the conditions everyone coped well and at the end of the day four species, spurs, whiting, lsd and pouting, added to the tally of  counting fish.Highlight of the day were the two sea eagles that flew in quite close on the hunt for food but they had their work cut out with so many greedy gulls around. Food wasn’t an issue for the boys though with homemade soup, tablet, shortbread and ginger wine all hitting the spot.Back ashore and the scores tallied up, the winner of this year’s Christmas Shield was Gordon Law with Robert MacBrayne in second place.

just two years.Persecution of the iconic birds as well as changes in land use had led to numbers dropping across the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway in recent decades.Ahead of the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project being launched almost two years ago it was believed that there were only two-to-four breeding pairs left across the whole area.Conservationists had identied enough habitat spread across the two rural local authority regions to comfortably cater for as many as  birds.Eaglets were taken from nests in the north of Scotland by ornithologists to prepare for release in the south.In early  five custom built aviaries were constructed in the Southern Upland hills to allow the first of the eaglets to become accustomed to the new territory.While the work of bringing a new generation of golden eagles to the Borders continued, outreach officers staged school and community visits to provide education on the endangered species.This month, with four eagles now successfully introduced to the south of Scotland, bosses at the project revealed that , people have now supported their work by either volunteering or taking part in the outreach sessions.Philip Munro, community outreach officer for the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project, told us: ldquoIt is fantastic to see so many people are so passionate about protecting this iconic species in the south of Scotland.\"We are absolutely delighted with the support, which plays an absolutely vital role in protecting golden eagles.\"We need to keep building on this so that we can ensure that we can see even more of these magnicent birds across the south of Scotlandrsquos skies for generations to come.Funded by Heritage Lottery and LEADER Scottish Borders and DG, the project aims to bring together all countryside users to ensure the wellbeing and successful future of the eagles in the south of Scotland and to secure its place for the future.Those who have participated in the initiative, ranging from four-years-old up to , come from a range of backgrounds and organisations, including the UKrsquos first ever Golden Eagle Scout Champions at the Scottish Borders Scouts, over  pupils from primary schools across the south of Scotland and one in the Scottish Highlands, Borders College, the Scottish Raptor Study Group, Kielder Bird of Prey Centre, HMP Dumfries, and local businesses like Wild Tree Adventures.Earlier this year, the Philiphaugh Estate near Selkirk also announced that it plans to open a Golden Eagle Centre which will support the projectrsquos conservation and community engagement work.Francesca Osowska, Scottish Natural Heritagersquos chief executive, said: ldquoThis is a fantastic milestone.\"Golden eagles are such an amazing part of Scotlandrsquos bioersity, and an integral part of building a nature-rich country for us all.\"Wersquore passionate about ing golden eagles to places where they used to be plentul ndash and it looks like we have thousands of people on our side!\"A huge thank you to all the wonderful volunteers and project participants.The first four birds which were moved to the area have settled into their new habitats and are now fending for themselves.Support from volunteers and participants plays a pivotal role in helping the iconic species continue to grow and thrive in the area.One volunteer was shortlisted as Student of the Year by the Scottish Rural College, largely for her work on the project.Charlotte Martin, a Countryside Management student at SRUC, first heard about the Project when Philip Munro delivered a talk at the college.She said: ldquoHaving previously worked in areas where golden eagles were part of the fabric of the area and very much accepted and admired, alongside my career in farming with employers who farmed commercially yet with great respect for wildle, I was very excited by the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos aims.\"I badgered the project team to let me volunteer and have since been helping at public engagement events, which I thoroughly enjoy.As well as colleges, the outreach team have also visited many schools across the Borders.Michelle Hoppeacute, principal teacher for Yarrow  Kirkhope Primary Schools, said: ldquoWe were really excited to be one of the first schools to take part in the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos Eagle Schools initiative.\"It really brought our community together and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone.\"The children have had the most amazing experience.\"We are incredibly proud of the interest our pupils have shown in protecting this majestic and important bird.

A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

It came after representatives of the local industries which discharge their waste effluents into the main sewage system indicated that they would be willing to co-operate in the neutralising of the acids in their effluents.Without neutralising the acid would prove damaging to the pumps envisaged for the new scheme.The motion calling on the council to give the go-ahead on the project was made by Dean of Guild William Stevenson, and seconded by Councillor N. S. McCallum, who said: #I think health comes before money in this respect.#Fears were expressed about the effect the scheme would have on the rates. Councillor Alastair McKinlay said: #It might be that in years to come we, as a council, will be blamed for putting the rates up.#Provost Daniel McKinven said that the efforts made in the past to secure the new sewage system for Campbeltown were #joint efforts#. The Provost said that the council had #done this for the good of Campbeltown# and that they would #see to it# that local labour is employed on the actual scheme.Mr W. P. Scott, the representative at the meeting of Messrs. Crouch and Hogg, the firm of consulting engineers who will be employed on the project, said that the pumping main would probably be laid along under the Low Askomel road.Mr Scott commented that the most expensive part of the scheme will be the actual laying of the pipelines.Hon. Treasurer George Halbert and Town Chamberlain, Mr William B. Allen, calculated that the rates may have to be increased by s d to cover the cost of the scheme. But Mr Halbert pointed out that the increase may be considerably more.The final calculation will not be made until Messrs. Crouch and Hogg supply a final figure for the cost of the scheme.The town will be eligible for a rates support grant.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGOHighland Parish Church ChoirOn Wednesday night the choir of the Highland Parish Church gave a concert in the Kirk Street Hall in aid of the funds of the Women#s Guild.The audience quite filled the hall, and a most enjoyable programme was received with every indication of appreciation.The choir contributed two-part songs which were rendered tunefully and with fine feeling, and the audience responded with particular warmth.The vocal solos by members of the choir were all most successfully rendered.The songs were nicely selected and several singers, heard for the first time, performed with great taste and sweetness.The soloists were Misses Macalpine, L.

There are new players training all the time and I was hoping my performances in the qualiers were going to be enough, so it felt great be selected.’After spending Christmas in Kintyre with his family, Liam can look forward to warmer climes next month, when he and the rest of the squad fine-tune their preparations at a training camp in Dubai, before flying on to South Africa, where Scotland will open their tournament against the cricketing might of Pakistan on January , before facing Bangladesh and Zimbabwe.The top two teams advance to the quarter finals, while the bottom two take part in an eight-team Plate section.Liam, who is the grandson of Douglas McKerral, of Meadows Avenue, said: ‘It’ll be crazy going from Christmastime in the west of Scotland to the Middle East for training in the space of five days, but it’s all really exciting.‘At the tournament itself, we’ll play Pakistan first, who have one player taking wickets in top-level test cricket against the likes of Australia and Sri Lanka, while Bangladesh are the top under-s side in the world.

It is a scary premonition.ldquoYoursquore just getting old, was a recent diagnosis from a family member! It was said with affection, of course, yet the ring of truth gave it an unhelpful sting. Age, of course, is just a number and state of mind and I have much to keep me youthful.What did help was meeting up with an old friend last week. As we sat together sharing memories of our youth and the shenanigans we got up to  years ago, I had a disorientating sense of time. It seemed impossible that so many years had passed since the moments we remembered had taken place. Those moments were so present for us. As another clicheacute says, it was asit was yesterday.We both complimented each other on how young we looked but I think this was because we both saw the younger person underneath the wrapping made by time. Society judges so much by appearance, we all do. But when we meet an old friend, even when we have not been in touch for many years, we see the person we knew, eventhe exterior has changed. As the philosopher Henry David Thoreau once said: ldquoItrsquos not what you look at that matters, itrsquos what you see.Who can say honestly they have not judged someone because of what they look like  I am as guilty as anyone . As I said, we all do it on the bus, in the queue at the supermarket while we wait our turn, everywhere. We glimpse at people, avoiding eye contact, but making immediate judgement on the way they look. Sometimes itrsquos negative, sometimes envious, sometimes positive and admiring but always superficial. And I know, like everyone , I too am likewise judged.Itrsquos a human habit, perhaps a primeval instinct in which we must quickly judge people for our safety. But of course outward appearance gives no clue to someonersquos character and real qualities. We must know something of that person first before we can judge on that.And this means seeing beyond what we look at. And to do this we need eye contact, a smile, a friendly gesture and the exchange of some words. We need to connect to the person inside. And the irony is, while there are more of us than ever sharing ever-bigger spaces, we are ever more disconnected from each other.The truth Irsquove come to realise is that you donrsquot have to be an old friend with someone to see their inner self, you just need to see beyond what appears to you. We have another primeval instinct and that is to detect the warmth of a character. But we cannot do thatwe only see what we look at and make no attempt to connect.My resolution, even before New Year, is to do this more often.

One business owner accused the local authority of trying to ide and confuse people so they did not attend.It comes after the council:Haddington Business Community Partnership had asked the council to postpone the public consultation until the start of the new year because it believes the local authority has breached Scottish Government guidelines stating that consultation exercises should not be launched during local or national election periods.A spokesperson for the council has denied this is the case and insisted it is a normal part of pre-consultation process.Community councillor Pat Lemmon said the decisions of the council were disappointing.She said: ldquoIt does not encourage feelings of trust for everyone working together. The ground rules change by the day.And she said the councilrsquos handling of the proposals had caused major distrust among residents, particularly when it came to the independently produced Haddington Vision document officials use to support their case.She said: ldquoThe Haddington Vision strongly said any changes had to be looked at by all the stakeholders, by everyone concerned, to avoid any ill feeling, to make everyone feel they had been consulted as part of proposed plans.ldquoThe statement made that East Lothian Council hopes to be in a position to implement a decision by March  indicates to me that there appears to be a race on to secure funding for the transportation hub.ldquoIf this is the case, is this the right decision given the strong views for and against any proposed hub in the town and the proposed town centre plans currently being discussed by the steering group ldquoTo have such a meeting so close to Christmas, and the stakeholder consultation at a time when many people are working, seems to me to be a bad decision.ldquoI am very disappointed that such a decision has been made.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council previously confirmed that the drop-in event would run -pm, with a public notice in the Courier of November  confirming that was the case.The event was to give local residents and businesses ldquothe opportunity to discover more about the proposals for a transport hub in Haddington.She said: ldquoThey will also be able to see the progress and history of the project to date, including the consideration of  dferent sites across the town.ldquoComments can be recorded as part of this consultation which will help inform the future development of the proposal and will be followed by another consultation in the New Year.However, the public section of the event has been reduced to just  minutes.When asked why the format of the event had been changed, the spokeswoman said: ldquoDue to a combination of level of interest and availability of staff, a stakeholders meeting will be held at pm and invitees include local business owners, schools, community council, sports clubs, transport companies and accessibility and active travel interests. [The] public event will start at pm.Other sites considered for the car park and dropped for ldquoious reasons include the field between West Road, Park Lane, Pencaitland Road and Letham Drive, and the site of the former Haddington Nursery School Annexe, off Meadowpark, which has also been earmarked for a housing development.The plans for Whittingehame Drive, which were drawn up following a series of closed door meetings, came under fire from a number of Haddington residents.Concerns ranged from the loss of green space on the site, which is beside the townrsquos skate park and G sports pitches, to the potential for accidents with youngsters playing next to the car park.The transport hub, which would include a car park with somewhere between  and  spaces, could also include ldquobus connections, bike hire opportunities and new pathways.According to East Lothian Council, the facility,approved, has ldquothe potential to free up parking spaces in the town for short-stay use, making it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.However, business owners were among those raising concerns about the proposals.George James, who runs the East Lothian TV and Video Repair Centre on High Street, felt that the last-minute changes were an attempt by the council to ide people.He said: ldquoIt is clearly isive and an effort to stop people attending the public consultations.ldquoWe are a local business and have been told we cannot attend the stakeholdersrsquo meeting as we are not considered stakeholders.ldquoWe are encouraging as many people as possible to join a protest at the Town House on Monday evening we are determined to ensure they do not get away with this approach, which appears shambolic.Karla Green from the shop is handing out leaflets advising people about the public meeting but the times have changed so much even her leaflets are now out of date.She said: ldquoThey still have pm on them so we have to tell everyone that the time has changed ndash again.Project consultants WYG will be in attendance on Monday and will have a number of display boards showing the extent of proposals.Council transport officers will also be in the Town House and people will have the opportunity to ask questions.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe public lsquodrop-inrsquo part is now -.pm and it has been extended due to securing availability of key members of the project team being available to answer public questions.ldquoInvitations to the stakeholdersrsquo meeting are for two representatives from a range of organisations involved in business transport in Haddington and confirmed invitees include Haddington Business Community Partnership, Haddington Community Development Trust, East Coast Buses, Prentice

It has also previously been identied that the Coastguard site could potentially provide parking for any new flats in the Assembly Rooms.A metal staircase linking the car park to the adjacent Church Street and the town centre is also included as part of the proposals.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had mixed thoughts on the scheme.She said: ldquoLargely, there is a demand for parking.ldquoHowever, these car parking spaces would require traffic to move past a very small group of cottages that have enjoyed a degree of privacy in effectively a cul-de-sac all the time they have been there.ldquoInitial messages I have had from residents are of horror.ldquoThe prospect is that green space will be tarmacked over and become a pretty signicant car parking lot.The spokeswoman for the local authority highlighted the proposed car park was part of a wider project surrounding parking in the town.She said: ldquoThe project that transportation is considering has nothing to do with the Assembly Rooms but rather a straight forward look at available space to act as long stay and to change Abbeylands parking to short stay.ldquoThe council is currently negotiating with Transport Scotland and Network Rail to increase the capacity of the rail station car park to stop indiscriminate parking on local streets. This site provides an opportunity to add some additional supply into the town to encourage parking behaviour that is more appropriate.Councillor Norman Hampshire, who represents the Dunbar and East Linton ward, was unable to comment on the specics of the proposals as he is convener of the councilrsquos planning committee. But he said but said there was a need to address parking problems in the town.He said: ldquoThe old part of the town, the narrow streets around Church Street and Castle Street, is very congested with the number of cars parked there because of the restrictions on the High Street. Traders and people who work in the premises park on the surrounding streets and they are very congested.There is definitely a need for more parking in the town centre.Councillor Paul McLennan, who also represents the town, is not part of the planning committee and welcomed the possibility of a car park being created.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the

had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authorityrsquos planning committee last Wednesday, the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a ldquobad neighbour.Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rocket engines on the land, which is central to the councilrsquos future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: ldquoThis is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while it applied for temporary use of the site for five years, Skyrora told the planning committee that it envisaged the possibility of not just expanding its presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea store, to the area.And while Prestonpans Community Council supported the move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, neighbouring Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting last week, Bryan Hickman, chairman of Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, recalled a public meeting in the summer which attracted several hundred people.He said: ldquoVirtually everyone who was there was against it ndash ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.ldquoThe feeling, rightly or wrongly, in the community is that they do not want it.During the council meeting, residents raised concerns about the storage of key elements of fuel on the site for days prior to testing, as well as the impact of burning kerosene into the atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision. The community thanks the ward councillors who called in the application.ldquoIf this did not go before the committee, it would have been approved by East Lothian Council planning department.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said that he hoped the council would now turn attention to calls for a cruise port at the former power station site, which has been supported by his members. He said: ldquoI am disappointed that local ward councillors went against the advice of their council officers on this planning application.ldquoHopefully this will focus East Lothian Council councillors and officials on pushing forward the cruise port initiative to secure much-needed jobs in East Lothian.And his community council colleague Mr Miller criticised councillors for failing to listen to their officials.He said: ldquoIt was patently obvious that councillors on the planning committee couldnrsquot get their heads around the nuances of decibels and emissions.ldquoThey should have fallen back on advice from their own experienced officials. Instead, they repeated the junk science coming from cranks in Cockenzie.ldquoEach test would have generated the same emissions as a family car running for a year. The councillors who referenced a climate emergency in defence of their decision were only too happy to drive home from Haddington.ldquoAn ecosystem of space technology companies could have emerged in East Lothian based around the testbed.ldquoThe wilful ignorance of a few has pulled opportunity for the hands of young people in East Lothian.Derek Harris, from Skyrora, said he was disappointed by the decision of the planning committee.It is understood the company will take time to consider whether to appeal the decision.Mr Harris said: ldquoI would like to thank all the staff at East Lothian Council who helped with our application.

My we and kids were with me carrying the crisps and goodies when the absence of sound coming from my friendrsquos flat made me suddenly realise Irsquod mucked up.Turning up on a doorstep with drinks and snacks for a party that had already taken place was a potentially awkward moment.ldquoI wondered where you were yesterday, my friend said, ldquoas you were so sure you were all coming.Kate, my we, who normally keeps me organised, looked at me in a way that expressed horried disbelief and lack of surprise at the same time. But what could have been an embarrassing and disappointing evening became a wonderful and quite moving experience.My friend is Jewish. She is not religious but she observes Jewish festivals and traditions as part of her inheritance and identity. And the day we arrived was December , which in  was the first day of Hanukkah, also called the lsquofestival of lightsrsquo. There is not a fixed date for this celebration as the time is based on the cycle of the moon, as many celebrations from other religious traditions are.We were askedwe would like to take part and we were honoured to do so. By tradition, the youngest in the room lights the candle, so my four-year-old son, with help, did so.The evening was full of meaning and unexpected closeness with an old friend. There was a feeling of shared sacredness in the antiquity of the ceremony, and the meaning of the story behind Hanukkah, like many religious stories, can be interpreted in dferent ways by the people who hold that faith.But at its core is the story of the miracle of the lamp that, despite only having oil enough for one night, burned for eight days and eight nights. The lamp was lit as a dedication to a desecrated temple, thereby signalling the restoration of religious freedom, and hence the name festival of lights.As we left our friendrsquos house into a cold and calm night, Kate told me she had forgiven me, as otherwise we would not have had such a meaningful and memorable evening.It happened to be also the Winter Solstice and this is a turning point in the year. Hanukkah isnrsquot specically about seasonal change but the idea of sharing the light in this dark time is a common theme.I imagined our ancestors huddling together in their ancient dwellings during the shortest day, knowing the dark was now at its worst, and soon the light would begin to . Le would come back to the land and the days become longer. But in the meantime, ways were needed to keep the dark at bay.Today we challenge the darkness with decorative seasonal lights. But we also have super-lit shopping centres, bright street lights and, hopefully, warm and lit homes.But in celebrating this time, it seems the seasonal bling of the corporate money-makers is becoming the new ritual. They promote the idea that celebrating together should be bigger and better every year that those who want to feel included need to buy the ticket for the big event.And indeed, much fun can be had at such events. But have we reached a point where traditions have become marketing labels rather than authentic shared experiences  Some people now have to acquire tickets from a company to celebrate in their own street, although thankfully not yet in East Lothian.The idea of being bigger and better means bigger crowds, which means more profit but not necessarily a better experience. Big crowds need to be restricted and controlled, meaning others are excluded. Have we reached the point whereyou donrsquot have a ticket then you canrsquot be part of the tradition We can enjoy big events while still having our own traditions, of course, but my feeling is that the idea of tradition is being hijacked by a commercial juggernaut with little authenticity or meaning other than making money.And so I think the unexpected evening with my friend taught me a lesson I hope I already knew: that the traditions we really value, and the memories we truly treasure, are the simple ones of shared meaningful connection. And perhaps the biggest treasure is sharing with those who would otherwise be excluded.And so wherever you are, whatever you do, I hope you find time to share these moments at this time of seasonal celebration. Whatever your faith or spirituality, whatever your family or cultural traditions, I wish you a Happy New Year and I look forward to theof the sun, and sharing with you new adventures of discovery in our beautul county."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-youngsters-thank-lifeboat-crew-saving-lives","story":"Rachel Pirie and Luke Foster, both , were exploring the townrsquos clfs with Chloe McCaw, , at about noon on November  last year when the incident happened.The rising water levels left the youngsters, who all live in Dunbar and attend Dunbar Grammar School, cut off with no food, no water and one working mobile phone that did not have any credit.Police and Coastguard crews struggled to locate them.Talking about their ordeal, Rachel said: ldquoWe know the area well and the tide was well out so we thought we were safe.

A number one single across the world from that the guy next door whose music has no bearing on his crazy social media appearances. Blanck Mass - House vs HouseA scream and a percussive rapid-fire vocal sample ushers in this eight-minute house-tinged synth epic and first single from the cracking fourth album of Benjamin John Power, who is also half of electro noise duo F*ck Buttons.

Anna Meredith - Inhale ExhaleLondon-born and Edinburgh-bred composer, performer and producer gave her twist on Vivaldis Four Seasons last year, only to show this year she can create a wonderfully hypnotic synth-pop song and sing on what is an instant highlight from her mercurial FIBS album.The song is underpinned with lyrics exploring a more sinister and pessimistic take on what lsquolivingrsquo or having a lsquowild timersquo might be like for \"a cautious person like myself\".She sings:\"You say yoursquore dancing in the deep end, but to me it looks like drowning\". C Duncan - Talk Talk TalkThe sublime opening track from the third album from the Glasgow musician and the first away from his bedroom studio, also moved him away from his introspective art pop on this, into synth pop gem territory. But typical of the Scot who received a Mercury Prize nomination for his debut album Architect, it remains sounding like nothing  around, with signature layered harmonies and a gorgeous hooksome middle eight.ldquoTalk Talk Talk is about miscommunication.

While Irsquom usually focused on the trail ahead and wide mountain views I also keep half an eye out for interesting plants and fungi, especially on the long, slow uphill section.ldquoI suppose I was secretly hoping for an excuse for a rest so was delighted when I spotted something a little dferent out of the corner of my eye.The naturalist said he had been inspired to find rare lichens by a project run by Kew gardens in London that aims to seek out unusual and undocumented fungi across the UK.There are an estimated . million species of fungi worldwide ndash and possibly millions more ndash but, because of their often remote habitats, gaining information on their whereabouts can be hard.The Kew Gardens scheme is a five-yearlong effort calling on scientists and the public to rediscover lost species, to look for rare ieties, revisit sites known from historical records for a fresh look, and survey plausible locations for new populations.It was with this in mind that Mr Genney managed to spot the crop of Multiclavula corynoides, despite its remote location.He said: ldquoI recognised it because the Kew Lost and Found Fungi project have been encouraging citizen scientists to look out for rare or under-recorded species.ldquoThey had highlighted a related lichen as one of their target species so things like this were on my radar.ldquoItrsquos always exciting to find something yoursquove never seen but for it to be a species that has never been seen in Britain before made my day.ldquoThe discovery fills a gap in our knowledge of the global distribution of this little fungus. Itrsquos also interesting that it was thriving on an old forestry road siding, demonstrating how nature can sometimes benefit from man-made habitats.ldquoIt just shows the importance of keeping your eyes peeled when yoursquore out and about enjoying the outdoors ndash you never know what you might discover.The discovery may be down to next yearrsquos autumn delivering perfect conditions for fungi to bloom.A damp end to the summer and a wet autumn created fertile ground for them, with some species which usually haunt dark corners being seen in the open.Gardeners at the Royal Horticultural Society Gardens and Partner Gardens have reported findings of unusual species, giant specimens and prolerations of ldquofairy rings made of red and white-spotted toadstools."},{"url":null,"title":"people-decade-20-movers-shakers-history-makers","story":"In , Time Magazine named its person of the year as \"the silence breakers\". McGowan was just one of those many women who stepped forward to make accusations about Harvey Weinstein that year. She was there at the beginning of a series or revelations about the producer which would snowball into a global sharing of stories of womens experience of sexual assault and harassment that would be called #MeToo.If anyone became a figurehead, it was McGowan. She may not have come up with the term Me Too ndash that was Tarana Burke back in . Nor was she the person to put the hashtag out into the ocean of social media ndash that was Alyssa Milano, her co-star from Charmed. But she made her mark as someone who would not be silenced. She has also claimed that she was the first person to out Weinstein.#MeToo was a cultural revolution and catharsis. Back in , when it broke, it felt asHollywood and the many fields where men were protected by their power and influence would never be the same again. In this revolution around what women should tolerate, who would be listened to, and what should be shamed, McGowan stood out. She wrote a memoir, Brave. She used her anger as a weapon. In an interview with the Times, she asked, \"Who has been more effective  hellip Playing nice for women hasnt got us very far.\"Weinstein recently complained that he was \"a forgotten man\". With his trial coming up next month ndash five charges, including two counts of rape ndash he might wish he were more forgotten than he is. #MeToo might have experienced backlash and criticism. But out of it did come much that was positive and inspirational, particularly the courage of the women who came forward. McGowan embodies that. Her voice carried the message that the time when abusers could expect silence was over.VICKY ALLANPHOEBE WALLER-BRIDGE, ACTOR, WRITER AND PRODUCERSpeaking to The Herald recently, Scottish actress Ellie Haddington recalled her time working on The Cafe, a Sky One sitcom which aired in . It starred The Royle Familys Ralf Little alongside Haddington and Littles co-writer Michelle Terry. But it was another cast member, then an unknown -year-old actress, who particularly caught Haddingtons eye. \"I can remember looking at her,\" she said, \"and thinking: My God, what an extraordinary inidual.\" The inidual in question was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, in her first major role.Fast forward eight years and the London-born polymath has the world at her feet, particularly the part that houses the gilded constituencies that hand out Emmys and Golden Globes. The  Golden Globe ceremony is on January  in Beverly Hills and Waller-Bridge is up for two awards. Ten days later shell be honoured at the Screen Actors Guild Awards where shes nominated in two categories. Andshe flies home laden with mantelpiece accessories it wont be the first time ndash she scooped three Golden Globes at last years award as well as three Primetime Emmys.If not, well theres the not insignicant matter of the th James Bond film, No Time to Die, to be released in April. Waller-Bridge co-wrote the script and great things are expected. Of coursetheres one production on which Waller-Bridges name is indelibly stamped its Fleabag, written by and starring her as a young Londoner navigating family, work, sex and relationships with brutal honesty and unsettling humour.Starting out as a one-woman show at the Edinburgh Fringe, it was turned into a TV series in  but was dropped quietly onto BBC Three, then only available online. But word-of-mouth is still a powerful tool even in our digital age and by the summer it had been relaunched on BBC Four. The rest is television history: when we look back at this decades television, well be splitting it into pre and post-Fleabag.Even more interestingly, Waller-Bridge followed that triumph with one of the career curve-balls weve now come to expect: an adaptation of Luke Jenningss Villanelle spy novel series. Retitled Killing Eve it was fresh, funny, thrillingly violent and gratuitously fashion-forward, and made a star of lead actress Jodie Comer, whose pink Molly Godard tulle dress became the go-to Halloween costume for hipsters everywhere. And, of course, it hauled in yet more gongs for its writer.:Books of the decade: From Harper Lee and Hilary Mantel to EL JamesWill it be third time lucky with No Time to Die  Dont ever bet against Phoebe Waller-Bridge.BARRY DIDCOCKANDY MURRAY, TENNIS PLAYERSmall, wet, overweight countries should not ndash and usually do not ndash produce tennis superstars. As only those from other small countries can appreciate ndash the Jamaicans and Swiss, perhaps ndash possessing a global sports hero somehow makes your whole nation stand a little taller.Thats exactly what Andy Murray has done for Scotland . Is there any feeling comparable to the buzz of watching Murray play a big match, willing him to win with every demented fibre of your mind and body  I think not.And yet the Dunblane-born champion is not only from Scotland, but very much of his homeland. During the late Noughties, the young, gangly, wild-haired Murray thrilled us with his impressive Wimbledon runs. But as the years went on and he just missed out on a slew of grand slam trophies, many English media outlets and tennis fans took against him, decrying the sweary intensity and dry Scottish banter. This only made Scots love him more, of course.Eventually, with patience, maturity, courage and sheer hard graft came the top honours in tennis ndash the US Open, two Wimbledon singles titles, two Olympic gold medals, the Davis Cup, the coveted world number one spot ndash and global adulation.But as much as he grew as a sportsman, whats equally remarkable about Murray is how he grew as person. Indeed, it is his openness, humanity and humility, the way he speaks out against sexism in tennis, that make him a true hero, loved by his peers and the public, rather than simply respected.A devastating hip injury ndash and subsequent resurfacing operation ndash nearly ended Murrays career, and his recent comeback has been both painful and inspiring to watch.Murray taught Scots to dream big. But the father of three also taught Scots men, in particular, showing your feelings, being true to yourself, makes you a bigger man in every way.MARIANNE TAYLORJEFF BEZOS, AMAZON CEOThe worlds richest man is fond of reminding people that he started Amazon in his garage. A company that is now worth more than pound trillion and employs in the region of , people began with Bezos packing books and taking them to the post office himself.Like Facebooks Mark Zuckerberg and Twitters Jack Dorsey, Bezos grasped early on the potential of the internet. That realisation has had huge consequences. Amazon has transformed shopping, helped hollow out the high street, and led to a fortune for its creator estimated at poundbn.That has allowed him to set up his own space exploration company and buy the Washington Post .Bezoss success cant be gainsayed, but at what cost  Employees have bitterly complained about working conditions, the EU is investigating the company for anti-trust violations and earlier this year it had to scrap plans to build a second headquarters in New York when local politicians questioned why a company making bna month should receive taxpayers cash to move to the city.Oh yes, and it was also revealed that the company had not paid any income tax in the US the previous year. Or the year before that. You dont get to be the richest man in the world by giving anything away, obviously.TEDDY JAMIESONDAVID BOWIE, MUSICIANIn the months after his death at the start of , as Britain voted for Brexit and America voted for Donald Trump, there was a spate of tweets wonderingBowies absence was now one of the reasons why everything was going to hell in a handcart.\"Im not saying that David Bowie was holding the fabric of the universe together, but *gestures broadly at everything*\" tweeted blogger Katie Liewy with tongue firmly in cheek in June that year.Whether his influence actually stretched that far, theres no doubt that culturally this decade was Bowies, in the same way as the s belonged to the Beatles. As Oasis looked to Lennon and McCartney in the mid-s, Bowie became the touchstone for any musician ndash from FKA Twigs to St Vincent ndash in the s who wanted to push the odd boundary.But none of them did it as well as the original, who ed at the start of , after almost a decade in which he had withdrawn from public view. He released a new single, Where Are We Now , on his birthday without any warning. It presaged a new album, The Next Day, and a VA retrospective, David Bowie Is. Three years later he released an album, Blackstar, on his th birthday. Two days later his death was announced. It was ashe was curating his own end.:From the death of Bowie to the rise of grime: The decade in pop musicFor anyone who knew him in the middle of the s the fact that Bowie avoided being a rock n roll casualty must have seemed a miracle given his copious drug intake back then.Instead, he weaned himself off them, created some of the most memorable and potent music of the late th century, reinvented himself as a mainstream pop star in the s, then became an elder statesman who embraced everything from drum n bass to the internet before his final st-century flourish.His is one of the great stories in pop and in  it came to a tragic yet magnicent conclusion.TEDDY JAMIESONELON MUSK, TECHNOLOGY ENTREPRENEURThe chronicles of self-styled maverick billionaire Elon Musk never fail to fascinate. Among his outlandish adventures and madcap musings, we have Elon and the space car Elon and the Thai cave rescue Elon and the dead gorilla novelty rap Elon and his plan to nuke Mars.South African-born Musk first pricked the public consciousness as a technology entrepreneur, investor and engineer in  when, aged , he sold his web software company, Zip, to Compaq for  million .He continued to ascend his field throughout the Noughties, but it is in the last decade that Musk has become a household name for his roles as founder chief engineer designer of SpaceX and the CEO product architect at Tesla.Granted, this is often more down to calamity than plaudits for his innovative work. Such as the cringe-inducing moment during a recent unveiling for the new Tesla Cybertruck when, demonstrating how tough the \"armour glass\" of the windows was to break, they were duly smashed.Or when he referred to British er Vernon Unsworth ndash who helped rescue  Thai boys trapped in a flooded underwater cave in  ndash as \"pedo guy\" on Twitter .Then theres Musks lofty plans to \"nuke Mars\" ndash which he describes as \"a fixer upper of a planet\" ndash suggesting that nuclear bombs should be detonated at its poles to melt the ice caps and allow it to sufficiently heat up for humans to dwell there.And the head-scratching moment when he dropped a track on SoundCloud called RIP Harambe, a heavily auto-tuned song about the Cincinnati Zoo gorilla whose death in  sparked a global outpouring of grief and anger.Sure, Musk sometimes loses credibility due to his more leftfield thinking ndash such as a belief that were all probably living in a giant computer simulation like The Matrix or a Sims-style game controlled by superior beings ndash but there is no denying that hes a clever guy who shouldnt be underestimated.If this is a simulation, we cant wait to see what our overlords get him to do next.SUSAN SWARBRICKMEGHAN MARKLE, DUCHESS OF SUSSEXSurely it wasnt meant to be like this. If you become a fairy tale princess can you not then expect to live happily ever after That hasnt been the case for Meghan Markle. Yes, she had the royal wedding last year attended by the great and the good and the merely famous. Yes, she got a title, a handsome prince and a royal baby . Not what she must have expected growing up a mixed-race kid in Los Angeles.And yet since the wedding there has found herself a constant target of the tabloid press. She recently filed a lawsuit against the Mail on Sunday for publishing a private letter to her estranged father. It also prompted her husband Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, to condemn the medias \"relentless propaganda\" which was, he said, often \"knowingly  and malicious\" in a public statement announcing the legal action.His anger is perhaps understandable given the paparazzis involvement in the death of his mother. \"Every single time I see a camera, every single time I hear a click, every single time I see a flash, it takes me straight back,\" he admitted this year.The Duchess of Sussexs major crime would appear to be that she has \"opinions\". There is a class of media commentator ndash mouthy, reactionary and perhaps most importantly white ndash who is offended by her feminism and likes to moan about the couples \"wokeness\". It has prompted \"the Queen\", or, rather, the TV version of the monarch, Olivia Colman, star of The Crown, to speak out against the critics.:From Leonard Bernsteinrsquos MASS to the GRIT Orchestra, Keith Bruces musical picks of the decade\"I dont know why theyre so mean to a fellow human being,\" Coleman said of the press coverage.Or maybe we simply have to accept there is no such thing as happy ever after.TEDDY JAMIESONGRETA THUNBERG, ENVIRONMENTAL CAMPAIGNER\"My name is Greta,\" a Swedish schoolgirl wrote on her flyers in . \"I am in ninth grade, and I am school-striking for the climate. Since you adults dont give a damn about my future, I wont either.\"Its hard to believe that it has only been just over a year since Thunberg ndash recognised now simply as \"Greta\" to millions ndash made her viral UN speech in Poland, saying, \"You say you love your children above all . And yet you are stealing their future in front of their very eyes.\"Thunberg may only have made her stamp in the final year of the decade, but at just  years old she has done more to provoke an attitude sht on environment than anyone, and she began it by skipping school.Her words and actions have woken millions of schoolchildren, four million of whom went on strike from school on September , as well as adults, to the science-backed threat of the climate emergency. On what is arguably the biggest issue of our time, hers is the voice that has led, upbraiding those in leadership. Margaret Atwood called her the Joan of Arc of environmentalism. Donald Trump told her to \"chill\". Collins Dictionary made \"climate strike\" its word of the year.Why did people listen to her, when others saying the same were ignored  Perhaps because of who she was ndash not an adult, scientist, politician or expert ndash and how she, a teenager with Aspergers Syndrome, delivered her message, politely, yet angrily and without softenings.To the UN General Assembly, in September, she said: \"We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you.\" She has started a powerful movement. The question is whether necessary change will follow. Can we alter the ending of this terrying nightmare  Thunberg dares us to.VICKY ALLANNICOLA STURGEON, FIRST MINISTER OF SCOTLANDBy the time Nicola Sturgeon became Scotlands first female First Minister in , at the age of , she had already been involved in politics for more than a quarter of a century.She joined the SNP in her native Ayrshire ndash then a Labour bastion ndash aged  at the height of the Thatcher years. It was the decisive first step on a journey that would transform not only the young Sturgeon but the fortunes of her party, and, ultimately, the political landscape in Scotland.After becoming an MSP in , Sturgeon, a solicitor by trade, impressed from the outset, serving in two shadow cabinets. In , she was elected deputy party leader to Alex Salmond during his second stint as party leader. The partnership was successful and in  the SNP won a majority at Holyrood, paving the way for s independence referendum.When Salmond resigned as SNP leader and First Minister in the aftermath of the Yes campaigns loss, Sturgeon was the obvious choice to replace him.:From Frozen to  Years a Slave, the best films of the last  yearsThe five years since have seen tumultuous change in UK politics, with Sturgeon growing in stature as politician and stateswoman, both in UK and European terms, even in the eyes of many who do not share her stance on independence. She regularly appears in glossy magazine lists of the worlds most influential women.During the recent General Election campaign her clear opposition to Brexit and impressive performances in TV debates ndash not to mention her lively Twitter feed ndash won her a whole new legion of fans in England, particularly among women. Will Sturgeon lead Scotland to independence in the s  That remains to be seen. Regardless, her place in Scottish history, as politician and role model, is guaranteed.MARIANNE TAYLORBARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATESThings might look dferent now. In , at the end of Barack Obamas second term in office, when commentators looked back at his legacy as president, there was a sense that his achievements were, at best, mixed.True, he had withdrawn US soldiers from Iraq, improved relations with Cuba, reached a nuclear deal with Iran and introduced Obamacare.Set against that, though, he escalated American military involvement in Afghanistan, increased drone strikes in Pakistan, saw wealth and income inequality rocket under his watch. Guantanamo Bay was still in operation when he left office and though he spoke out in favour of gun control he didnt manage to introduce it.Obama could point to Republican obstruction in the House of Congress. Even so there was a whf of missed opportunities about his presidency. Perhaps that was inevitable. In the end a centrist president was never going to live up to the utopian notions so many Americans projected on to him during the  election campaign.And yet, in retrospect, perhaps his achievements are growing. What has been missed over the last four years is his articulacy, eloquence, wit and normality.In part its because he represents the antithesis of what came after. An inarticulate, narcissistic, racist, corrupt old man whose first term has been a skip fire of the vanities ending in a vote for impeachment. Obama for all his failings always felt like he was an adult in the room. Can you say the same of Donald Trump TEDDY JAMIESONKIM KARDASHIAN WEST, REALITY TV STAR AND ENTREPRENEURLove her or loathe her, there is no denying that Kim Kardashian West ripped up the rule book in her rise to becoming a world-famous reality star with a multi-million-dollar business empire and a global fanbase.Having first found peripheral fame as a friend and stylist to heiress Paris Hilton in the early s, Kardashian West gained notoriety after the release of her sex tape with then-boyfriend Ray J in . That same year, the familys reality TV series, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, began airing.While the naysayers reckoned it would be a fleeting  minutes of fame, Kardashian West pulled off a shrewd and unparalleled move: she utilised social media to make herself into a brand. Today, her Midas touch extends across fashion, fragrances and cosmetics to television, books, gaming, and even law and politics. Oh, and she is queen of the selfie.An exaggerated hourglass figure and cartoonishly large backside have become a trademark for Kardashian West, garnering as many ndash and often more ndash column inches as her entrepreneurial ventures.: The best visual arts of the last  years, by Jan Patience and Sarah Urwin JonesIndeed, when Kardashian West posed for a  cover of Paper magazine with her rear bared and oiled up like a Greek wrestler, it saw a new phrase \"break the internet\" coined, referring to the frenzy that the images sparked.That same year, she joined her husband, the rapper Kanye West, for a landmark cover on Vogue magazine. \"There are a lot of firsts,\" Kardashian West said at the time. \"Kanyes the first rapper to be on, Im the first reality person to be on, were the first interracial couple.\"She continues to surprise people. Earlier this year, Kardashian West announced she was following in her late fathers footsteps by studying to become a lawyer .Kardashian West ndash who boasts  million social media followers on Instagram alone ndash seems determined to use her  and stratospheric public profilefor good, visiting US president Donald Trump at the Oval Office last year to discuss justice reform.She successfully lobbied Trump to grant clemency to Alice Johnson, a -year-old woman who spent  years in an Alabama prison, without parole, for a non-violent, first-time drug offence. Johnson was released in  and Kardashian West has vowed to tackle other miscarriage of justices.Her work to date makes for impressive reading. But in the scheme of things, one could argue that Kardashian West is only just getting started. With her husband having announced he intends to run for US president in , a decade from now this might all seem like small fry.SUSAN SWARBRICKSTORMZY, RAPPERWhy is Stormzy one of the most influential public figures of the last decade  There are  people you could ask ndash  black students who were admitted to Cambridge University in . Thats up about  per cent more than the  who started courses in .Not all of it is down to Stormzy, but a lot of it may be. In , the grime artist announced he would be paying the tuition fees and maintenance grants of two black Cambridge students, and this year he said hed be paying for two more. Its called the Stormzy Scholarship and now theyre calling the rise in the number of black students at Cambridge the Stormzy Effect.The question is: can the effect spread  Theres still a huge gap between the chances of going to university in the UKyoure white and well-off and the chances of goingyoure black or youre poor or youre both and some argue universities will have to offer places to poorer students with lower grades to start making a dference. But the good news, thanks to Stormzy, is that black students now make up more than three per cent of new undergrads at Cambridge for the first time.Stormzy has had another effect too, and perhaps its one that will be even more profound. Rappers have traditionally had a bit of an image problem: theyve usually promoted out-of-school activities rather than in-school ones. But Stormzys dferent. \"It sounds corny coming from a rapper,\" he says, \"but I did love learning and I loved studying.\" The Stormzy Effect could inspire many others to feel the same.MARK SMITHSIMONE BILES, GYMNASTOnce in a letime ndashyoure very lucky ndash theres a sporting star who shines so brightly that they eclipse everything that has come before.Step forward Simone Biles. The US gymnasts talent and achievements are such that we humble observers have long since exhausted the superlatives.While the gymternet ndash as the online community of gymnastics fans are known ndash has been abuzz about Biles for years, it was at the Rio  Olympic Games that the rest of the world sat up and took notice.: From Our Ladies of Perpetual Succour to What Girls Are Made of, five standout theatre shows of the decadeBiles, who won four golds and a bronze, found herself repeatedly compared to a raft of male sporting greats asthat is the only way we could comprehend her colossal achievements. \"Im not the next Usain Bolt or Michael Phelps,\" she responded. \"Im the first Simone Biles.\"The -year-old from Texas burst onto the global gymnastics scene in , winning her debut world all-around gold in Antwerp. It is a title that Biles has claimed on four further occasions , alongside a raft of inidual apparatus medals.In October, Biles took her th medal, making her the most decorated gymnast ndash male or female ndash in world championship history .But it is not only in a competition arena that Biles proved herself a gargantuan presence. In January , she released a statement on Twitter confirming that former USA Gymnastics physician Larry Nassar had sexually assaulted her under the guise of medical treatment.Nassar was later sentenced to up to  years in prison after more than  women stood up in court and laid bare their own experiences of sexual abuse in a scandal spanning three decades.Biles and her fellow survivors were awarded the Arthur Ashe Courage Award. At the  US National Championships, she designed and wore a teal leotard ndash a colour used to raise awareness about sexual abuse.A vocal critic of the US Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics for their response to the allegations against Nassar, Biles continues to lobby for better accountability from both governing bodies.She refuses to be defined by what happened. Biless willingness to push the boundaries of her sport remains unabated. At the  US Gymnastics Championships, she stepped out in a crystal-studded leotard bearing her surname above an embroidered image of a goats head.It was a nod to the acronym GOAT, which is shorthand for the Greatest of All Time. Far from being boastful, however, this was Biless tongue-in-cheek \"jab back\" at the \"haters\" .She has the goods to back it up. This year Biles had two gymnastics skills ndash a hugely dficult triple twisting-double somersault in her floor routine and double-double dismount from beam ndash named in her honour after she became the first woman to perform them. Both appear to defy gravity.The Tokyo  Olympic Games loom on the horizon. Simone Biles is far from done yet.SUSAN SWARBRICKABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADIHe was the most wanted terrorist in the world. For more than half of the last decade, no single figure caused more chaos in the Middle East than Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim al-Badri. For that was his real name, even though the world came to know him by his nom de guerre, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.As the decade began al-Baghdadi had already served four years in the sprawling US military detention centre called Camp Bucca, which had detained some of the Iraq Wars most radical jihadists. In political and religious terms he was already a long way from his days as a PhD student of Islamic Studies at university in Baghdad.By , clad in black robes and standing in the pulpit of a mosque in Iraqs second city of Mosul, he was already claiming the title caliph of the Muslim world and leadership of the infamous Islamic Stategroup.Few even then could have imagined the chaos, carnage and suffering that al -Baghdadi, born one of six children in , would wreak on the world.:Books of the decade: From Harper Lee and Hilary Mantel to EL JamesIt would not be until October , , in a raid carried out by US Special Forces, when al-Baghdadi detonated a suicide vest in the Syrian province of Idlib, that the world was rid of his malign presence.\"We killed the last murderous bastard who ran IS, lets go get the next one,\" proclaimed one tough-talking US Republican Senator in the wake of al- Baghdadis death.But in the tunnels and booby traps left behind in cities like Mosul and Raqqa to the mass graves and thousands of faceless, black-clad female followers haunting refugee camps, ISs presence remains palpable along with its new new leader, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi.Many IS fighters now languish in prisons, but thousands more remain at large re-grouping and organising while their franchises likewise operate across the globe. This is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadis lingering and still menacing legacy.DAVID PRATT, CONTRIBUTING FOREIGN EDITORBOB SERVANT, BURGER TYCOONAh, Bob Servant. How do we love thee  Let us count the ways.

Public opinion has become ever more supportive. LGBT people have become ever more visible. And in , gay marriage was made legal in most of the UK.Then theres the T in LGBT. A few days ago, the Scottish Government published a draft bill which will simply the process of trans men and women having their gender legally recognised, but its not been an easy path. Some feminists say the legislation will undermine the rights of women. Trans activists say a change in the law is the only way to end the demeaning legal and medical process trans people currently have to endure. The two sides have not always been nice to each other.What the debate, and the bitterness, may prove is there is still some distance to go to LGBT equality, but the fact we got closer in the last decade is in large part due to its trans pioneers and one pioneer in particular. You know what Im talking about andnot, you should: the cover of Vanity Fair in June . Caitlyn Jenner. Former Olympic athlete. Openly transgender woman.For Jenner, the photograph was an act of happiness. \"Im so happy after such a long struggle to be living my true self,\" she said when the magazine was published. \"Welcome to the world Caitlyn.\" And for those who saw the picture, it was an act of courage and activism. When is equality  When trans people are in parliaments, and in churches, and in governments, and on the cover of fashion magazines.MARK SMITHDONALD TRUMP, BORIS JOHNSON, NIGEL FARAGE AND VLADIMIR PUTIN, POPULIST POLITICIANSVladimir Putin is about to mark  years in power ndash he first became Russian president on December ,  ndash and for much of that time the West has looked at his style ndash authoritarian, bombastic and a little bit silly ndash and thought: thank God were not like that.But that was then. First, a man with a fag in his mouth ndash call me Nigel ndash became leader of Ukip and the Brexit Party. Then a man with a phone in his hand ndash call me Donald ndash became president of the United States. And then a man with an inappropriate phrase on the tip of his tongue ndash call me Boris ndash became Prime Minister of the UK.Its not a coincidence they are known by their Christian names. Nigel, Donald and Boris represent a new, first-names-only style of politics that has dominated America and the UK in the last  years: populist, chummy, big on rhetoric, light on detail, and ndash much to the frustration of liberals ndash effective at attracting votes. Those three men have attracted support from working class voters who have traditionally looked to the left for answers. In the last  years, though, theyve looked right, and the result is Nigel, Donald and Boris.The next decade will decide their fate. Arguably, Farage has already been neutered after the Brexit Partys dismal election campaign. But the fates of Trump and Johnson are less certain. Trump has been impeached and will face a trial in the Senate, but its controlled by the Republicans, who arent going to vote their man out. As for Johnson, hes just won a big, blue majority and, failing a cock-uphes going to be here for the next five years.Beware:  years of populism may become .MARK SMITHPROFESSOR PETER HIGGS, SCIENTISTScience always plays the long game. It took almost a century for scientists in  to prove Einsteins  predictions of gravitational waves in space, which formed part of his theory of general relativity. Professor Peter Higgs didnt have to wait quite that long.Back in , while teaching at Edinburgh University, Higgs published papers predicting the existence of a particle that gave mass to the most basic building blocks of matter. It soon became known as the Higgs Boson. Much to his dismay, it was also called the God particle.No-one could find it, however. Or not until , when the large hadron collider near Geneva finally proved its existence.A year later Higgs, then , won the Nobel Prize in Physics, sharing the prize with fellow scientist Francois Englert.Higgs decided to go on holiday when the prize was announced, neglecting to take his mobile phone with him in a bid to avoid being pestered by journalists. They could wait. He had, after all.TEDDY JAMIESONEL JAMES, AUTHORThere was a moment, in the summer of , where everywhere you looked someone had their nose in a copy Fty Shades of Grey.

Neither do the lizards in India. But the Trigonopterus attenboroughi beetle and the Sitana attenboroughii lizard are named after an exceptional member of homo sapiens: Sir David Attenborough. Its quite a tributeonly they knew it.Why is he exceptional  Because before Sir David, one of the few ways to see animals was through bars in a zoo, and before Sir David you may have used a plastic bag without thinking about it very much.Then we saw his ground-breaking programme Blue Planet and we heard the facts. More than  million tonnes of plastic are drting in the oceans and every year, this sea of plastic is causing the deaths of one million birds and , sea mammals.Sir David tells it as it is: \"Its vile, its horrid and its something we are clearly seeing inflicted on the natural world and having a dreadful effect and theres something we can do about it. So in a way its a bit of a litmus test to seethe population care about it.\":From the death of Bowie to the rise of grime: The decade in pop musicThe reason Sir David is one of the great men and women of the last decade is hes made us care about it, and the planet, and the le on it.Sir David is hopeful on the whole ndash \"I think were all shting our behaviour,\" he says ndash but his message of the last decade is that the next one is our last chance for change.

Mr MacAlindinrsquos book, Upbeat, about the orchestra, became a best seller.But battle weary, he came home to Scotland three years ago and moved to Govan next door to the Fairfield Shipyard.Incredibly, against the odds, he set-up the first orchestra to be founded as part of the urban regeneration of the area - replicating some of the lessons he learned in Iraq.ldquoMany charities had been working for years to bring intensive care and expertise to Govan. But with one-in-three in poverty, and unemployment reaching through some families for generations, fighting against the hopelessness and all the problems that arose from it was for many a long, slow, uphill battle on an inidual level, said Mr MacAlindin.ldquoI asked myself how could classical music ever have a meaningful place for Govanrsquos people Now the orchestra he set-up in Govan has already won multiple awards and a musical offshoot for refugees is also proving a trail blazer.There is even a collaboration between a hip hop act and the orchestra that has also become a major success.Mr MacAlindin started with Govanrsquos ldquofabulous Victorian venues which had been lovingly restored.So, he set about organising seven concerts for string orchestra, which he called The Glasgow Barons as a nod to the ship barons who had built the yard he was neighbour to, which would play Tchaikovsky, Bach, Dvorak, and also living Scottish composers like Bill Sweeney.But they still needed rooted in Govan. So, along he went to the Govan Reminiscence Group, the elderly custodians of Govanrsquos heritage, and asked for their help to write brand new folk songs on local heroines and heroes such as Mary Barbour, whose rent strikes of  protected people against rent sharks through the war, Private Lawrence Nealis who, at , faked his age to sign up and died in France in  and Lizzie Robinson, who never missed a sht at the Cardonald munitions factory and became the first woman to be awarded an OBE by King George V.Up and coming singer-songwriters from the Scottish folk scene, Ainsley Hamill and Norrie McIver, worked closely with them to write  new songs and perform them at the centre of each of Mr MacAlindinrsquos concerts.ldquoI couldnrsquot believe the response. I was by being stopped in the street by neighbours who loved the last concert and were asking when the next one was, said Mr MacAlindin.However, the troubling statistic that Govan had Glasgowrsquos highest child poverty at % led him to conclude that The Glasgow Barons would need to address the musical needs of young people in Govan.The Govan Little Pipers already had a roaring reputation, and Govan Highrsquos music department seemed to be bursting at the seams with exciting work.So Mr MacAlindin gave them, along with Pirie Park and Riverside Primaries, composers-in-residence Jenner Martin and Kevan OrsquoReilly to do composition workshops over  weeks where the pupils would create and perform their own music next to the Glasgow Baronsrsquo professional musicians.ldquoGovan is a tough place for a child to learn a musical instrument: boys may feel pressured in a heavily pro-football environment that music shouldnrsquot be for them, home le may not be ideal to help with practice with many kinship carers in place ndash the grannies and grandads, uncles and aunties who look after kids when the parents are absent - and while Glasgow still offers free instrumental school tuition and lends instruments to learners, the waiting lists can be long, admitted Mr MacAlindin.ldquoAnd yet, everyone knows how vital music lessons are to the development of children, how they can be future proofed through the arts with multiple skills on many levels.So, for those kids who couldnrsquot directly participate in music, he brought Norrie McIver and the strings of The Glasgow Barons into the schools to perform their folk songs about Govan.ldquoBut part of me was still thinking about his musicians in Iraq, how during the Iraq war they had stayed at home with an often poor quality musical instrument and downloaded fingering charts, breathing advice and copied videos of classical music off the fledgeling YouTube in order to stay sane and keep making music. For them, music was the buffer between their young lives and the insanity of war raging outside their front doors. Their resilience and passion to learn was second to none, said the conductor.So, he found partners to reach out to asylum seekers in Glasgow.At the beginning of the year, Mr MacAlindiin started Musicians in Exile in earnest and after only six months working together, it had become such a phenomenon that the group won the National Diversity Award as Community Organisation for Race, Religion and Faith, as well as the Voluntary Arts EPIC Award for Scotland.ldquoAll I was doing was giving people their voice back to make the music they knew back home, said Mr MacAlindin. ldquoFor the musicians, this was home from home, a replacement family from the one they had been forced to leave behind, and three hours a week to forget everything they were going through and had gone through.ldquoPlenty of people living in Govan have their own vulnerabilities. Kids who leave school early find themselves in street gangs, drug dealing, getting into trouble, and whilst organisations try to keep Govanrsquos kids out of trouble, the scale of the task is daunting.ldquoThe Glasgow Barons have captured the heart of Govan.\"In the judgersquos citation at the Scottish Urban Regeneration Awards, they wrote: ldquoThis fledgeling project has really captured the soul of Govan and is obviously having an inspirational impact on the community and providing genuine opportunities for previously excluded residents."},{"url":null,"title":"agenda-areas-renewed-focus-human-rights","story":"HUMAN rights is not a seasonal occupation ndash we donrsquot have quiet periods or peak times.

And that is why we are bringing our human rights demands for climate action to the streets, to companies and governments, and to UN conferences.Uyghur persecution ndash Arsenal footballer Mesut Ozil recently made headlines off the pitch for comments supporting Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim minorities held in internment camps in Xinjiang, prompting an angry response from the Chinese authorities. Amnesty International has extensively documented the situation in Xinjiang and interviewed more than  people outside of China whose relatives are missing, as well as iniduals who report being tortured while in detention camps there. An estimated one million people have been held in internment camps ndash a fact the Chinese government has repeatedly denied.

Hong Kong. Chile. Lebanon. Algeria. Ecuador. Sudan. Global school climate strikes. In the face of unrelenting public pressure, cruel leaders have been toppled and officials have abandoned plans for law reform and other measures that undermine rights. But governments have also responded with brutal force, leading to hundreds of deaths of protesters in Iran and in Iraq.

Independent consultancy advice supported this proposal.However, CMAL, Calmac and Transport Scotland favoured a single large ferryand harbour infrastructure investment at a cost of poundm. The total bill is now known to be poundm. The ferry cannot operate on another route and the displaced MV Isle of Lewis can only serve Barra and is not particularly appropriate for that route either as her design means she is limited in terms of freight capacity.With no local engagement, CMAL, Calmac and Transport Scotland decided to order one new ferry to replace the MV Hebrides on services to Harris and Uist.

Unfortunately the indications from the EU-Norway talks are that this did not happen and our fishing communities are going to feel the consequences.“Sustainability is important but we must remember that no one has more incentive to ensure sustainable fisheries than family-owned businesses and fishing communities. These groups depend on having reliable stocks now and for future generations.”He continued: “Amongst all the technical discussions and ideological debates, the direct impact on local communities who are reliant on fishing and the surrounding industries is being forgotten. Sustainable fisheries should protect the long-term success of our distinct fishing communities. I hope that the key players in these talks, and our Government, can set aside ideology and reflect on the social impact of quota changes.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”The government’s failure to fund the ageing inter-island ferry fleet has left Orkney’s most remote and vulnerable communities with an inferior service compared to other areas in Scotland claimed Councillor Stockan.Following a y battle, the council secured £. million in additional government funding for internal ferry services for   — described by Councillor Stockan at the time as the “most signicant financial breakthrough” made by the council in years.The air of positivity failed to last however.OIC say they need £. million to run services in the current financial year — £. million more than the Scottish Government allocation.“This is a burden that most other Scottish councils do not have to bear,” Councillor Stockan continued. “The greater the burden placed on the council to keep the ferries running, the greater the risk of severe cuts to other vital services our community depends upon.“We need a long-term commitment from the government to fully fund the cost of running the service and replacing vessels with modern, cheaper-to-run ferries of a standard you would expect on routes as important as these.”RET was also in Councillor Stockan’s sights.The tarf, which would see cheaper fares for all when travelling across the Pentland Firth, has been mired in legal proceedings with Pentland Ferries making a complaint to the European Commission.From the outset, those at Holyrood said they were committed to see the scheme introduced within the first six months of . However, there appears to be no resolution in sight as we now head into .“It is outrageous that we in Orkney are still waiting for RET and that there appears to be no urgency or political will from the Government to resolve this.“Again, this is a clear case of discrimination against Orkney and our community will find it abominable that the money the government has saved by failing to introduce RET on our routes has been spent where — when it could have been committed to supporting our internal ferry service.“This is why I have written to the First Minister and appealed for her to intervene and ensure that Orkney is treated as fairly as other coastal communities with leline ferry services.”In response, a Scottish Government spokesperson indicated that the government was committed to finding a resolution to the issues raised.The spokesperson said: “At present, Orkney Islands Council are wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.#However, the Scottish Government understands the signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities and we have made clear our commitment to Orkney internal ferry services with the provision of additional revenue funding support totalling £. million in the last two years.“We continue to discuss long term solutions with both Orkney Islands Council and Shetland Islands Council. We established a working group to examine these issues and we are now in receipt of the final report which we are currently considering.”The spokesperson continued: “It is the responsibility of inidual local authorities to manage their own budgets and to allocate the total financial resources available to them, including on ferry services, on the basis of local needs and priorities, having first fulfilled their statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities.“Ultimately, it is for locally elected representatives to make local decisions on how best to deliver services to their local communities.“Ministers remain committed to pursuing all avenues to deliver RET for Orkney and Shetland, however, the first step is to resolve the complaint that Pentland Ferries have made to the European Commission.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It suggests rearing bugs, which can be used to make feed for animals and humans, organic fertilisers and even green fuel, offers a sustainable way to produce more food using less resources.And Scotland is an ideal location due to its massive aquaculture industry, vast supplies of organic feed stock and academic expertise.Nearly , tonnes of agricultural feedstock is chucked away in this country each year, but the report suggests that using just a tenth of it for insect farming could generate an extra £. million for the Scottish economy.Dr William Clark, ZWSrsquos bio-economy specialist, wrote the new guidance for would-be insect farmers as changing regulations open up more markets.He said: ldquoFarming insects in Scotland might sound unlikely or unappetising but it could play a signicant role in solving Scotlandrsquos food waste problem and reducing our reliance on imported crops like soy for agriculture and aquaculture, which drives up the carbon emissions behind the climate crisis.ldquoInsect farms offer a reliable, sustainable, circular-economy solution to the protein gap. For although the world produces enough food for everyone, more than a third of it goes to waste so people donrsquot get the protein they need. ldquoOn top of that, farming insects can also produce valuable by-products such as biodiesel, bioplastics and organic fertilisers.European Union regulations introduced in  allow farming of seven insect species, including field crickets and black soldier flies. Farms can be powered by waste heat from other processes, while the grubs can be fed on pre-consumer food waste from supermarkets, arable farms and bakeries.The insects can then be fed to farmed fish or used to make pet food.The Scottish Aquaculture Innovation Centre estimates that demand for insect protein from fish farming alone is worth more than £ million per year.Black soldier flies have been highlighted as a suitable species for cultivation in the UK as they do not carry human or livestock diseases and their tropical origins mean they do not pose a risk of becoming an invasive species.As yet Scotland has no insect farms, but Dr Clark believes the sector offers enormous potential. And to start up in business requires a relatively small outlay, compared to conventional farming.ldquoYou can set up an insect farm in a few shipping containers, he said.ldquoYou donrsquot need the acres of fields which traditional farming requires to feed more typical livestock, so insect farms arenrsquot competing for the same limited resources, like land and water. ldquoThey can produce about  times more protein per year from the same amount of space than you would get by farming chicken or cattle.ldquoScotlandrsquos food waste could support dozens of insect farms and jobs. ldquoFirms and governments around the world are already reaping the economic and environmental benefits of investing in this innovative approach. ldquoItrsquos time Scotland did the same.Early in  EU laws are expected to be extended to allow insects to be farmed to produce feed for poultry and pigs too.Regulations covering novel foods were updated in  to include farming insects to produce food for people direct.Nearly £. billion of food is binned every year in Scotland alone.In terms of carbon emissions, food waste is bad for the environment.When thrown away, not only its nutritional value wasted but also the water, soil, nutrients, work hours, energy, transport and plastic packaging involved in producing and selling it.Thomas Farrugia is the founder of pioneering Edinburgh-based firm Beta Bugs, which breeds black soldier flies to supply insect farms.He says a growing number of people, including regular farmers, are showing interest in the emerging sector.He said: ldquoItrsquos great that Zero Waste Scotland has produced this guidance, which really ties into the interest wersquore seeing in ersication from traditional farmers and other businesses. ldquoMore and more people are asking us about this. They are thinking that in the future traditional livestock-rearing might not be an option and this could be the next thing.ldquoChicken farming started with farmers wanting to ersy. First they cleared some space for asingle chicken shed, which worked well, so then over time they put up more sheds and eventually became chicken farmers. ldquoThe same could well happen with insects.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"dani garavelli something of the knight about iain duncan smith","story":"It#s harrowing that the daily heroism of the poorest Britons goes almost unnoticed while the author of their woes is handed a gong, writes Dani GaravelliOne of the most powerful documentaries of  was Growing Up Poor: Britain’s Breadline Kids. Directed by Jezza Neumann, it allowed a handful of children to give first-hand accounts of le on the financial margins.The fact those featured were so young stripped their commentary of artice. They talked in matter-of-fact tones of hardships that would have broken many adults. Courtney, eight, who lives in Cambridge – “the most unequal city in the UK” – counted out coppers in the hope there would be enough for heating, before resigning herself to another night spent sleeping in her coat. Cameron, a pale and undernourished boy, described eking out diminishing food supplies. “We try not to eat a lot in one day, even though most of us are really hungry,” he said.Growing Up Poor painted a picture of the UK that made A Christmas Carol, with all its paternalism, feel entirely contemporary a world where the working poor are forced to survive on charity hand-outs.It was jam-packed with heroes. There was Danielle, who tried to carve out a bit of space in temporary accommodation to study for her GCSEs, and Courtney’s mother, who drew a chart to try to explain her depression to her daughter. Then there were those who donated to and ran the food banks, and Neumann himself, who avoided all the pitfalls of poverty porn to bring us this thoughtful piece of film-making. The villains – the architects of the Westminster government’s austerity programme – were less visible, but ever-present, behind the scenes, undermining the foundations that used to keep the lives of the underprivileged stable. Iain Duncan Smith’s welfare reforms were the dark heart of Growing Up Poor. Whatever his original intention, those reforms and the striver skiver rhetoric they produced were responsible for pushing just-coping families into destitution .And yet Duncan Smith is among those being rewarded in the New Year’s Honours list. Much to the horror of anti-poverty campaigners, the man behind Universal Credit, the bedroom tax and the two-child cap – three of the most odious policies of the decade – is being knighted because ofthe havoc he wreaked. That’s the way it goes nowadays. Those who sow chaos and confusion are gloried, while those left to pick up the pieces of their own and other people’s lives remain in the shadows. The likes of Duncan Smith lack the insight to be embarrassed by such unseemly boys’ club back-slapping. He will doubtless regard himself as a fitting recipient of the title Sir – asUniversal Credit had fulfilled its mission of helping millions back into work rather than entrenching misery and social exclusion.It was, famously, in Easterhouse, that Duncan Smith experienced an epiphany. Back in , he wept in the face of condemned tenements and boarded up lives. This moment of empathy inspired him to evangelise about “compassionate Conservatism”. Under his leadership, he pledged, the Tories would become “the natural party of those who want to make a better le for themselves and their children”.How hollow that sounds now. Yet, with hindsight, that phrase foreshadowed everything that would go wrong with his welfare reforms. It hinted at that most Dickensian of binaries: the deserving and the undeserving poor. It made a spurious distinction between “those who want to make a better le for themselves” and those considered too feckless to care.There are groups, including the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, who believe Universal Credit was a good idea in principle. It was aimed at simplying an over-complicated system by rolling six benefits into one, and – more importantly – at incentivising people to work.The logic was, on the face of it, unimpeachable. The way the benefits system was structured meant those who moved from claiming, say, Jobs Seekers Allowance, to low-paid employment would often find themselves losing out financially, which cannot be right.But with this logic came other shakier assumptions: that everyone ought to be entering the labour market that no-one would ever be too ill to work or have other competing pressures on their time, such as caring for children, the elderly or the disabled.And so a new era was indeed ushered in: an era of sanctions and Atos fitness-for-work tests, which saw benefit claimants penalised for attending funerals and the chronically ill forced to prove they had not staged some miraculous recovery. It was the era of being punished for having an extra bedroom – evenyour own child slept in it every other weekend. It was the era of growing mental health dficulties and soaring suicides. The era of I, Daniel Blake.Universal Credit caused more problems than it solved,it solved any. It was supposed to help people into work. But in , the Institute for Fiscal Studies claimed some groups, such as single parents, had less of an incentive to work under Universal Credit than the old system and that . million working families faced an average loss of £, a year.The five-week hiatus before Universal Credit was received meant claimants like Courtney’s mother had no money to feed their children. They were forced to go to food banks or to take out loans they had no hope of repaying.By the time the National Audit Office issued its scathing report in , Duncan Smith was gone. He resigned over cuts to disability benefits in , and four more work and pensions secretaries followed in quick succession. But the conceptual and logistical flaws the NAO report identied were ones that originated under his watch. Head of the organisation, Amyas Morse, said the case for Universal Credit was based on unproven assumptions. “We think the larger claims for universal credit, such as boosted employment, are unlikely to be demonstrable at any point in future,” he said.Nor has the situation improved over the last  months. Last month, the UN rapporteur for extreme poverty, Philip Alston, said the UK government’s austerity policies were driven by “a political desire for social engineering” and that key elements of the post war social contract devised by William Beveridge had been swept away.Alston also insisted the UK government was in a state of denial about reports suggesting  million people, a fth of the population, now live in poverty, with . million destitute.It is in the same spirit of denial, no doubt, that Duncan Smith was offered and accepted his knighthood. His elevation further undermines an already discredited honours system. \u2028But it is entirely in tune with today’s politics: cruelty and incompetence rewarded by a self-promoting clique, while those working long hours to improve people’s lives might as well be invisible.As the MP for Chingford and Woodford Green kneels on the red carpet at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle, what will Courtney be doing  Or Cameron  Or Danielle  They will be struggling on, supporting their parents through the worst of their misery. Unfortunately, there are no knighthoods for stoicism. Or resilience. Or making the best of things.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"euan mccolm who can consign the jeremy corbyn era to the dustbin of history","story":"The last thing Labour needs is continuity in its quest for a leader who isn#t embarrassed to be a patriot, says Euan McColmWhen Jeremy Corbyn became leader of the Labour Party in , he promised a new kind of politics. He certainly delivered that.Now in the grip of a hard-left cabal, Corbyn’s party is a sectarian mess, a safe place for anti-Semites and crank conspiracists. But the leader of the Opposition hasn’t succeeded only in creating a new kind of politics. He has also introduced a new way of losing elections.Clinging to leadershipThere was a time when a leader so comprehensively humiliated in a general election would have resigned immediately, offering profound apologies to all in his party who had been failed by him.Corbyn’s dferent kind of defeat has involved him clinging on to the leadership, arguing – pathetically – that Labour won the argument, and seeing that the advisers who directed the party’s election disaster are signed up to permanent contracts, protecting them from the fate – redundancy – that is now befalling scores of junior staffers.Corbyn says he is remaining in place so that the party can go through a period of reflection on its defeat. Once it is clear what went wrong, he’ll shuffle off and a leadership election will tasked place.This is all bulls**t, of course. Ask any Labour activist why the party lost the general election and,they are honest, they will tell you that the party’s biggest problem was Corbyn. Time and again while canvassing, candidates were told by voters – many of whom had backed Labour all their lives – that they simply couldn’t support the party while he was in charge. Among the reasons were anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, a manesto full of promises that appeared wildly unaffordable, and the leader’s record of siding – throughout history – with the United Kingdom’s enemies.Scottish LabourNow, we witness the pitul efforts of Labour members to persuade themselves that among those who are tipped to run for the top job there are credible candidates who will turn round the party’s fortunes.Labour in Scotland has been in crisis for more than a decade. The SNP has slipped into the political space once occupied by its opponents.But south of the border, things are not yet so bleak for Labour.This will soon changemembers make a foolish decision when it comes to choosing the new leader.In the immediate aftermath of the general election, there was much chatter about the need for Labour to choose a leader who was both northern and female. The logic ran that voters who had turned their nose up at a London-based leader would the leader was someone with whom they could more easily identy.This is nonsense. Voters in the north of England who turned from Corbyn decided to put their faith in Boris Johnson. The flatness of the Labour leader’s vowels has nothing to do with their decision.The Corbyn continuity candidate in the coming leadership election campaign will probably be the wholly unimpressive Rebecca Long Bailey, a northerner who was  per cent behind the sainted Jeremy, even when it was clear he was unfit for office.The importance of patriotismLong Bailey will face challenges from Sir Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry, neither of whom has done much to make one think they can turn Labour’s fortunes around. Both seem as distant from the voting public as Corbyn ever did. And both, I’m afraid, are tainted by playing central roles in supporting the Corbyn project which has been so roundly rejected by the electorate.Labour’s media outriders, those columnists and pundits who made careers out of excusing Corbyn’s associations with terrorists and his failure to deal adequately with anti-Semitism, really struggle to deal with the popularity of Johnson with a signicant number of working class voters.At the heart of their confusion lies one of the big problems with the Corbyn project – the failure of its adherents to recognise the importance of patriotism. In dismissing anyone who declares even the slightest affection for the country of their birth as a petty nationalist, the Corbynista offends the small “c” conservative voter who thinks the UK has often been a force for good.Accepting this reality is crucial to the Labour Party’s survival.Swathes of the Labour membership will continue to delude themselves that their man won the argument and that what is needed is a new face to present ideas put forward by Corbyn.But smarter activists will think carefully about how Labour can rebuild a connection with voters who have abandoned the party. The first step in this process is accepting that Labour cannot expect the voters to come to the party. Rather, the party must go to them.Social democratThe new leader should be a social democrat rather than a revolutionary socialist, someone who isn’t ashamed to sing the national anthem, and someone who is as untainted as it is possible to be by association with Corbyn.Were I a member of the Labour Party with a vested interest in its survival, I’d be encouraging Dan Jarvis to step forward. Jarvis, a former soldier, was spoken about as a possible challenger for the leadership when Ed Miliband quit in .Instead of stepping into that fight, Jarvis – MP for Barnsley Central – turned his attention to his local area, campaigning successfully to become mayor of the Sheffield City Region.Jarvis succeeded in the mayoral battle on his own terms, without the patronage of Corbyn.Recently, Jarvis said it was time for Labour to make a “clean break” with the Corbyn era. That politics had failed, he said, and it was time to start rebuilding credibility.Unsurprisingly, Corbynistas were horried by Jarvis’s remarks. He is not one of them, after all, and is therefore to be treated with a mixture of suspicion and contempt.But Jarvis was right. Labour’s credibility has been shot to Hell by Jeremy Corbyn and a fresh start is essential.If Dan Jarvis does enter the leadership race, he’ll start as an outsider, buthe can reach out beyond the party to the general public and win opinion poll support, he may force Labour members to ask themselves whether it’s time to think about how they start winning again.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

That shouldn’t mean a negative focus on EU citizens living here, but as British and European leaders arm-wrestle their way through the year ahead, producing us versus them narratives and “Hop off you frogs” headlines aplenty, it probably will. In  a new Labour leader will probably officially embrace Brexit and leave millions of Remain voters south of the Border without any means of democratic expression, thanks also to the collapse of the bickering People’s Vote campaign and the leaderless Lib Dems. Anyone hoping the main Westminster opposition parties will swtly recover from the failed Brexit battles of yesteryear to refocus on the human rights battles of tomorrow is likely to be disappointed.The enlarged cohort of SNP MPs has the energy, mandate and moral authority to champion the views of the “losing” side, raise important questions about the way Brexit is managed and persuade gung-ho Leave voters that giving Boris carte blanche over every aspect of British le is not a good idea. But the third largest party at Westminster is customarily ignored by politicians and the mainstream media. There’s no reason to think  will be any dferent.South of the Border at least, Europeanism has suddenly become as unfashionable and last season as glittery cards, wrapping paper, carols and Brussels sprouts – a Christmas tradition which could, incidentally, disappearrivals follow the example set this Christmas by Morrisons and Asda and rebadge their sprouts with local origins. Soon, Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Scottish sprouts will be all we’ve ever known.A small thing perhaps and both supermarkets insist that pleasing Brexiters played no part in their re-labelling decisions. But maybe a sign of things to come. A sign that anything or anyone from a European country will soon smack of an alien culture. Is this overstating things  The statistics suggest not.The number of hate crimes recorded by police in England and Wales has more than doubled from , in - to a new record of , in  while the number of cases passed to prosecutors has dropped from  to just  per cent. Admittedly, referral rates have dropped across all types of offence, hate crimes sometimes don’t have named suspects, and out-of-court disposals don’t result in criminal charges. Suspects are also harder to identy when anonymous accounts are used to send abuse and threats online. But still, as weekend stabbings in a rabbi’s home north of New York City amply testy, attacks on minorities can happen in apparently tolerant environments. And Britain is not likely to be all that tolerant a place in . If EU leaders take a tough stance during forthcoming trade talks – as they surely must – the hostile and triumphalist Europhobic British press will have a field day, demonising EU institutions and painting European leaders as robbers and thugs determined to cheat the noble, freedom-seeking Brits. In this unpleasant and toxic political environment, unsuspecting, ordinary EU citizens will be on the receiving end of anti-Brussels sentiment. Indeed, that nasty process has already started, in some very surprising locations.A few customers at the Ceilidh Place Hotel and restaurant in Ullapool objected to a tiny EU flag mounted over the cash-desk. Days later, a French waiter was effectively told to get back home by a guest. Now all waiting staff wear T-shirts sporting the -stars of the EU flag on their backs, in solidarity with their French colleague and anyone  picked on for their ethnicity. Thanks to the hotel owners’ strong public stance, there’s been open discussion about changing public behaviour and some visitors have revealed bruising encounters they’ve experienced where. One Portuguese man living here for almost a decade, said customers now regularly demand to be served by “someone who speaks English properly,” at his workplace – a large High Street department store in Scotland. His English is almost perfect. A workmate also told him to stop using his native tongue while chatting with two other Portuguese speakers in the staff canteen. Are these incidents unusual one-offs or the tip of an iceberg set to grow larger as Britain’s acrimonious withdrawal from the EU dominates front pages and political discourse in   How will employers and managers respond Scotland prides itself on welcoming New Scots and Nicola Sturgeon was widely praised for reaching out to EU citizens straight after the  referendum, reassuring all who’d chosen to live and work here that Scotland was their home. This message of international solidarity gets loud cheers at independence rallies – partly because it neatly distinguishes Scots from very dferent English attitudes towards immigration, Europe and international cooperation. But are we just virtue-signalling and kidding ourselves  Are EU citizens getting almost as many pointed and unpleasant jibes in Remain-voting Scotland as Brexit-voting England  It’s impossible to know for sure. But these and other incidents should prompt the SNP to try and reconfigure the Westminster debate before Britain withdraws on  January. Otherwise, a very nasty scenario could develop – one in which EU nationals are singled out, pilloried and turned into scapegoats for the political and economic uncertainty that will inevitably arise as a wildly over-promising Conservative leader hits the brick wall of an unyielding and united bloc of EU trade negotiators. Agreed – the notion that Britain might somehow remain in the EU or single market, through the mechanism of a second vote, or a Remain alliance at Westminster is now officially dead, but the idea of a part-European identity and the internationalising impact of freedom of movement has always meant more to Scots Remain voters than the arcane details of tarf-free trade, and harmonised regulations. It still does. Protecting the rights of EU citizens living amongst us is an expression of enlightened self-interest, curiosity about other cultures, gratitude for the energy and enthusiasm of incomers and recognition of the enduring importance of respecting cultural and ethnic dference. Boris Johnson’s self-imposed December trade negotiations deadline is bound to ramp up anti-European, anti-foreigner rhetoric.If Scotland wants to remain a proud “mongrel nation”, we must hold the line against any descent into foreigner-blaming.

These trucks will often be carrying weapons materials for maintenance or replacement.The FOI revealed the convoys, which ferry Trident weapons, have suffered  safety incidents in the past five years, including problems caused by poor maintenance.Nationalist MSP Bill Kidd SNP warned that “MoD complacency” while transporting nuclear bombs could be catastrophic.The SNP has long campaigned for the removal of nuclear weapons from the Clyde.“People will be shocked to learn that Scotland’s roads are regularly being used by military convoys with nuclear warheads on board,” Mr Kidd said.“Any one of these safety lapses is concerning, but people will be surprised these issues are so common.“It is bad enough that Scotland is forced to house these weapons of mass destruction, but these safety incidents are deeply worrying. There must be absolutely no complacency when it comes to handling nuclear weapons.“The MoD has a history of secrecy, complacency and reluctance to report its faults – safety lapses such as these simply cannot be swept under the rug.”A spokesman for the MoD said: “Public safety is our absolute priority and robust arrangements are in place to ensure the safety and security of all convoys.“The incidents reported include minor issues such as replacing a windscreen wiper blade on a single vehicle in a -vehicle convoy.

What exactly are we to read into #meeting Shetland#s energy needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers# There is an implied promise there, and even a threat, but no actual guarantee of cheaper bills for local residents.As for #unlocking Shetland#s renewable potential#, this looks like code for unlocking their potential to exploit the landscape and the people through environmentally harmful proposals the people will get no say in.Shetland remains in thrall to the notion that all potential economic activity is necessarily a positive development.Some developments however represent an approach to development that dlsempowers, robs folk of a say and foists solutions onto them that do not address their problems or needs.There will be opportunities for some to profit no doubt, but is is hard for the council to dispassionately manage partnership with these far larger players when they are so wowed by the prospect of cash flowing into the reserves through ground rent to the Busta estate.The SIC will do diddlysquat to ensure local concerns are considered.I do wonder what those who think wind energy is the green way forward for Shetland think about the irony of it being used to power more fossil fuel production .."},{"url":null,"title":"ninian scoops window prize for second year running ","story":"There were winners galore in Lerwick town centre on Monday as the top Christmas window was announced and the Elf trail came to an end.Ninian staff receive the trophy for the best Christmas window.

We have had ‘sympathy’ from the UK Government through the Secretary of State, from all political parties that stood on our picket lines and from the leadership of the health service. But we have no resolution.“UNISON has agreed emergency cover and our members have volunteered to provide it. We have never seen such determination in health workers who have been devalued and disrespected for almost  years. For  weeks they have stood up for their rights and have now put the health service at the top of the political agenda.“Despite their sacrice there is still no action from those in power. It would appear that health workers, patients and the public at large are being used as pawns in a political game.“As we enter this signicant period in the industrial struggle the consequences lay firmly on the shoulders of the UK Government, our elected politicians and the leadership of the civil service.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers.

This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do. They are testament to the work that they do themselves with our projects.“Our projects are all voluntary and everything is in the young person’s hands. Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"20 northern ireland people we said goodbye to","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I dont think time is going to make any dference. I think hanging around, delay, not making decisions is not going to make any dference, it is only going to cause more heartache and problems for citizens in Northern Ireland,\" he said.DUP MLA Edwin Poots said his party would only sign up to a \"fair and balanced\" deal.\"There has been some effort by others to box us into a corner and force us into a position where we do not get a fair and balanced deal,\" he said.Northern Ireland has been without a government for almost three years, when the Sinn Fein collapsed the executive amid a row over the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal.Sticking points in the several failed attempts to restore power sharing since then have included an Irish language act, reform of the controversial petition of concern, and dealing with the legacy of the Troubles.Sinn Feins Mary Lou McDonald said a deal can be done.\"It is in the interests of all our people that we establish good government and real power sharing based on equality and respect,\" she said.\"The outstanding issues can be resolved. The time for acrimony and ision is over. The time for slogans and soundbites is over. The test now for every party that has talked up getting back to work is to go back to the Executive table and deliver.\"Meanwhile, Mrs McDonald has also proposed a five-year time frame for a border poll.\"To that end, we need a forum or a Citizens Assembly to talk about Ireland post-Brexit, to plan for constitutional change, to ensure that the path to reunication is inclusive, orderly and peaceful, because it is reckless to refuse to plan for the future,\" she said.\"The Irish government and those parties who reiterate this position are acting recklessly and are not protecting or respecting any section of our people - unionist, nationalist or otherwise.\""},{"url":null,"title":"dup mp opposes call to ban hunting with dogs","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Paul had a very busy job and kept himself very active. He was a painter and decorator. Paul had never been off work sick or never had to attend any hospital appointments. It all seemed to happen so quickly when he had a fall and went to casualty for what we both thought would just be a few stitches, to be told in three weeks later of his diagnosis was so devastating for us both. googletag.cmd.push ‘Then the angels came’One week later Paul and I met with the Motor Neurone Nurse who explained how the illness would affect Paul, our family and home le. I remember that day both of us walking back from hospital, sitting on the benches at Foyle Marina and thinking “I feel like I am outside looking in at everybody getting on with their daily lives”. How were Paul and I going to cope and deal with this devastating disease  Then the angels came.We were introduced to Foyle Hospice in January . Paul started going to the day hospice and almost immediately le seemed to become so much easier to cope with. I was able to go shopping, go out with my wonderful friends and not have to worryPaul was okay. Each and every inidual person who worked in the Day Hospice, Inpatient Unit or played a part in the day to day running of Foyle Hospice, gave us so much. That’s why I call them angels and I don’t say that lightly. googletag.cmd.push Live le to the fullWe experienced so much happiness, laughter and opportunities to make wonderful and precious memories as a family such as our trip to Lourdes. Myself, Paul and our family went on many weekends away where the hospice gave us advice on what to do to make those trips so much easier. It gave us the determination to live le to the full.Paul loved Manchester United Football Club. On many occasions we went over as a family. However, when Paul became ill he never thought he would be able to visit Old Trafford again. Thanks to his sister Claire and the guidance of the hospice team he was able to visit twice more. Paul met the team, watched them train, attended matches and had a tour of the stadium. Watching his happiness and delight was precious and gave us great memories to hold on to always.‘Amazing people and friends’Paul also spent periods of time in the Inpatient Unit for respite. Our family was able to get away from everything clinical and get a break to recharge ourselves, although Paul was never far from our thoughts. We were confident he was happy and really well looked after. In fact, he was spoiled by both staff in Day Hospice and Inpatient Unit. Paul would be smiling from ear to ear. I also spent many days and nights in the Day Hospice and Inpatient Unit. The warmth, care and the welcome I received was just amazing. I felt so comfortable and made so many wonderful and amazing friends. I used to say, “I feel asI’m in a hotel with no bill to pay on the way out”. Paul said on several occasions he hated this disease buthe could take one good thing from it was the amazing people he met and the friends he made. I second that, it was Foyle Hospice who made that possible.

The X Box, the Playstation and Nintendo Wii offer an almost limitless choice of gaming s to enjoy inter-connectivity in a high definition world of colour. However,  years ago in , the new world of home video game consoles was a new monochrome phenomenon. The first company to launch a home video game console was the Calornia based form Atari. Founded in , the firm initially concentrated on designing arcade games. But as the decade progressed it became clear that the huge appetite for computer-based games was readily transferrable to the home. googletag.cmd.push By , one of Atari’s founders Nolan Bushell employed an engineering company that constructed a console capable of playing the original games designed by the pioneering firm for arcades. The result was the Atari Video Computer System . Released in September , the VCS was priced at the hefty sum of around pound – the equivalent of approximately pound today. The first incarnation of the system included a console, two joysticks, a pair of paddles and the Combat game cartridge. There were however eight other games available to be sold separately that included – Air-Sea Battle, Star Ship and Street Racer and Breakout. googletag.cmd.push Perhaps the most memorable of all the games of this era was Pong- the two-dimensional table tennis simulator. The game, originally developed as a training exercise in programming for an Atari employee, was one of the earliest arcade video games back in  and proved hugely commercially successful. A separate home version that could be played on a TV was released in . Players controlled game paddles by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen to hit a ball back and forth. The aim was to win by amassing eleven points. A point was won when one failed tothe ball to the other. The game was then included in the games for the Atari VCS two years later. Despite the obvious huge advances in gaming technology in the ensuing four decades the enduring appeal of Atari for people of a certain age remains. The Atari Flashback with the original games can still be bought today for around pound. But what other toys enthralled the children of the s  Launched in , the Nerf Ball was billed as the “world’s first official indoor ball”. The marketing team charged with selling what was essentially a large foam sphere, emphasised the safety aspect of the product by stating: “You can’t damage lamps or break windows. You can’t hurt babies or old people.” This simple message was very effective because four million Nerf Balls were sold in it’s first year in existence. Undoubtedly another of the favourite and best toys of the era was the Evel Knievel Stunt Cycle. Ideal Toys launched its popular line of toy bikes in  and zoned in on the antics of the crazy American stuntman to boost their sales. Knievel made a total of  jumps on his Harley Davidson that year including a leap over  vans at the start of that year. Whilst Evel is probably best remembered for his spectacular crashes rather than his successes, the sales of the toy did not crash and sold in millions. One of the few toys that made a full-blownto the commercial market  years after its original launch was Stretch Armstrong. Introduced to the world by the Kenner toy company in  the muscular male figure made of laytex rubber and filled with gelled corn syrup allows it to be stretched from its original size of  inches up to around  foot before reverting back to its normal shape. If a tear developed it could be repaired with an adhesive bandage and instructions on how to fix Stretch were included inside the box. Hasbro who bought the brand, very successfully brought Stretch Armstrong back to the market at the New York Toy Fair in . Christmas of course sees us all indulge in sweets and the s was no exception. Cadbury’s honed in on a novel way of enticing children to want their products even more. The Dairy Milk dispenser spat out inidual squares of the world-famous confectionary for the princely sum of p. The mini machines were replenished by refill packs sold at stores such as the now long gone Woolworth’s chain. The dispenser was also marketed on the basis that it had an added attraction of doubling up as a money box. But it’s suspectedthat after a while the chocolate refill packs were consumed without ever having seen the inside of the dispenser with the ‘saved’ two-pence pieces retrieved and spent quickly on something . First to three goals was the aim in the table top game Crossfire in the s. The object was to push one of the pucks through the opposing player’s goal by firing small metal ball bearings at them using the attached guns. The effect of the Star Wars film series on popular culture has been immense. But with the filmmakers initially dubious about the success of the first film in , manufacturers were seemingly reluctant to launch a toy franchise based on the film. As a result, Star Wars toys were slow to hit the shelves  years ago. When they did, the Kenner company found the demand was enormous and to begin with launched four figures. They expanded the range in  and effectively became a license to print money. But still demand often exceeded supply and the range was often hard to come by. As filming began for The Empire Strikes Back in spring  children were screaming for new merchandise that Christmas. And nothing has changed since. All that’s left to ponder about this range is the fate of the executive of the American toy company Mego who took the decision to turn down the chance to manufacture the Star Wars toy range. The firm established in , specialised in making toy figures and promptly folded in . If you want to buy an original s Girl’s Word made by Palitoy in good condition, it’ll cost you around pound on vintage toy sellers website. The original cost was pound – roughly the equivalent of what a vintage version will cost you now. Launched in the mid-s Girl’s World was a brunette or blonde model hair and make-up styling head. She had suction caps on the base so the toy could be attached to a table top whilst hair styling and make-up techniques could be practised. She also had an extraof hair inside the head, a small handle on the side of the base was turned to either make the hair grow or shrink back into the head, allowing her ‘stylist’ to change her hair style orwithout resulting to a pair of scissors. It could also be washed and styled using ‘human products’ without much damage to the hair itself. Tiny Tears was the must have ‘hi-tech’ doll of the s. No other toy possessed the ability to wet itself or cry ‘real-le’ tears, nor a baby’s bottle from which the liquid disappeared to produce the aforementioned seepage. Such was the level of innovation of the toy that Palitoy won the toy of the year award for it. Sexual equality has never been an issue for the toy manufacturing industry with its dedicated adherence to commercial gain based on pandering to the pockets of the parents of boys and girls. In the s The Bionic Woman and The Six Million Dollar Man covered these markets perfectly and will equally huge financial success which was ensured by the importation of the American TV series to these shores. Starring Lindsay Wagner the show aired between  and . The Bionic Woman series features Jaime Sommers, who takes on special high-risk government missions using her superhuman bionic powers. The Bionic Woman series was a spin-off from the s Six Million Dollar Man television science fiction action series. Like its parent program The Bionic Woman spawned its own line of toys. Kenner produced a -inch doll of the character, with similar features to the Steve Austin version , except instead of a bionic eye the dolls head would click when turned, simulating the sound of Jaimes bionic ear. Accessories for the doll released by Kenner included additional fashions, and a Bionic Beauty Salon playset. A metal lunchbox for children was available, as was a vinyl story record produced by Wonderland Records. Kenner produced a series of stickers and temporary tattoos featuring Jaime Sommers inidually and with Steve Austin. Considered as much a symbol of the s as much as any other item, the space hopper was actually invented in Italy by a company called Ledragomma which specialised in manufacturing rubber balls. Essentially, the hugely popular toy was a large heavy rubber balloon with two handles sticking out of the top and was inflated by a bicycle or car tyre pump. Children sat on the top of the hopper, held the two handles and bounced about to their hearts content.

However, its perhaps a forgotten fact that the beautul Christmas carol was written within the walled city of Derry. Originally written as a poem by Cecil Frances Alexander, the carol was first published in  in her work, Hymns for Little Children. A year later in , the English organist Henry John Gauntlett discovered the poem and set it to music. Mrs Cecil Frances Alexander was born at  Eccles Street, Dublin in April . She was the third child of Major John Humphreys of Norfolk and Elizabeth . Major Humphreys was land agent to the Fourth Earl of Wicklow and also to the Second Marquess of Abercorn. googletag.cmd.push Cecil Frances love of writing verse began in childhood and some of her inspiration came from a Dr Walter Hook, Dean of Chichester Cathedral. Her father encouraged her writing from a very young age and as a result she began a career as a prolic writer of hymns. By the time of her death at the age of  she had penned over  such works. In , Cecil Frances Humprheys married clergyman William Alexander in Strabane. He was later to become the Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe and the Primate of All Ireland. Bishop Alexander also wrote several books of poetry, the best known of which was St Augustines Holiday and Other Poems. googletag.cmd.push Mrs Alexanders later religious work was strongly influenced by her contact with the Oxford Movement and particularly John Keeble who edited her most famous anthology-Hymns for Little Children. In fact, the work had reached its th edition by the close of the th century. However, by the s, Cecil Frances Alexander had already become famed as a hymn writer. Her compositions became a steadfast feature of Church of Ireland hymnals and she also contributed lyrical and narrative poems to Dublin University Magazine under ious pseudonyms. Seven of these hymns were included in the  Church of Ireland Hymnal and eighteen more were included in A Supplement to Hymns Ancient and Modern in . Mrs Alexander was a involved in charitable work for most of her le and she was involved with sting up the Derry Home for Fallen Women and worked on the development of a district nursing service. Another classic hymn penned by Mrs Alexander, There Is a Green Hill Far Away has obviously endured the test of time but few realise the part that it has played in transforming the education of deaf children almost  years ago in the north of Ireland. Cecil Frances Alexander and her sister Anne were heavily involved in local church activities in Strabane including their visits to local families. On one of the visits they met a young deaf boy from a poor home in the area. They were greatly concerned about the loneliness of his existence and the fact he was alienated from learning, especially about Christian way of le. Both Cecil and Anne persuaded their father to allow them to use a small out building in the grounds of his home-Milltown House so they could establish a school for deaf children. It was a passion that would Cecil Frances would continue for the rest of her le and she dreamt of establishing a much larger institution of this kind. The proceeds from Hymns for Little Children made a hefty contribution to to what became known as the Derry and Raphoe Diocesan Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb. Cecil Frances dream became reality in September  when just a few weeks before she married William the foundation stone of the school was laid. Despite the onset of the Famine in the s education for deaf children in Ireland flourished and other schools of this nature opened up in Belfast, Dublin and Cork. Frances school first opened its doors in the summer of . In the following five years the school took in almost  children teaching skills that would help them succeed in a hearing world. Cecil Frances Alexander died on October ,  and was laid to rest in Derry City Cemetery. Rev Dr William Alexander, who had been born in Devon on April , in Devon passed away aged  on September ,  and was buried with his we. In , two years after William Alexanders death, a stained glass window by James Powell in memory of Cecil Frances was installed at the northern vestibule of St Columbs Cathedral in Derry financed by public donations. The three lights of the window refer to three of her hymns-Once in Royal Davids City, There Is a Green Hill Far Away and The Golden Gates Are Lted Up. Mrs Alexander is also commemorated by an Ulster History Circle blue plaque on Derrys Bishop Street. One of her most famous quotes remains: Do no sinful action, speak no angry word ye belong to Jesus, children of the Lord. Since , the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols at the Kings College Chapel Cambridge has begun its Christmas Eve service, with Dr Arthur Henry Manns arrangement of Once in Royal Davids City as the Processional hymn. Mann was organist at Kings between  and . In his arrangement, the first verse is sung by a boy chorister of the Choir of Kings Chapel as a solo. The second verse is sung by the choir, and the congregation joins in the third verse. Excluding the first verse, the hymn is accompanied by the organ. According to the tradition of the Kings College Choir, the soloist of this hymn is usually chosen on the day of the performance, when the choirmaster decides whose voice is the strongest on the day right before the broadcast. This carol was the first recording that the Kings College Choir under Boris Ord made for EMI in . Among others who have recorded it are Mary Chapin Carpenter, The Chieftains, Daniel ODonnell, The Seekers, The Mormon Tabernacle Choir, Petula Clark, Jethro Tull, Sineacutead OConnor and Sufjan Stevens, St. Pauls Choir School and most recently by the Irish group Celtic Woman in their album Voices of Angels.

It’s either too dry, there’s no taste from it at all, and to avoid both those complaints requests are made for the ‘dark’ meat to be served to you. But still the vast majority of us will sit down to eat turkey on Christmas Day – but how did the big bird from America find its way onto our plates and manage to remain a permanent Yuletide fixture for centuries  googletag.cmd.push Turkeys were first brought into these islands in  by explorer William Strickland and before that those who had the money to buy them ate geese, boars heads, pheasant and even peacocks. Yorkshire man Strickland acquired six of the birds from native American traders on his travels around the New World and duly shipped them back to England. With the arrival of the turkey, a th century poem described Christmas dinner as: “Beefe, mutton and porke, shred pies of the best, pig, veal goose and capon and turkey well drest.” This was accompanied by cheese, apples, nuts and “good drink.” The turkey was also devoured because of purely pratical reasons by farmers because they needed to keep their cows to produce milk and their chickens for eggs. In the sixteenth century eggs were almost a luxury item and were accordingly expensive. googletag.cmd.push It is a matter of historical record that King Henry VIII began the tradition of eating turkey on Christmas Day, but it wasnt really until after WWII that the bird became more popular than goose on the big day. An English farmer, Thomas Tusser noted that by  turkeys had started to adorn Christmas tables, but that as well as geese another bird – the capon – a castrated rooster – remained the fowl of choice. And, that remained the case for another few centuries. By  turkey appears as a meat used in households as noted in a book called The English Housewe written by Gervase Markham. In the s the London Poulters Guild recorded that they had begun to give the company clerk a turkey as a Christmas gt. In the Victorian era, turkey was still too expensive to buy in comparison to its alternatives. There was a ision in tastes between northern and southern England. In the north, roast beef was favoured while in the south, goose remained the traditional choice. Poor families mostly made do with rabbit whether they were from the north or south. Recent research shows that today the average worker will need to toil for around . hours to afford a turkey, but as late as the s it would have cost the average weeks wages to buy one. Eating turkey at Christmas was popularised further by its most recogniseable literary reference. That of course came in  when Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol was published. The character of Scrooge famously sends his put upon clerk Bob Cratchit a huge turkey to replace his goose on Christmas morning. Post  food austerity changed any doubts about the correct choice for Christmas dinner. The sheer size of the turkey could more than adequately feed a sizeable family and the St Stephens Day leftovers could be turned into sandwiches, soup and stew. According to the British Poultry Council more than  million turkeys are killed every year –  million of those for the Christmas season alone. However that figure pales by comparison to the fact that in the U.S.A three hundred million turkeys meet their fate each year – mainly for Christmas and Thanksgiving. But outside of Ireland, Britain and America, turkey is not the favoured roast for Christmas Day. In Norway for example, the festive feast actually takes place on Christmas Eve and most around the costal regions of the country eat fish – mainly cod and haddock and a iety called lutefisk. Inland in Norway they opt for pork chops, specially prepared sausages and sometimes lamb. In neighbouring Sweden the Yuletide consists of a smorgasboard of caviar, shellfish, cooked and raw fish and cheeses. Further east in Ukraine people prepare huge broths crammed with meat while in the Czech Republic tradition decrees that the tree is not lit before Christmas Eve and is then followed by a dinner of fish soup, salads, eggs and carp. A macarbre tradition upheld by the Czechs is that the number of people at the table must be even, otherwise the person without a partner will die the following year. In Germany the traditions are much more straightforward with the Christmas Day feast consisting largely of wild boar or venison. Meanwhile in Jamaica, Christmas dinner usually consists of rice, gungo peas, chicken, ox tail and curried goat. Back in Western Europe, the Christmas dinner in Italy can last four over four hours. Most families will have seven or more courses including antipasti, a small portion of pasta, a roast meal followed by two salads and two puddings – then, cheese, fruit, brandy and chocolates. The Austrians take a more austere approach and on Christmas Day traditionally sit down to braised carp served with gingerbread and beer sauce. Poland pays no heed to the turkey at all. In fact they pay no mind to meat at all and knuckle down to  meat free dishes that represent the months of the year and which includes fish such as pike, herring and carp. Other typical Polish Christmas dishes are fish soup, sauerkraut with wild mushrooms or peas and traditional dumplings with ious fillings.

A few goals in a short space of time hindered the older married mens chance of getting a result, but to be fair, along with putting on a few extra men at times, they pulled back a couple of goals, but unfortunately it wasn’t enough for them, the singles men took the title and bragging rights for the first ‘singles vs married men’ game.

Cllr McPeake said: When I first came into council, this was one of the projects that I inherited, and immediately I sought to get some progress on, meeting with council officials about the possibility of a play park on the site as far back as January. We are all familiar with the many benefits reported from leisure facilities for children, particularly those which encourage outdoor activity, and I think it is important that we make delivery of these sorts of spaces a priority right across our council area. googletag.cmd.push If we are to tackle issues such as mental health problems and obesity, it is vital that we provide our young people with the amenities to allow them to get out and about, and play has been proven as a necessity for childrens development.He added: As part of this project further on down the line, I hope to see further car parking to alleviate the issues which exist currently in ONeill Park, and I will be making a case for delivery of this. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Workshops offered information and advice on funding, community led approaches to regeneration, tourism impact and sustainability and future-proofing historic town centres.Speaking at the event, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District, Councillor Michaela Boyle, said the conference generated conversa- tions about the importance of conservation and making the most of our heritage assets. “I was delighted that Derry was chosen as the location for this important conference. “In terms of our own considerable history and heritage it was particularly appropriate that it was hosted in our beautul Walled City.“In the past we have underestimated the importance and the value of our heritage and the unique appeal it has for visitors keen to learn more about le in one of Ireland’s most historic settlements. The conference offered the opportunity to find out more about the learnings of other historic locations and how they have successfully enhanced their own areas through conservation and regeneration.”Liz Bates, National Chair said: “The Heritage Trust Network were delighted to have the opportunity to hold our annual Conference in Derry-Londonderry this year. The hospitality we received from all local partners was so generous and welcoming, it was a pleasure to bring our members and supporters from across the UK to this historic city. We hope that all attendees went away feeling supported and enabled to revive their heritage in collaboration with their community and local businesses.”Director of environment and regeneration with Council, Karen Phillips, said it had been an informative and inspirational event. “It was really interesting to hear from some of the leading experts in their field on the development of heritage, and how conservation and regeneration projects can impact on the local economy. “We are currently exploring new ways of revitalising our urban and rural centres and using our particular heritage with a view to bringing more visitors to learn the unique story of the North West.“We have considerable assets, whichproperly utilised, could really build on our current and developing business and com- munity growth. The concept of community led tourism, engaging and involving local communities is also one which we are exploring. This has been a great opportunity for learning and exchanging ideas with other organisations tasked with preserving local heritage.” Helen Quigley, chief executive Officer with the Inner City Buildings Preservation Trust, and vice-chair of the Heritage Trust Network NI Committee, said it had been a great opportunity for delegates to hear from a range of experts about how heritage can help revive our city centres. “We wanted to use this conference as an opportunity to build on the excellent work we delivered as part of our  conference, Unlocking Prosperity through Heritage led Regeneration. The Heritage Trust Network conference has encouraged wider, strategic discussion around the sht from out of town retail back to the high street, built around businesses and the wider community working together. “It helped to highlight the signicant work currently under- way in the Walled City by ICBPT and its partners to instil pride in our historic environment, grow our tourism offer and importantly create employment.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The principal cast performed like seasoned professionals, bringing the iconic characters to le with flair and panache.Eoin McGuinness and Ellen McGurnaghan were outstanding in their comic portrayals of Gomez and Morticia Addams, while Annie Haughey and Eoin Moore were superb as the sinister siblings, Wednesday and Pugsley.The hilariously embarrassing grandmother was played by Aisha Oladipupo, and Year  student Conaire Laverty brought endless laughs as the grunting Lurch. Conn Murnin, as Uncle Fester, was a particular audience favourite and his departure on a rocket to seek the love of his le mdash the Moon mdash was a highlight of the show.The ever present long dead Addams ancestors were a tight and focused chorus including a stunning range of costumes from cavemen to flappers. All-American family, the Beinekes, played by Malachy McGrady, Elisha Tumelty and Tomaacutes Harkinleft the audience in stitches as they struggled to deal with ways of the weird and wonderful Addams family. All ended happily ever after, however, as both families moved towards the darkness and embraced who they really were.Featuring an exceptional live orchestra led by Head of Music Celeste McEvoy and music teacher Ciara Coleman, and with magnicent set, costume, lighting and sound complementing the breathtaking musical and dramatic talent of these students, it really was a show not to be missed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahich Post Office remains  ","story":"RESIDENTS in Ballynahinch will continue to have access to a first class Post Office service in the New Year after all.Days after it was suggested that the current office in Lisburn Street would close temporarily on January , it was confirmed this week that there will be no break in service.The current postmistress will vacate her position on January  with M Retail Ltd taking over the service the following day.Mrs Donna Carlisle mdash who is the current postmistress mdash said everything will continue as normal in the New Year and that there will be no interruption to services.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who said last week that it was his understanding that the Ballynahinch Post Office was to close temporarily, is delighted that normal service is to continue.He said post offices are at the heart of communities and are used by a wide range of people, in particular the elderly, who enjoy the face-to-face contact with staff.ldquoBallynahinch is the districtrsquos third largest town and I am pleased that there will be no interruption to postal services, he continued.ldquoMany elderly people prefer to conduct their business at post offices rather than banks.

The boys are all training hard and we are working on a few dferent permutations for the decider, but it will definitely be horses for courses.ldquoTony McIlhone, Jack McLaughlin and Adam and Gareth George will be key for us in the final. Their experience should stand us in good stead, but I have absolutely no doubt that our young players will rise to the occasion, he added.Fitzsimmons paid tribute to Gerard Kelly, who led the team, to Harry Clarke Cup success last season with Kieran Sharvin and who is still in the management team.ldquoIt is a pleasure and honour to work alongside Gerard, who puts so much effort into keeping the club going. We have been friends for many years and work so well together, he said.ldquoWe have come up with a few ideas on how to get at Ballynahinch Olympic, but we will leave that information to the changing rooms in Meadowvale.Barry McGoran and Marty Sloan have moulded Ballynahinch Olympic Town into a force to be reckoned with, despite the fact that they rarely field with the same  every week due to first team call-ups.As a reserve team, people tend to write them off in the big games, but theyrsquove consistently proved that theyrsquore good enough to compete with anyone.The squad has done exceptionally well to get to another final, but they wont be happy until they get our hands on the cup.McGoran and Sloan like to play the same way as Killough and use the tactic of attack being the best means of defence and Barry feels that Olympic arenrsquot far away from lting the trophy.ldquoWersquore only half way there and need to stay focused.

In addition, roads officials only have eight electricians to repair faulty street lights across the Province, with just five of these working full-time.The crisis facing street lighting repairs has been highlighted this week by South Down MLA Colin McGrath who has been contacted by many concerned residents across the constituency.He said that the government departmentrsquos failure to sanction work to repair street lights mdash which includes replacing faulty wiring and defective bulbs mdash is a major concern for many, in particular, the vulnerable and elderly.Mr McGrath said that while the issue may appear trivial and mundane to some, to a signicant number of others, itrsquos literally is a matter of personal safety.He said many are fearful of injuring themselves due to faulty street lights which plunge areas around their home into darkness.The MLA declared: ldquoThere is barely a street or road in South Down that does not have street lights which are not working. When there are several defective lights in a row, this creates problems.Mr McGrath said that he and his colleagues have been ldquoinundated with repair requests which are passed on to the departmentrsquos street lighting team.He said that while he is full of admiration for the local team who work tirelessly to resolve faulty streetlights in a professional and courteous way, they can only work with the budget they have been given, one which he said falls well short of what is required.ldquoI have written to the Department for Infrastructure and have found out that the budget for street lighting should be poundm a year. It is currently a mere poundm which is totally inadequate and falls well short of what the public expect, declared Mr McGrath.ldquoApparently, there are only eight full time staff managing the work of replacing and fixing street lights across the whole of North and this is wholly unacceptable. Eight staff from Derry toNewry, and Enniskillen to Ballycastle is not enough and represents a situation that demands action.The MLA confirmed that he has also raised his concerns with the permanent secretary at the helm of the government department asking that in the depths of winter and reduced daylight hours, additional funding will be made to address the issue.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are literally in the dark over what will happen next and need to see some solution to this problem.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed that officials have discussed the street lighting situation with Mr McGrath.ldquoWhilst we appreciate his concerns, we have explained that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continues to face budget challenges and resources are not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service, she continued.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos current budget for street lighting repairs is approximately poundm, which is much lower than the pound.m that would be required to provide a full street lighting repair service.The spokeswoman explained that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce, which consists of five full time and three part time electricians.She added: ldquoDue to the restricted service, outages may take much longer than usual to be repaired, with priority being given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Devaney.jpg","title":"Devaney elected as new chairman of Down GAA  ","story":"DOWN GAA elected a new chairman at the annual convention in Newry last Wednesday evening.

But it is only the only project.ldquoThere is quite a lot we can achieve in other areas, on and off the fields of play. Coaching, refereeing, administration, club development and fundraising will also require our attention, he added.ldquoAnd we also want to have the ambition for our teams to reach their potential and challenge for honours. So, the future has real potential for us, but it will require a lot of support, goodwill and a unity of purpose across the county.

Muriel worked in the office of the now defunct Ulster Transport company.They met on a bus from Belfast to Portaferry and the rest, as they say, is history.ldquoI think we were both on the bus from Belfast and my mother, who knew Muriel, sat beside her and they began to talk and then we were introduced, said Alan. ldquoI was sitting behind and my mother then invited her down for supper the next night.Muriel interjected jokingly: ldquoI was supposed to be going to a shorthand class, which would have made my dear father much happier, but I mitched off and went to the Ritz pictures instead.ldquoHis mother had already spotted me and approved me as a likely candidate for her son as she believed that I knew how to keep house since I was doing it at home as my mother died when I was very young.Alan said that his motherrsquos approval of Muriel very much matched his own.ldquoI had clapped eyes on her before and I thought she will do very nicely for me. It was a private thought, but my mother must have picked up on it and had some insight, he added.Muriel did come for supper the next night and an invitation to a dance was given by Alan. They courted for over a year and more whenever he was home on leave.Alanrsquos parents, Rachel and Ian, were in the next room when Alan later asked Muriel to marry him and they celebrated with tea and supper again.ldquoI was completely flabbergasted but I would say that it was a romantic proposal, recalled Muriel. ldquoAlanrsquos father was great at tending to an open fire in the sitting room and his mother was a great hostess in making scones and cake for supper, so I think just after his father tended the fire, Alan turned tome and asked me to marry me. I think I said yes with a laugh as it was so unexpected.The couple spent the early years of their marriage in Malta where Alan was stationed and where the eldest two sons where born.While the family spent a short time living in Bangor, they have spent the last  years living Downpatrick where Alan went on to work for Radio Rentals in the town, and later in the British Red Cross Society in Belfast, while Muriel worked for the Saul playgroup and later in Downpatrick Library.The couplersquos love of music and going to the theatre, both in Belfast, and at the former Theatre Upstairs, in Irish Street, Downpatrick, was a shared passion over the years.Even today, they both love to watch or listen to concerts on the radio or TV, with performances perking up them up from a trying day or calling on their Alexa to play some Glen Miller music.Muriel said: ldquoWe both love the theatre and we both absolutely love music of all sorts. If therersquos anything that doesnrsquot suit us, we have a wee word with Alexa and say itrsquos your turn to chose.Alan added: ldquoIrsquove often said isnrsquot it wonderful that we have the same tastes in common and thatrsquos a great start to a marriage as well as a good sense of humour and a short memory.Muriel said: ldquoI think it did help that we did like the same things but I would say donrsquot leave it too long before you say sorry for whatever may have happened or been said between you.

Cllr Enrightrsquos assertion has been rejected by council officials.ldquoThe long-standing plans to publicly finance the redevelopment of public lands in Downpatrick town centre have been abandoned, he claimed.Cllr Enright said business representatives who attended the meeting in Downpatrick were not informed that a proposed road linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue as part of a new one-way system was not proceeding.He said such a scheme mdash which roads officials have said is not viable given the cost and the small impact that it would have on congestion mdash would have eliminated the need for traffic lights on all the main junctions and ldquomassively reduced congestion around the centre of town.Cllr Enright claimed that when he queried the decision, he was informed that the councilrsquos priorities are the Ballynahinch bypass and Newryrsquos southern relief road.He added: ldquoAll this comes hot on the heels of the scandalous proposed closure of Downpatrickrsquos visitor information centre in favour of Newry, progressing greenways around Newry but not Downpatrick and the abandonment of the promised Edward Street one-way system, which was supposed to have been delivered on a short-term basis in  until the new council revisited the roads priority list.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman said the local authority has allocated poundm to the Newry City Centre regenerationproject, with poundm secured from the Belfast Regional City Deal, not the poundm quoted by Cllr Enright.She continued: ldquoIt has been proposed that the development of Downpatrick town centre and the old PSNI station should be done collaboratively between local and central government with intervention from other public sector bodies.ldquoThis remains the case. However, the one-way system for Downpatrick town centre was considered by Transport NI who have advised that this is not viable.The spokeswoman also confirmed that a report was tabled to the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourismlast month which considered the future opportunities for visitor information centres within the district.She added: ldquo This report was held lsquoin committeersquo and no decisions have been made by Newry, Mourne and Down Council with regards to the closures of existing visitor information centres.

As was that of SDLP runner-up Michael Savage.They were the only two South Down candidates who made their way to the podium to thank those who voted for them on a night when Northern Irelandrsquos political environment changed signicantly.With voters across the province electing a majority of nationalist MPs for the first time, it truly was a night of edge-of-the-seat political drama. Itrsquos often said that first itrsquos news then its history, but at the Belfast county centre news and history were inextricably intertwined.Minutes after the South Down result had been declared, the glare of the media spotlight was on official confirmation that the DUP had lost South Belfast.As SDLP supporters and the party faithful cheered loudly for Claire Hanna, the Sinn Fein contingent took a moment out of celebrating Mr Hazzardrsquos victory to watch proceedings.Hazzard was always the favourite for the South Down seat and used a sporting analogy to explain how he felt about the contest. He said favourites donrsquot always win, pointing out how hard he worked on the ground, emphasising that the was never complacent about the challenge he faced from the SDLP.From early in the count, SDLP members said that it looked as though their man was in with a real fighting chance and from the boxes which had been opened, the duo were neck and neck.While some of the Sinn Fein contingent appeared to be sporting furrowed brows early into the counting process, they were always confident that their man would emerge victorious and that he did, albeit with a reduced majority.There were suggestions that unionist voters in the Crossgar area had backed Mr Savage, who was clear throughout his campaign that he would not only be an MP for all, but one who would take his seat in the House of Commons.And while it was reported close between him and Mr Hazzard at one stage, the Sinn Fein man eased ahead in the race to cross the winning line, with the SDLP man left wondering what might have been.He had been given a relatively short lead-in time to last weekrsquos parliamentary pole and while pleased with his performance, he clearly felt he could have done even better and pushed the Sinn Fein man all the way to the line.Elsewhere, Alliancersquos Patrick Brown was one of a number of his partyrsquos candidates who built on their recent success at the EU and local council elections.The Westminster poll was viewed as a key litmus test that would rigorously challenge Alliancersquos recent election surge in a first past the post electoral system which did not rely on the votes of other parties.Mr Brown, who in May trebled his Newry, Mourne and Down Council vote in Rowallane, was at it again. His election agent and fellow councillor, Andrew McMurray, stood for Alliance in  and polled , votes, but Brown more than trebled the Alliance vote, a performance which helped his party leapfrog the Ulster Unionists to become the third largest in the province. Overall, Alliancersquos vote in South Down increased by an impressive . per cent, marking a remarkable performance by Brown.Most signicantly, Alliance now has its eyes focused firmly on securing an Assembly seat and while Mr Brown refused to be drawn on whether he would like his name to go forward should such a contest arise, there is no doubt that he will be the partyrsquos preferred candidate. He left the count centre a happy man his stock within his party continues to rise.Elsewhere, the DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna was pleased with his performance, despite his vote decreasing, and he didnrsquot rule out being the partyrsquos flag bearer in a future Assembly electionthis weekrsquos talks at Stormont fail to restore the power-sharing executive.Ulster Unionist, Jill Macauley, defied pundits suggestions that her party would not do well in South Down, by increasing the UUP vote by almost three per cent.Province-wide, the UUP polled , votes but with a new leader in charge the party did not produce the performance it had been hoping for.

I am so joyful and thankful as is my husband Dermot and our families.Orkambi was made available freely available following a surprise move by Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly at the end of October.Scotland and the Republic of Ireland made the drug free available to CF sufferers earlier but NHS England wrangled with the drug company over price.Once a deal was agreed in England, it paved the pay for Northern Ireland to introduce Orkambi for patients as young as Lorcaacuten, along with Symkevi, which can be given to children aged  and over.Jen was only informed on Monday that the drug was available for Lorcaacuten following a phone call from his treatment nurse.She said: ldquoI was absolutely shaking holding the phone when they told me that Lorcaacuten could get his medication as he has been fighting off the pseudomonas infection since last November.ldquoOrkambi was being given to those children with the higher clinical need and Lorcaacuten got it because of his infection, but I know of so many other families who have campaigned long and hard as we have.ldquoItrsquos just a matter of sufficient quantities of the drug becoming available as I know that the medical teams are working around the clock to distribute to as many patients as they can.Lorcaacuten was observed for five hours in hospital before he was allowed to go home with what his mother calls his ldquomagic medicine. He will need to take it twice daily from now as well as taking his antibiotics and being nebulised several times a day.However, Jen says that studies have shown that children with CF who take Orkambi from the age of six can live with the condition for an extra  years.ldquoThis is not just a Christmas present for this year, but for all the extra years we hope to have with Lorcaacuten, said Jen.ldquoWhilst I love Lorcaacuten to the bottom of my heart, these past three years have been very dficult.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

often I think it comes down to the mental approach, having the right focus to stay professional in your preparations despite everything  going on with the holiday season.“From starting out in management I’ve always had my teams in for a training session just ahead of Boxing Day, not so much for tactics or fitness but really just a way of getting the squad together for that final time before the match.“It helps keep everyone sharp and, hopefully, we can get the right result in Loughgall and end the year in top spot.“That is the target as you set goals along the way and sitting first at the start of the new year is a marker which can benefit the squad.”Portadown recovered from defeat to Ballinamallard United with a - success on Saturday over PSNI at Shamrock Park.A Lee Bonis brace alongside goals from Chris Lavery, Adam Salley and Callum Ferris secured victory.“We were - up at half-time but had kept moving the ball around and the final goal was the most pleasing in terms of representing so much of what we work towards,” said Tipton. “It came after a -pass team move - by moving the opposition and maintaining control, eventually players tire and that leads to extra space, which we can try to exploit.“The final goal was the culmination of that teamwork and it was pleasing to see the players still strive towards that at -.”\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"traffic update road closed major disruption expected ","story":"Return to top flight remains the target for Portadown says Matthew TiptonYour  calendar probably has a printing error -

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
