Outgoing North America editor Sopel is thought to have nearly doubled his BBC pay of up to £234,999.Newsnight presenter Maitlis is believed to have got a pay rise from her salary band of up to £329,999.

Photograph: John D KellyWhen word came through earlier this month, says Louise Tobin, there was “excitement and amazement” in the school corridors.St Joseph’s Primary School – along with four other primary schools in Tipperary Town - had finally secured long-awaited resources under the Deis (Delivering Equality in Schools) programme.“It was a battle, there’s no doubt about that, but we got the right result after six years of campaigning,” she said.“In September we’ll at last have the extra resources to enable our pupils and all those in the town to access a good primary education with all the extra resources and supports needed to bridge the gaps . . . We’re looking forward to a brighter future for our young children.”Over at Scoil Íosagáin Infant National School in Mallow, Co Cork, the reaction was very different.“Honestly, I cried for about half an hour,” principal Linda Dennehy said, after learning that her school had failed to secure Deis status.“It was that upsetting for a school like ours. We put so much work into contacting TDs, having questions raised in the Dáil, and highlighting the needs of our children.”She says it meant the school would not get access to training programmes for early literacy or numeracy programmes, or smaller class sizes. The needs are acute, she says, given that it has two special classes and enrols children from the local direct provision centre.“It was a shock not to be on the list . . . Our needs are very real, but it seems some areas are more favoured than others.”Reactions These contrasting reactions were shared across many schools when the Minister for Education Norma Foley announced an expansion of the Deis programme earlier this month.In all, some 310 schools’ students will benefit from additional supports – such as additional teaching posts, free schoolbooks and home supports for students – under the programmes.The €32 million expansion of the scheme means almost 1,200 schools attended by one in four students will have Deis status from September 2022.“This is the single biggest investment in educational disadvantage in the history of the State,” said Ms Foley, at the announcement.“Equality of opportunity in education must be a primary objective. Since becoming Minister, I have been very keen to ensure to the absolute maximum that we make available to our students that very opportunity.”The Department of Education says schools were identified through a deprivation index based on the census which captures a greater breadth and severity of disadvantage.However, the announcement has also sparked a wider debate about the Deis programme itself.While the 16 year old programme has been subject of a number of evaluations, some critics argue that no fundamental review and restructuring of the scheme has yet taken place. They argue that urgent questions need to be addressed.Is the Deis programme fit for purpose? Does it ensure all schools who need support get it? Is the attainment gap being narrowed sufficiently? And should the lingering effects of the pandemic prompt a rethink of how we tackle social inequality in education?Gap Latest available evidence suggests that Deis has been delivering results. Studies by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) show that while students in Deis schools had lower average scores in reading, maths and science compared with non-Deis schools in 2018, the gap has narrowed in key areas such as reading (See panel). Ms Foley said recently that the impact of the programme has attracted international attention from jurisdictions such as France, who have been impressed by the results and the targeted nature of the scheme.However, Prof Judith Harford and Dr Brian Fleming of UCD’s School of Education argue that while the evidence suggests progress has been made, it has been limited.“Our research indicates that the Deis scheme is grossly under-funded relative to the challenges faced by school communities in endeavouring to meet the needs of their students,” they say.“The scheme is also poorly structured in that it fails to address the particular organisational needs of schools in the scheme in any meaningful way.”Prof Selina McCoy and\u0026nbsppostdoctoral research fellow Eamonn Farrell of the ESRI also argue that key metrics – such as the gap in school completion rates between Deis and non-Deis school – have remained stubbornly persistent and, in fact, increased in recent years.They point to a recent ERC analysis which compared home and school learning environments, wellbeing, attitudes, and aspirations of 15-year-olds in schools.Students in schools in areas of socio-economic disadvantage were more likely to lose out on learning because of using alcohol and drugs, missing school without authorisation, and not being attentive in class.They also had fewer educational resources in their homes and were less likely to aspire to go to higher education.Identified A key argument is whether schools that reay need support are being identified – and whether the system is sophisticated enough to respond to inidual needs.The late researcher Trutz Haase, who helped devise the deprivation index which is used to identify schools in more deprived areas, argued that a sliding scale of support for schools was the best way to respond to educational need rather than a simple “in-out” scheme.Harford and Fleming also point out that, for primary schools in the programme, Deis operates at three levels or bands reflecting the scale of disadvantage evident in a school. No such system exists in Deis schools at post-primary level.“The notion that all post-primary schools serving disadvantaged areas are the same has always been absurd. The recent announcement doesn’t make clear whether this approach is being reformed or not. If the latter, it is extremely disappointing, given that the more detailed figures now available would facilitate such a move,” they say.Complex Educational disadvantage, however, is complex and intractable. Most agree that the Deis scheme cannot do the heavy-lifting on its own.McCoy and Farrell say that the difficulties of the Covid-19 period have highlighted the gap in students’ home learning environments which were more likely than the school learning environment to reproduce social inequalities.While almost all students will suffer some delay or loss of learning as a result of the pandemic, they say the level and impact of this delay or loss will generally be higher among those experiencing difficulties.As well as greater challenges in comprehending material without properly differentiated instruction, the lack of the non-academic features of the classroom has impacted more on those struggling with academic material.Deis schools, in particular, are on the front line in dealing with students’ issues in physical and mental health, housing, and poverty, but these issues cannot be solved by teachers or school leaders.McCoy and Farrell says that what happens in the classroom is unlikely to overcome what happens outside it when a child is waiting months or years for access to therapeutic supports, access to child and adolescent mental health services or suitable accommodation.“As a society, we must ask ourselves whether this is the level of funding we are willing to commit to tackling educational disadvantage in schools and, by extension, whether this is the level of inequality we are willing to tolerate,” McCoy and Farrell wrote, in a recent article for Education Matters Yearbook.“As we return to ‘business as usual’, it is vital that we repair the damage done by two years of unprecedented disruption. Yet we cannot simply accept the restoration of pre-pandemic levels of inequality either. Educational inequality is a systemic phenomenon and must be addressed structurally and not just in the classroom, be it physical or virtual.”Is the gap closing? Deis versus the rest The Educational Research Centre has produced a series of reports over recent years examining the performance of Deis versus non-Deis schools. These are some of the findings:"},{"url":null,"title":"ireland likely experiencing several hundred thousand covid 19 cases per week says donnelly","story":"Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly: ‘Extremely restrictive’ measures would be needed to contain highly transmissible BA.2 subvariant. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw The number of Covid-19 patients in hospital could top 2,200 within the next 10 days, Ministers believe, amid increasing pressure on the Government to re-examine restrictions.The Coalition is reluctant to reimpose any measures and currently intends to allow emergency Covid-19 public health laws lapse on Thursday.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said the extra transmissibility of the BA.2 subvariant means “quite extreme measures” would be needed to contain it.He told an online meeting of Fianna Fáil members on Monday night that there were likely several hundred thousand cases of Covid every week, with daily numbers several times higher than those being tracked by PCR and antigen tests.However, a stakeholders’ taskforce has written to Mr Donnelly seeking fresh public advice amid concern about rising case numbers.The Emergency Department (ED) Taskforce, which monitors overcrowding in hospitals, urged Mr Donnelly to convene “the necessary public health resources and advisors to consider any and all measures that may now be appropriate in order to provide an increased level of protection to health and social care service provision”.ModellingUpdated Covid-19 modelling has been sought by Government, but a senior source said that, based on an analysis of recent data, there could be a peak of 2,000-2,200 Covid-19 hospitalisations in the next seven to 10 days, and the figure would then “fall fast”.The ED Taskforce, which is co-chaired by the HSE’s chief operating officer, Anne O’Connor, and the general secretary of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, Phil Ní Sheaghdha, met on Monday.There were 1,624 people in hospital with coronavirus on Monday, of whom 54 were in intensive care units.Mr Donnelly said the transmissibility of the BA.2 subvariant meant that extremely restrictive measures would be needed to contain it, and said that he was told by chief medical officer Tony Holohan that extra restrictions of this level were not currently advised.Sources said he told the Fianna Fáil meeting that about half the 54 people in critical care units who had Covid were there because of the virus, and that about the same number were not fully vaccinated.On masks, he told the meeting that while the legal requirement to wear masks had been disposed of, the public health advice to do so had been retained.‘Well into April’HSE chief Paul Reid said on Monday the experience of other countries in Europe was that the current variant waned after a while, so that meant Ireland was likely to be dealing with the current wave of the virus “well into April”.He was speaking as the Department of Health announced that 39,561 cases of Covid-19 had been recorded in the last three days.While hospitals are dealing with the most severe effects from the latest Covid wave, it has had a knock-on effect on other sectors including aviation, with Dublin Airport experiencing long delays due to staff shortages.Its operator, DAA, said it had set up a taskforce to consider emergency measures including the possible opening of security desks on a 24-hour basis and speeding up the placement of new recruits.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"one third of naval service fleet to be decommissioned","story":"LÉ Orla: The age of it, LÉ Eithne  and LÉ Ciara means the department may opt to sell them for scrap although all three are believed to be seaworthy.The Government has decided to formally decommission three Naval Service vessels – one-third of the fleet – in the months ahead.The vessels, the LÉ Orla, LÉ Ciara and the Naval Service flagship LÉ Eithne, have been tied up for several years due to the lack of sailors to crew them.Various options are being considered by officials for the disposal of the vessels, which are between 34 and 38 years old. One option under consideration is gifting them free of charge to a friendly nation. Another is to sell them.Both options carry potential political pitfalls. In 2015, the Naval Service offshore patrol vessel, the LÉ Aoife, was donated to the Armed Forces of Malta, despite concerns expressed by Maltese sailors about its condition. It remains in service there.In 2016, the 42-year-old LÉ Aisling was decommissioned and sold to a Dutch company for €110,000. The company sold it on a year later for €473,000 to a company in the United Arab Emirates, which almost immediately sold it to a company in Libya for €1.3 million.It was then transferred to one of the participants in the civil war in Libya, in breach of a UN arms embargo, where it was rearmed and renamed Al-Karama.The Department of Defence later said it had no “trailing obligations” in relation to the vessel.Refurbishment neededThe age of the Eithne, Orla and Ciara means the department may opt to simply sell them for scrap, military sources said, although all three are believed to be seaworthy, or could be made seaworthy with a reasonable amount of refurbishment.The decommissioning of the Eithne, Orla and Ciara will represent the biggest single change to the Naval Service fleet for many years.A date has yet to be set for the decommissioning. A department spokeswoman said the three vessels “are now at end of life”.She said Minister for Defence Simon Coveney “has made a decision to dispose of these three vessels. The process to dispose of Naval Service vessels is the subject of ongoing deliberations.”The decommissioning is likely to mean the Naval Service will become, for a time at least, a six-ship navy. The Government has agreed to purchase two decommissioned inshore patrol vessels from the New Zealand navy for €26 million.The vessels, which require far fewer sailors compared to the outgoing ones, will be used for fisheries patrols in the Irish Sea. However, they are not due for delivery until 2023.Before they can be transferred to Ireland, they require a significant refit by the New Zealand navy costing between €10 and €12 million.Staff shortageA replacement is also planned for the Eithne in the form of a multipurpose vessel costing up to €200 million. The Government has said the process will take between four and six years to complete.The Naval Service is currently severely understaffed, resulting in the cancellation of multiple maritime patrols in recent years.The Representative Association for Commissioned Officers (Raco) said the outgoing ships “have given excellent service and have exceeded their service life” but that in the last two years have proved to be “little more than a drain on scarce maintenance and security resources”.Sec Gen Comdt Conor King said it was now time “to dispose of these vessels to free up resources to better support the remaining ships and to prepare for the entry into service of the new vessels.“In the meantime, there is a huge amount of work to be done to retain our naval personnel, and build on our depleted strength with fresh blood if the Navy is ever to be in a position to crew its fleet.”The recent Commission on the Defence Forces report recommended a significant expansion and modernisation of the Naval Service, which it said should be renamed the Irish Navy. Among the proposals was the operation of a 12-ship navy which could “provide the Naval Service with maritime capabilities for defending the State from a conventional military attack”.

I have not seen the sort of pragmatism and flexibility that would allow us to agree a deal.’  Photograph: James ManningPA Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis has played down the prospect of triggering article 16 and acknowledged Britain is legally obliged to carry out checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea. He told the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at Westminster the checks demanded by the Northern Ireland protocol are “legal requirements” and it was right they were continuing despite threats by DUP Ministers to halt them. “Of course, even taking those away doesn’t necessarily in and of itself even solve some of the issues that businesses are having,” he said. He said the reason Britain did not trigger article 16 was because the government was committed to reaching an agreement with the European Commission, adding that “Article 16 doesn’t scrap the protocol.” Mr Lewis is not directly involved in the protocol negotiations which are led by foreign secretary Liz Truss and European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic. He said he believed Mr Sefcovic was eager to reach a deal but that he was hamstrung by negotiating red lines set out by EU leaders. “I think he is someone who is pragmatic, he would like to try to find a way through this. But he is trying to work within a mandate and I think there is a real issue that the mandate from his point of view may not give him the flexibility to find a way through this so far,” he said. ‘Pragmatism and flexibility’“I have not seen the sort of flexibility from the EU that I would have expected to see. I have not seen the sort of pragmatism and flexibility that would allow us to agree a deal. Otherwise we would have agreed one by now.” Describing the protocol as unsustainable, Mr Lewis said it was not working for business and 200 companies in Great Britain were no longer shipping goods to Northern Ireland. The committee’s chairman, Simon Hoare, pointed out that trade from Great Britain to Northern Ireland had increased since the protocol came into force. Mr Lewis defended his government’s decision to renege on the protocol it had itself negotiated, which he said was undermining the Belfast Agreement. Trade declineIn a separate committee hearing at Westminster on Monday, chancellor of the exchequer Rishi Sunak admitted Brexit was causing problems for British businesses which trade with Europe. The Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR), an independent fiscal watchdog, said last week that trade as a share of the economy had fallen in Britain by 2½ times more than any other major industrialised country. “It was always inevitable that there would be a change in our trade intensity with Europe as a result of the change in trading relationship,” Mr Sunak said. “Without a doubt we are changing out trading relationship with the EU and that means a different set of controls and things that people will have to do. Obviously that will have an impact and I’m sure that’s a big part of the reason this is happening. It may just be a bit early to be definitive about which bits are doing what.” "},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics a disappointing patrick s day for the taoiseach covid s resurgence","story":"Hugh catches up with Pat Leahy, fresh from his trip to Washington for Micheál Martin’s ill-fated St Patrick’s Day visit.

It is the only known example in England.Opposite the garderobe is the niche for a toiletries cupboard that would have contained the king’s private articles.Henry III reigned from 1216 to 1272, more than 300 years before the first written description of a flushing lavatory and 500 years before Alexander Cumming was granted the first patent for a flush toilet.The precise mechanisms of the flush remain unknown. It may have involved some kind of automated mechanism or it could have been as simple as a servant on the roof above the lavatory tipping over a bucket. Water would have been collected manually from the well within the tower walls and carried to the castle roof.The conservation project, one of English Heritage’s largest since a new bridge was installed at Tintagel in Cornwall, is part of what Mr Ashbee dubbed a trend toward “sensitive contemporary conservation”.“This is quite a conservative repair,” he told The .The architects and English Heritage were insistent that the ruination of the tower not be altered, hence the large hole in the centre of the deck that ensures the interior remains open to the elements.It also led to the selection of clearly modern materials, including glue-laminated timber, steel and LED lighting.Hugh Broughton, who designed the timber deck, said it was about “not trying to pretend that it\u0027s something that it isn\u0027t” by disguising the modern work as medieval.The deck, which balances on four immense wooden columns, does not exert any structural load on the tower walls.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Met Police to issue 20 fines over \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 scandalPrince Philip’s thanksgiving will be the service the Queen wanted a year agoPrince Philip’s memorial service latest news: Queen travels to Westminster Abbey with Prince Andrew Royal family will not wear military uniforms at Duke of Edinburgh’s memorialPrince Andrew travels with Queen to Prince Philip\u0026#39s memorial service at Westminster AbbeyDuke of Edinburgh’s Award star to pay tribute to way he changed countless livesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"post covid education policy requires ambition","story":"Given the impact of the pandemic on our children’s schooling, a new plan for education is an important policy document. A white paper published yesterday contains a set of ambitions that can hardly be considered contentious. It wants “strong schools with great teachers” and “standards that will improve children’s education, deliver the right support if they fall behind and give them the tools to lead a happy, fulfilled and successful life”.It is hard to imagine any strategy that would not cleave to such aspirations. The issue, as it always has been, is how to make them a reality.The vehicle for meeting them is an expansion of so-called multi-academy trusts (Mats), with all English schools expected to be in one or have plans to join or form one within eight years. Each trust will have about 10 schools and 7,500 pupils and there will be protections for selective schools, though no removal of the ban on new grammar schools.One point about academies was to remove schools from local authority control and yet councils will be able to set up their own Mats. Areas of the country where the main barrier to improvement has been the council are unlikely to benefit.The white paper envisages schools providing a minimum of 32.5 hours of schooling a week (inevitably opposed by the unions) when arguably it should be longer to help the Covid generation catch up. There is much in the strategy to show parents the Government is intent on pushing up standards. Whether it is ambitious enough to repair the damage caused by the pandemic lockdowns is another matter.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Roman Abramovich pictured at fresh peace talks weeks after \u0026#39poisoning\u0026#39Politics latest news: Met Police to issue 20 fines over \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 scandalPrince Philip’s thanksgiving will be the service the Queen wanted a year agoRoyal family will not wear military uniforms at Duke of Edinburgh’s memorialPrince Andrew travels with Queen to Prince Philip\u0026#39s memorial service at Westminster AbbeyMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"do you think people stupid","story":"Do you think people are stupid : Chancellor Rishi Sunak savaged over disastrous mini-BudgetLabours Siobhain McDonagh laid into the \"fiscal illusionist\" Chancellor over his Spring Statement, which experts say will leave . million Brits facing absolute povertythis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video rishi-sunak-grilled-mcdonagh-over-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:YgyaerOb,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,prebidUseTestRuntime:true,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mantisRecommender.recommenderMaxMpuNumber:,mantisRecommender.autoplayInterval:,nonIframeMantisRecommender:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,amp.trackonomics.enabled:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,mantisRecommender.useIntTracking:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,authUI.default:true,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,adServedMastheadStripEnabled:true,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,mantisRecommender.hbEnabled:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,amp.stickyAdRefresh:,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,M.apiUrl:https:partner-widget-api-prod.tm-awx monitizer  compare prices gbp_en,publicationName:Mirror,mantisRecommender.limit:,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,authUI.version:ffefdecbcae,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,trackonomics.id:reachplc_cDEYX_mirror,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],video.ctpFloatAndPark:true,felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,convoStarterEnabled:true,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank branded the minister a fiscal illusionist after experts calculated that last weekaposs Spring Statement was set to raise taxes on Brits to the highest since Clement Attlee. Speaking to MPs on the Commonsapos Treasury Select Committee, Mr Sunak accepted poorer households would face the pinch and he may have to intervene to stop them being clobbered by higher energy bills again in October. He was also forced to admit he does not live up to his reputation as a tax-cutting Chancellor. Iaposve not actually said that, he said. What Iaposve said is that Iaposm a Chancellor who has had to deal with a pandemic. He insisted that by the end of this Parliament, I want taxes to be going down not up. Households are braced for the biggest fall in living standards since the s as Covid, the Russia-Ukraine war and spiralling inflation take their toll.Labouraposs Siobhain McDonagh took the Chancellor to task over tax hikes and his decision to delay a p income tax cut to  has been branded as a general election gimmick.I wondered why this particular date was decided andyou believe itaposs good economic management for a Chancellor to determine his fiscal policy decisions around the general election cycle or do you think it just makes people more cynical about politicians , she asked. He said the timing was chosen to signal the direction of travel, adding itaposs not until uncommon for Chancellors both on the business tax and on the personal tax side to announce things a year or more in advance. Do you think people are stupid , Ms McDonagh replied. Do you not think people will see through that  The government has refused to row back on plans to hike National Insurance and drag more people into higher income tax bands. Letaposs do the maths though, when you add up all the proposed tax increases and subtract your future to income tax and National Insurance threshold pledges, said Ms McDonagh. The net result is a .% rise in the tax to GDP ratio between   and  . Is that really a cause for celebration   Mr Sunak said the tax rises were a reflection of the fact that spending on public services was rising.He said: So, as public spending rises as a share of the economy. unsurprisingly, related to that the tax burden is rising to pay for that public spending. Thataposs whataposs happening. and the reason thataposs happening is because we have stuck with ambitious investments in public services at a time when the economy is suffering from the effects of Coronavirus, and therefore, rather than cut public spending, weaposre raising the taxes to pay for it.He also claimed to drive an ageing VW Golf, after he was ridiculed for posing for pictures at a petrol station using a Sainsbury workeraposs Kia Rio. Asked what car his family used, he replied we have a golf before adding the Kia Rio he used for the publicity shot actually was an employeeaposs at Sainsburyaposs. He also faced anger for not doing enough to help low income households cope with rising energy bills. The Resolution Foundation found that the Spring Statement will leave . million Brits, including , children, facing absolute poverty this year. The think tank also calculated that a typical working-age household will see their real income fall % next year - a loss of £,, the Resolution Foundation think tank said. The Resolution Foundation also warned the Tory Chancelloraposs £bn in cuts to National Insurance and fuel duty will also mostly benefit people in work. Mr Sunak said the Government cannot compensate everyone for the squeeze on living standards and claimed it would have been “irresponsible” to have increased borrowing more. The committee chairman Mel Stride said the Chancellor had done “very little” for those who were out of work and relying on benefits. Mr Sunak said: “If someone’s view is Government can or should make everybody whole for inflation – particularly inflation at these levels caused by global supply factors – then that’s something that I don’t think is doable.” He said that raising benefits by the current rate of inflation rather than what it was last September would have added £ billion to Government borrowing in the period up to -. He said that “irresponsible” borrowing levels risked stoking inflation even further adding to the pressure on living standards. “We are already forecast to borrow in this coming year about % more as a percentage of GDP than our post-war average, % more as a percentage of GDP than we were forecast to borrow in October, so it is already a signicant amount of borrowing,” he said. “My view is an excessive amount of borrowing now is not the responsible thing to do.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Spring StatementSiobhain McDonaghLiving standards\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite told the Government that the firm would not U-turn on the decision to fire hundreds of seafarers to replace them with cheaper agency staff. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps gave the firm an ultimatum to rehire staff on their previous wages or face consequences.But the PO boss wrote to Mr Shapps claiming his request ignores the situationaposs fundamental and factual realities. Re-employing the sacked workers on their previous wages would deliberately cause the companyaposs collapse, resulting in the irretrievable loss of an additional , jobs, the letter said.  I cannot imagine that you would wish to compel an employer to bring about its own downfall, affecting not hundreds but thousands of families. When PO Ferries announced its decision to replace its crews with cheaper agency workers, it stated that the business needed to cut costs to survive as it was losing £ million a year. Mr Hebblethwaite also rejected Mr Shappsapos request that Thursdayaposs deadline for sacked workers to accept redundancy offers is delayed, as more than  of the  affected people have taken steps to accept the settlement offer. He wrote: These are legally binding agreements, and crew members who have entered them will rightly expect us to comply with their terms. He also resisted calls for him to quit - despite Mr Shapps describing his position as untenable. Mr Hebblethwaite wrote: I am fully cognisant of the reputational cost to the PO Ferries brand and me personally. That notwithstanding, I am compelled to discharge my duties for this historical company, saving the jobs of the , dedicated employees who continue working for PO Ferries and providing for the effective operation of the trade routes upon which this country depends. It comes after he admitted to MPs last week that the firm chose to break the law by failing to consult staff and unions before sacking staff by Zoom call.The ferry boss also confirmed the average wage among aposreplacementapos employees on PO vessels will be £. an hour - well below the minimum wage. The chairmen of the Commons’ transport and business select committees urged the Government to strip PO Ferries of its licence on Monday.Tory MP Huw Merriman and Labour MP Darren Jones wrote: “Our immediate concern is the welfare and employment rights of the  seafarers made redundant by PO Ferries.“Government has not moved sufficiently quickly to support them.

The beast then chomps down on his catch as Samuel tries to wrestle it from the monsteraposs powerful jaws.Eventually, the fish was taken and Samuel left empty-handed – although the thrill of the experience left him more than happy as he shrieked with delight when ing to his boat. It turned out the creature was an Atlantic goliath grouper, one of the largest species of bony fish on the planet.Capable of growing to s of more than  metres, the monster fish have also been known to eat sharks in one gulp. And, unsurprisingly, viewers were absolutely petried by what they witnessed. Nah I would have cut the line man, one wrote. Another commented: Would be so spooked to get the line wrapped around something and get pulled deep. And a third said: Dude you just caught one of the biggest fish ever. Theyaposre known as goliath groupers and their mouths open to x their body meaning they eat sharks.  Itaposs not the first time a clip of a Goliath grouper fish has gone viral. Back in , footage of a great white shark battling the sea monster stunned the internet. And another clip emerged back in  showed a man getting sucked underwater by the fish. Earlier this month, the body of a rare shark born when King Henry VIII was on the throne was found off Britain. The Greenland shark which has the longest known lespan of all vertebrate species between  and  years was spotted by a walker on a beach at Newlyn Harbour near Penzance, Cornwall on Sunday, March . Cornwall Wildle Trustaposs Marine Strandings Network was contacted and arrived at the beach within an hour but the tide had come in and washed the shark back out into the sea. This sparked an urgent appeal to search for the shark. A crew from Mermaid Pleasure Trips found the shark and took it ashore. Marine Strandings Network thanked the crew for their efforts. They said: We are absolutely delighted to update you that the superb crew from Mermaid Pleasure Trips, Penzance, Trev and Kingsley, this evening found and brought ashore the dead Greenland shark which previously stranded on Sunday and then washed back out to sea.

Kilo was found in Huyton, near Liverpool, by Dogs Trust Merseyside after his former family abandoned him near to a busy road having decided they couldnapost cope with him anymore.The brave Staffordshire Bull Terrier was accompanied by his food and water bowls, while a note gave his name and explained his owners could no longer care for him.He is believed to be around six years old, reports the Liverpool Echo. The charityaposs team has been hit hard by the ordeal and are desperate to find Kilo a new forever home. He is slowly building a bond with the likes of carer Chris Furnell who has been temporarily looking after him.  Kilo is not yet ready to play with toys but is becoming accustomed to having a fuss made of him. His carers are confident his true personality will eventually begin to shine throughhe can find a loving new home. Charity manager Georgina Lowery said: “It is so sad and shocking when this happens.  We found him at around pm and we are just so grateful that he hadn’t managed to pull himself free, especially as we are near a busy road. He is a gorgeous boy but understandably a little nervous given what he has been through. As nobody has come forward to claim him he is now ready to find a new home. The fact that Kilo was left with his food bowls and his owners told us his name and left a note, show they cared about him, but we would always urge anyone needing to give up their dog to contact us, however dficult. That way we can find out as much as possible about the dog which helps us find them their ideal home as quickly as possible, and of course it means we can avoid unnecessary suffering and distress to the dog. As no one has turned up to claim Kilo, the team at Dogs Trust are now seeking a new home for the lovable terrier. They seek an adult only home where he is the only dog and with no visiting children. They say that whilst he builds his confidence, he will benefit greatly from patient owners who can afford him the space and time to allow him to settle in and trust again.If youaposre interested and fit the description of the ideal owner, you can find Kilo at www.dogstrust.org.uk Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON AnimalsDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The house which has been boarded-up for decades sits right next to railway tracks in the Midlands. Now covered in graffiti and long-forgotten posters, the puzzling property with a skinny structure is located in Earlsdon, Coventry.It can be revealed that the house which - was formerly a car showroom and then a carpet store, - was out-of-use because it was too close to the railway tracks to be safe, Coventry Live reports.That is not all, eagle-eyed residents thought that the property on Albany Road, appeared to have no door.  But, upon closer inspection, the door is hidden behind graffiti.Network Rail cleared the mystery up when CoventryLive approached them to find out more.The house was actually bought by the network at the turn of the century. Resident Mary Courtney wrote: This strange little house with the steeply slanted roof looks like a Su Mo painting. It has never in my memory been occupied. I wonder what its story is.

The woman, who wishes to simply be known as Caroline, captured video footage of a vast amount of flies in her neighbouraposs window and shared it on social media. She has hit out at Sovereign Housing - the association responsible for her block of flats in Bristol. Sovereign said in a statement that Carolineaposs neighbour has been confirmed to be safe and well following a welfare check. The company will be visiting the property today with Environmental Health to investigate the cause of the flies.Caroline told Bristol Live she had ed home at am on the morning of March  to find what she describes as hundreds and thousands of huge blue bottle flies inside her neighbours flat window, all trying to get out. She believed she probably hadnapost noticed it sooner because the weather hadnapost been warm or sunny before that day.She added: I knew something was dead in that flat and I have also not seen the owner for two years. I alerted Sovereign but got the standard email reply back that they have two weeks to even read the email. I have been woken at night by these huge horrible big flies in my bedroom lounge upstairs. There are three of us living in a two bedroom flat and I sleep in the lounge where I have made a little room for myself at the end. They frighten me because I donapost want them anywhere near me or my children. We just donapost seem to be getting any better and the stress of being ill and the constant cleaning, hoovering and washing is so exhausting. The children cannot attend school due to being so unwell and Iaposd personally like to thank Bristol Cathedral and Bristol Cathedral Choir School for their wonderful safeguarding advocates for contacting Sovereign Housing early this week as Sovereign had said it was a lease holder issue and they couldnapost get involved.  Back in January, Bristol Live reported on how terried Caroline had been after discovering rats in her flat - and how she had even resorted to cooking on her balcony to avoid attracting them. At the time, Caroline told Bristol Live that upon reporting it to the housing association, she was told they could find no evidence of rats.She said: I think itaposs pretty disgusting to say thataposs the end of it for us because there is no evidence, and yet youaposve got somebody whoaposs living here saying, aposbut they are in my ceilingapos. She later bought an endoscope camera and poked it through a hole in her ceiling and eventually captured on of the rats on video. At the time, Sovereign said they wanted all customers to feel safe and secure in their homes which is why weaposve arranged a number of visits from pest control firms to our shared ownership properties on Hotwell Road. Until very recently, we had not been provided with the video footage which could show where the rats are getting into the building, and we’re hopeful that this will help nail down the point of entry. We’ve been working closely with an officer from Bristol Environmental Health to resolve the issue, putting bait down around the scheme, since this was reported to us in November . We are also scheduling an independent appointment with a second pest control agency, which is due to take place as soon as possible. After Bristol Liveaposs report, Caroline said there seemed to be some action on Sovereignaposs part especially after Environmental Health also stepped in to help me in my plight to prove I was plagued with rats. She also described how Sovereign allowed Ecolab to have three visits but said: You canapost treat pest control effectively in three visits. Eleanor Lowman, regional home ownership manager at Sovereign, said: “We’d like to thank Caroline for expressing concern for her neighbour who we’re pleased to confirm is safe and well.“We’ll be visiting the property tomorrowwith Environmental Health to investigate the cause of the flies and to seek a resolution.“We’d always urge residents with concerns about the welfare of a neighbour to check on them, report it to us or ask the Police to do a welfare check.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Ecolab Inc.Public servicesHousing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Natalie Warke, , repeatedly rammed her VW Golf into her sisteraposs empty car before pushing it across a junction during a family row. Warke was arguing in the street with her eldest son and her sister about her vehicle being pranged. Stunned passers-by watched as she argued with her relatives in the street. Police were called to the scene in Levenshulme, Manchester found Warke slumped at the wheel of the car having snorted cocaine in the run-up to the incident, Manchester Crown Court said.  According to court documents tests showed she had mg of Benzoylecgonine- which is the main metabolite of cocaine - in her blood and she also had traces of cocaine itself in her system. The limit is mg. Warke admitted dangerous driving, drug driving, and having no insurance but walked free after a judge accepted a prison stretch would have a aposharmful effect on her -year-old son. The incident happened at am in May  when Warke got into a row with her sister and other relatives after one accidentally hit her car.  Warke had been diagnosed with epilepsy following a car crash in , the court heard. Andrew Mackintosh, prosecuting, said: This defendant was seen coming to a halt at a junction before driving into a small vehicle parked at the roadside. She pushed it back for a little distance then reversed and drove off only tofrom the opposite direction and push the other car across a road junction. The defendant was seen to get out of her vehicle and there was a disturbance involving other people and that resulted in her getting back into the car. Police arrived at the scene and found her sat in the driveraposs seat. She appeared to be slurring her words and was gurning at the officers who thought was intoxicated. Whilst they asked her for her keys, a member of the public approached them and showed CCTV of the incident. When interviewed the defendant accepted she had deliberately driven her Golf into the vehicles of other family members. She said this was following an argument with her son and several other members of the family. She admitted having driven into the parked car several times and said this was due to her son crashing his car into hers a short time before the incident. This is a case where some damage would have been caused to the other vehicle - however, the other members of the family who own that vehicle have never made a complaint or provided details of what happened. Warke had previous convictions for theft, the court heard. In mitigation defence counsel Andrew Molloy said his client is a single mum and has a son with special needs. Mr Molloy: She is somewhat embarrassed about her performance that day. This incident arose out of an argument and domestic tf she had with her sister. She thoroughly regrets her behaviour. Whilst what happened was unacceptable, there was no persons in the other vehicle and she was alone in her car. There were no pedestrians in the vicinity and very little in the way of traffic passing along the road. If she were to go to custody there would be repercussions for her son. Sentencing Warke, the judge Mr Recorder Michael Armstrong told her: You made a choice to drive whilst under the influence of drugs along a public street before ramming another family memberaposs vehicle on a number of occasions. But immediate custody would have a signicant harmful effect on others in particular your -year-old son. Warke was sentenced to nine months in jail suspended for  months and was ordered to complete  Rehabilitation Requirement Days. She was also banned from driving for two years.

If a person is supervising a driver who is learning, they could be hit with £, fine - as well as a massive six points on their licence. Current rules under the Highway Code make texting or calling while driving illegal. But new rules brought in on Friday means many grey areas have been tightened, making more actions illegal. In , it was ruled in the High Court that an offence was committed when a mobile was used for an interactive communication .  This included calling or texting, but now using a phone for any purpose, is seen as reckless and dangerous. Now drivers can no longer touch their device, take photos or videos, access playlists or use other apps while they drive. Phone use at traffic lights or in motorway queues will also be seen as illegal under new Highway Code rules. Anyone using a device while driving faces a £ fixed fine plus six points added to their driving licence. Motorists are, however, permitted to use their phones to pay at a drive-thru restaurant or a road or bridge toll. The Department of Transport : There will be an exemption to the new law for drivers making a contactless payment using their mobile phone while stationary to ensure the law keeps pace with technology.This exemption will cover, for example, places like a drive-through restaurant or a road toll, and will only apply when payment is being made with a card reader. It will not allow motorists to make general online payments while driving. Hands-free devices can be used when driving including taking calls or using a satnav, but onlyit is secured in something which holds it.

CVS employee Mariah took to TikTok and revealed that she has seen customers printing off their private snaps at nine in the morning on the storeaposs printing facilities. Unfortunately, it means that she and the storeaposs other employees have to see the full brunt of the clienteleaposs private lives, the Daily Star reports.This is even worsean order is placed online, as Mariah has to sort through the pictures and make sure the right ones get printed out. She told her TikTok followers of her dilemma, donning her red unorm and yellow lanyard for the video.Where do you print your pictures  Let us know in the comment section  Mariah, from New York City told viewers: I donapost know how many times I have to say this. Donapost print your nudes at CVS.I do, in fact, see every single one. The -year-old worker joked about calling out one of her customers in particular, commenting: Please it’s am Lauren I can’t do this. Some viewers were shocked to find out about the shopaposs printing service, with one commenting: So CVS saw my daughteraposs entire birth.I left my sister in charge of pictures with a disposable camera. I had no idea until I went to pick them up at CVS and saw all the workers face.

When the Duke of Edinburgh, the beloved husband of the Queen, died last April aged , England was still in the grip of restrictions due to the Covid- pandemic. This meant his funeral, held on April  at St Georgeaposs Chapel in Windsor, was a much scaled-back service, with just  guests and no singing by the guests. It had been Philipaposs express wishes for the congregation to join and sing the rousing hymn Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer at his funeral.  Although the hymn was sung by a small choir, guests at his funeral were not allowed to join in. However, today, this request will finally be fulfilled at todayaposs service when the ,-strong congregation sing the hymn. In addition, Philip, who worked on his own funeral details – codenamed Forth Bridge – for many years, had asked for the choir to sing Te Deum in C by Benjamin Britten, and this will also be part of Tuesday’s proceedings.

Meanwhile, clergy from Windsor, Sandringham and Balmoral will all play a special part in the service - at Philipaposs request. Philip had an active role in the day-to-day management of the estates for many years. He wanted the minister of Crathie Church near Balmoral, the rector of Sandringham and the chaplain to the Royal Chapel of All Saints, Windsor Great Park, to take part in his funeral - but Covid restrictions could not allow this.  Nearly all members of the Royal Family will be attending todayaposs event, including Prince Andrew, who will arrive alongside his daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, and their husbands Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi and Jack Brooksbank. Also there will be Prince Charles, Camilla, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Earl and Countess of Wessex and their children Lady Louise Windsor and Viscount Severn, the Princess Royal and Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence, Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, the Duke of Kent and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester.  However, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are not ing from the US for the service.Around  foreign royals will attend, including Prince Albert of Monaco, Denmark’s Queen Margrethe and Spain’s King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia, who would have originally been on the pre-pandemic guest list.

The scene was caught on camera by a passer-by and heavily-bleeped footage was shown in court. Prosecutor Ashley Petchey said three protesters were sitting across the road and queues of traffic had built up behind them.  Speid got out of her vehicle and remonstrated with the demonstrators, the court heard. A woman is seen telling the protesters they must move out of the way now and my son needs to go to school and I need to go to work. She also says: My son is  and he needs to go to school. Of the dangerous driving count, Mr Petchey said: It is not an excessive speed as the driver was using the brakes quite heavily. This is done on two occasions.  The Range Rover stops very close to the female protester. Mr Petchey said the dangerous driving meant that injury could have been caused. He said: Clearly this was an incident where there was a risk, evenno injury was caused. An assault charge against Speid, in which it was alleged that protester Bethany Mogie had been beaten, was dismissed after the prosecution said it would produce no evidence.The prosecution said it would ask for £ in costs and a pre-sentence report was ordered. Peter Hoche, chairman of the bench, unconditionally bailed Speid to next appear at Basildon Magistratesapos Court on May  for sentencing. He also banned Speid from driving by issuing her with an interim driving disqualication. At the height of the Insulate Britain road-blocking protests, Speid attempted to move the activists with her Range Rover.  “What they’re doing is wrong, she said afterwards. They’re not peaceful, they’re obstructive and they’re rude, she continued. I’m upset I lost my temper and maybe I could’ve gone about it in a dferent way but I will always stand up for what I believe in — that people should be entitled to live their normal lives. She said at the time that she was standing up for other mums who needed to take their children to school in the mornings. Insulate Britain has demanded that the government invest money in making Britainaposs homes less leaky and cold, in a bid to save energy and therefore protect the environment.

The Maritime and Coastguard Agencyhas said after undertaking a safety inspection it was in the process of holding The Pride of Kent on Monday.The firm sparked outrage with protests at ports around the country after getting rid of  seafarers without giving notice on March .PO boss Peter Hebblethwaite will appear before a Scottish Parliament committee on Tuesday, after he was heavily criticised over the job cuts.Now a spokesperson for the MCA confirmed that the Pride of Kent was being held.  They said: Our surveyors are in the process of detaining the Pride of Kent. We are awaiting confirmation of all the detainable items.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed the news in a tweet, adding that the ship was being held following an inspection and that safety will not be compromised.It follows the detention of another PO vessel which was held in the Northern Ireland port of Larne on Friday due to failures on crew familiarisation, vessel documentation and crew training. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union said it believed the MCA acted because of multiple safety and operational breaches, including the wearing of breathing apparatus. The union repeated its demand that the Government seize POaposs entire fleet and take action to get them back in service with the sacked crew reinstated.  General secretary Mick Lynch said: The seizing of the Pride of Kent by the MCA this evening should be adequate evidence for the Government that the gangster capitalist outfit PO are not fit and proper to run a safe service after the jobs massacre. Itaposs rare enough for the MCA to impound a ferry but PO have now had two in a week after the jobs carve up which speaks volumes about the dire state of their operation. Itaposs now high time for these important vessels to be taken over under public control with the sacked crews reinstated as the only way to get these crucial ferry routes back running safely. The MCA said another of the firmaposs vessels, European Causeway, remains under detention in Larne. Shapps wrote to Mr Hebblethwaite earlier on Monday threatening to bring a package of measures to Parliament to block the company from paying below minimum wage. Through that package, I intend to block the outcome that PO Ferries has pursued, including paying workers less than the minimum wage, he said.  The measures could be unveiled on Wednesday. The minimum wage in the UK for people aged  and above is £. per hour. Mr Hebblethwaite, whose basic annual salary is £,, told MPs on March  the average pay of the agency crew is £. per hour. He will face the Net Zero, Energy and Transport Committee on Tuesday after he appeared before a Westminster committee last week. Irish Ferries began operating on the Dover to Calais route in June  in competition with PO Ferries. A PO Ferries spokesman reportedly said: We fully welcome the Governmentaposs commitment to increasing the minimum wage for all seafarers working in British waters. From the outset, we have called for a level playing field when it comes to pay and conditions on British ferry routes. Our announcement is not about reducing seafareraposs wages, it is to enable us to have a fully flexible crewing model that allows us to meet the demands of our customers. The predicted savings we announced are not solely coming from the reduction in wages, but from removing job duplication and the benefits we will see from increased flexibility.

With the Omicron iant giving rise to sub-iants like stealth Omicron and Deltacron, and ious symptoms becoming linked to the dferent iants of the virus, it can be hard to tellyouaposre suffering from Covid or just a cold.Knowingyou have Covid or a cold has become particularly dficult because the Omicron iant has symptoms that y from the classic three signs of Covid and instead overlap with symptoms of a cold. However, experts have identied two early signs that points towards you having Covid. What two symptoms are early signs of Omicron   Two early signs of Omicron, that are dferent to the main symptoms identied by the NHS, have been identied as fatigue and dizziness or fainting.Fatigue is not just feeling tired. It can be accompanied by other symptoms like headaches as well as body pain due to weak or sore muscles. Sometimes it even leads to blurred vision and loss of appetite.Dr Angelique Coetzee, who was the doctor to first raise the alarm on Omicron in South Africa - where the iant was first discovered in November  - also highlighted fatigues as one of the main signs of Omicron.  The second early symptom of Omicron is dizziness, which could potentially lead to fainting. This connection between fainting spells and Covid was first noted by a German newspaper Arztezeitung. The possibility of fainting being a Covid symptom was first discovered by doctors in Berlin, who found that Covid was triggering recurrent fainting spells in a -year-old hospital patient. What are the common symptoms of Omicron  According to the NHS, the main symptoms of Covid are still a high temperature, a new continuous cough and a loss of taste smell. However, the signs of Omicron have been found to be vastly dferent from the classic three signs of Covid established previously. A study in the infectious disease and epidemiology journal, Eurosurveillance, identied eight key symptoms of the Omicron iant. These included cough, runny nose, sore throat, headache, muscle pain, fever and sneezing. Of these the first three symptoms were found to be the most common.What to doyou have Covid   According to government advice, you are no longer by law required to self isolateyou test positive for Covid.However, the NHS still recommends you stay at home and avoid contact with othersyou have symptoms. The advice currently states: While you’re no longer legally required to self-isolateyou have Covid-, you should try to stay at home and away from others to avoid passing on the virus.The NHS recommends you stay away and avoid contactyou have any of the main symptoms of Covid- or have tested positive for Covid-. It is recommended you take rapid lateral flow tests from five days after your symptoms start, and the next day. If both your tests are negative and you donapost have a fever youaposre less likely to pass on Covid to others.

Maps from WXCharts show temperatures getting colder as the week goes on and spreading further south. It could get as low as -C in central Scotland while it could also be -C on the south coast of England. There are likely to be widespread snow flurries on Thursday morning, with it sticking in the South East, according to the maps, and again on Saturday where there could be up to six or seven centimetres of snow in North Wales and northern England.  Met Office forecaster Aidan McGivern said: “Much colder weather is on the way and in places there will be snow by the middle of the week.”He continued: “Another area of rain pushing south across the Northern Isles, that is a cold front and it is going to be an important feature over the next few days as it sweeps south across the country. Shetland already in the Arctic air.” It is set to be a cloudy and grey start to Tuesday morning for the east of England and rain in the north and south.  “This area across Scotland mixing with cold air could bring some sleet and snow over the high grounds but that again is a fairly weak feature, said Mr McGivern. To the north of it though much colder air arrives, C to C in the far north of Scotland while temperatures stay above average further south although not as high as they have been with a lot more cloud cover than we have been used to recently. It will get a lot colder, though going into Wednesday. Here’s the cold front by Tuesday night it has become an increasingly important feature as it potentially reactivates with the cold air to bring some snow fall to places by Wednesday and Thursday, said Mr McGivern.  For the start of Tuesday night we are going to see a lot of cloud cover, some cloud, mist and fog in place and here’s the cold front, you can see some snow on it over the Pennines, rain mainly at lower levels. It is slowly sinking south but it’s iding the country in two with a frosty start for Scotland, in parts of the far north of England behind the front, and milder further south albeit with a cloud cover and a few bits of showery rain in places. UK forecast for the next  days Turning much colder and also more unsettled this week. Today: Occasional rain across southern England clearing slowly. Fog and low cloud in central areas retreating to eastern coasts, sunny intervals and scattered showers inland. Rain moving southwards into Scotland, followed by colder weather with wintry showers in the far north. Tonight: Rain and hill snow sinking further south, followed by snow and hail showers in north and east Scotland, with a risk of ice. Further south mostly dry and cloudy. Wednesday: Rain and hill snow continuing southwards bright but distinctly cold to the north, with heavy hail and snow showers. Parts of Wales and southern England seeing sunny intervals and showers. Outlook for Thursday to Saturday: Cold for all parts with rain, sleet and snow clearing south on Thursday morning. Further wintry showers for many parts through Thursday and Friday.

Washing machines quite obviously have the purpose of washing our clothes, but have you ever thought about the fact your washing machine needs to be washed too  No, I hadnapost really, either, until cleaning queen Faith Earle shared a hack on Facebook for cleaning the little drawer where the detergent goes. As someone who officially fits into the category of people who hate cleaning, it had never occurred to me that the drawerwould need to be cleaned, let alone how I would do it. However, Faithaposs recent post revealed something that lots of us didnapost know - you can actually remove the entire drawer to clean it properly, and have a good scrub around behind it. Taking to the Facebook group Cleaning tips and tricks with before and after pictures of her drawer, Faith wrote: How on earth did I not know this drawer came out !Iaposm now officially an adult and love cleaning haha! Thank you everyone for your cleaning tips and tricks. So, I decided to take a look at my own washing machine drawer, and letaposs just say the results were slightly horrying. Just like Faith said, it turned out there was a little button that allowed me to pull the drawer out completely, and what was hidden behind was an awful lot of mould and filth. I decided to soak the drawer itself in hot, soapy water, before giving it a good old scrub - but washing compartment where the drawer had been was a lot harder. To be perfectly honest, as someone who doesnapost really subscribe to the whole Mrs Hinch lestyle, I wasnapost really sure how to tackle it, but some boiling water, washing up liquid and a toothbrush made it a lot more presentable for now. Itaposs quite grim to think about all the mould that was sitting in a machine which is supposed to leave things cleaner - not more dirty - but until someone invents a self-cleaning washing machine, letaposs spread the word on keeping that pesky drawer clean.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

However, she knew she couldn’t justy spending so much on a vase, so set about thinking up a creative - and very thrty - solution.NHS nurse Teresa, from Essex, decided to try making her own vase using something of a similar shape that she already had knocking about the house – a normal bottle of Lenor Outdoorable Fabric Softener.The end result, which set Teresa back a snippy £, looked as on-trend as anything you might find in the shops, saving her £ when compared to the pricey one sheaposd seen online.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Teresa began by removing both the label and lid from the empty bottle, before using spray paint to give it the exact colour she wanted. She then wrapped string around the bottle top so as to hide the tell-tale grooves, before leaving it to dry. Guests would probably have no idea as to the cheap and cheerful origin of Teresaaposs fashionable, patterned vase unless she told them so herself, with her creation perfectly complimenting her stylish home decor.Teresa said: “I knew exactly which bottle I would use – I just love the pattern on them. [...] “I already had the empty bottle but they are usually about £ in the local supermarkets.“I picked up a £ can of  Natural Hessian chalk spray paint from Poundland. The string I already had, but you can usually pick that up for £. By making my own vase I saved myself £. She continued: “I absolutely love it. The string on the neck and the Natural Hessian colour gives it that rustic look, while the pattern effect on the stylish column silhouette adds elegance.Shared photos of the finished look via a Facebook post, Teresa wrote: “I love the patterns on these Lenor Outdoorable fabric softener Bottles from @joyofclean so I thought, why not get out the spray paint, some string and make myself a nice decorative vase.“Obviously it may not be to everyone’s taste but I love the patterns on it and I really like how dferent it looks from a normal vase. I’m going to try it with other shaped bottles that we throw away and see how they turn out. Facebook friends admired her inventiveness and were wowed by the very professional-looking end result. One person commented, “Absolutely gorgeous!!! I often wondered what you could use these bottles for. Brilliant idea, while another wrote, “I love this, it came out so beautully. A third said: “That’s lovely! I must try this thank you, I would love to try the stone effect spray paint on it too.Do you have a money-saving hack to share  We pay for stories.

Doctors once again prescribed Nicola steroid creams, and despite providing some initial relief the eczema proved more stubborn. “I started researching on my own because what the doctors could do wasn’t working at all,” Nicola said. I had some really aggressive, painful patches and I didn’t realise it was eczema again. The steroids took away the eczema almost immediately, but would always come back more aggressive.“I used things like shea butter, jojoba oil and vitamin E oil on my skin instead of moisturisers with chemicals in them and these helped a lot. “I was learning a bit more about alternatives to synthetic treatments, but hadn’t learned about topical steroid withdrawalat this point, so still used the weak steroids.”In January , she discovered people on Instagram who had been documenting their journey with TSW – an adverse reaction to discontinuing steroids after a period of usage. As she wasn’t using very strong steroids, Nicola thought that the condition wouldn’t affect her, so she continued to use her medication. But struggling to cope with the painful condition, she decided to stop using the creams once and for all in November . Quickly, her skin deteriorated dramatically. Nicola said: “I started to flare, ooze, crack, swell and bleed within a few days of stopping.“Initially, it felt like out-of-control eczema and just kept spreading, then within a couple of days the other symptoms started. “My skin would ooze wherever I had patches of inflamed and painful skin, which eventually ended up being most of my body after a couple of weeks. “I was aware [of the symptoms] because of the people who decided to document their healing process online, but I was convinced my withdrawal wouldn’t be that bad.“It was so incredibly dry, that I could barely move my joints and I couldn’t fully close my hands, bend my knees and elbows or even turn my head because my neck would crack, bleed and ooze. “My body stopped regulating its temperature, so I’d be sweating when I wasn’t hot and I lost my appetite, where I lost lbs.” Nicola began losing her hair and believes she lost over half during her ordeal, which she cut short due to it being so thin.  As her ears used to crack and ooze, they would end up sticking to the pillow and because her skin was so itchy, she couldn’t find a comfy way to sleep. Although she didn’t feel great about her appearance, her mental health has taken the biggest toll. Nicola said: “I was in so much pain and discomfort and just wanted my skin to feel better again.“I would happily look like this foreverI could just feel better. Obviously I’d rather not have all my skin open for the rest of my le, but at the time I’d have taken any relief. “It was without a doubt the worst experience of my le, as it was incredibly traumatic and there was never a single second where I felt comfortable or pain free. “I didn’t want to deal with it and looking back on it, I have no idea how I actually got through it – especially because I had no idea when it would end.“I barely left my house during the worst, but I was asked a couple of timesI was contagious and was told by the doctor that I looked like I had ‘elephant skin.’ “My partner, Jack Jones, , has been amazing and is one the reasons I managed to make it through each day. “He was basically my carer when I lost the ability to do most things, as he washed my hair, helped brush my teeth and bandaged me every night without fail.“I have a lot of sympathy for those [caring for others with TSW] because it isn’t easy watching your loved one go through such a traumatic experience.” Nicola believes that the experience has made self-acceptance easier for her and as she’s now  months free of steroid use, she feels more comfortable in her looks than ever before. She added: “Right now, my skin is better than it was before and even though I have scars and wrinkly skin, I think I look absolutely fine.“I still get flare-ups of dry, itchy skin in the cold weather which scares me and I start to worry I’m going to go through it again. “I don’t blame doctors and I know that’s a common feeling, as they’re doing what they were taught to do – but it annoys me when some refuse to listen. “Steroids have always been the treatment for eczema, so it’s hard to change minds, but all they have to do is look at how many people have gone through this and got better by doing nothing to our skin. “It isn’t a coincidence that we all get better eventually once we stop steroids, as topical steroid withdrawal isn’t eczema.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Jack JonesMental healthVitaminsElephantsSteroidsHealth\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily health briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It comes after reports the Cha FC owner has been flying between Moscow and Kyiv to relay messages between Putin and Zelensky. After relaying a message to Putin about potential terms of a peace agreement, Putin reportedly told Abramovich apostell him I will thrash themapos.Last week, the Kremlin has confirmed outgoing Cha owner was involved in early peace talks following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, reports the Mail Online.President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into the neighbouring country in late February, starting a bloody conflict which has been condemned by the vast majority of countries around the world.The war in Ukraine led to heightened scrutiny of Russians living in the United Kingdom on so-called aposGolden Visasapos. Abramovich was one such oligarch with assets worth billions in the UK, so claims he was playing a part in initial peace negotiations were met with surprise.Those reports were not backed up by Russian government officials at the time but a Kremlin spokesperson has now confirmed the -year-old was involved. He did take part at the initial stage, Dmitry Peskov, Putinaposs press secretary, said of Abramovich on Thursday. Now the negotiations are between the two teams, the Russians and Ukrainians.Abramovichaposs mother, Irina, was born in Ukraine and his daughter, Sofia, has posted on social media to declare it is only Putin who wants a war with Ukraine.A spokesperson for the Cha owner - who bought the club in  and is now selling up - released a statement four days after Putinaposs invasion which said: I can confirm that Roman Abramovich was contacted by the Ukrainian side for support in achieving a peaceful resolution, and that he has been trying to help ever since.Considering what is at stake, we would ask for your understanding as to why we have not commented on neither the situation as such nor his involvement. Thank you.Abramovichaposs role in the early peace talks was also confirmed by Ukrainian film director and producer Alexander Rodnyansky, who said: I can confirm that the Ukrainian side have been trying to find someone in Russia willing to help them in finding a peaceful resolutionThey are connected to Roman Abramovich through the Jewish community and reached out to him for help. Roman Abramovich has been trying to mobilise support for a peaceful resolution ever since.  Although Roman Abramovichaposs influence is limited, he is the only one who responded and taken it upon himself to try. If this will have an impact or not, I donapost know, but I am in contact with Zelenskyaposs staff myself, and know that they are grateful for his genuine efforts.Russian officials have also hit back at Joe Biden ’s jibe that “butcher” Vladimir Putin “cannot stay in power” by branding the US leader “weak, sick and deluded”.Moscow deployed its loyal attack dogs on Kremlin-controlled TV to claim the US leader should undergo a “medical examination” because he is incapable of “soberly” assessing reality. Putin’s own spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: We donapost know what President Biden meant, we know what he said.  “And what he said in general in his speech suggests that he is a victim of numerous delusions.”Speaker of the Russian parliament Vyacheslav Volodin branded Biden a “weak and sick man”, guilty of “hysteria” by branding Putin a “butcher” for the bloodshed in Ukraine.He said: The US president’s behaviour might be “professionally explained by psychiatrists” but “from a male point of view, the weak behave this way. “US citizens should be ashamed of their president. “Perhaps, he is sick.

It’s value before the recent slump due to the war and sanctions was around £. million. Luiza, a student, is the daughter of cleaner-turned-multimillionaire Svetlana Krivonogikh, , now part-owner of a major Russian bank, one of the countryaposs wealthiest women with an estimated £ million financial and property fortune. She has not commented on claims that her daughter was fathered by the Kremlin president, and nor has Luiza, also known as Elizaveta, although the teenager told Russian GQ that she “probably” looks “similar” to a young Putin.The suspicion that she was Putin’s secret daughter from an extra-marital affair was first aired by an independent media outlet in Russia which was later blocked by the authorities. The , square feet apartment in the sumptuous gated Fontanka  block is one of St Petersburg’s most sought after addresses in the city’s “Golden Triangle”. It is described as a “club house” with an array of “elite apartments” with construction by German company Engel  Voelkers, with “high-end” designer finishes and furnishings by Roberto Molon in an elegant and light art deco style”. Plumbing and kitchen appliances are from leading German and Italian manufacturers”.  In the prestigious development “everything is thought out to create maximum comfort, convenience and a fabulous atmosphere of beauty, comfort and coziness. “It has its own wellness centre with a swimming pool, and luxury service.” It offers “palace luxury in the spirit of modernity from Italian designers”. Reports say that Oleg Yemelyanov - linked to jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny - analysed hacked Yandex Food records which became publicly available.  These showed an unknown apartment linked to Krivonogikh at Fontanka embankment number , he said. “Wow, Putin’s [ex-]mistress Svetlana Krivonogikh has a flat with total area of nearly  square metres on the River Fontanka embankment,” said Yemelyanov. “Thanks for the tip to Luiza Vladimirovna [Rozova] who has been ordering food to that address.” The propertyaposs value has sunk to £. million in the past month. Luiza has closed her Instagram after she was hit by a wave of extreme trolling over Russia’s war in Ukraine.One comment said: “Are U sitting in the bunker   Like a rat ” Luiza - who had , subscribers - stopped publicly posting six months ago, triggering the suspicion that Putin had gagged her, but her account remained open. Now a message says in Russian: “User not found.”  One post on the -year-old’s Instagram alleged she was the “daughter of a murderer, war criminal, psychopath and drug addict”. Many posts included the Ukrainian blue-and-yellow flag and one carried the message: “The Russian nation must rise against this dictator. You donapost want to have anything to do with him.” But commenters also staunchly defended her, with one saying: “Donapost judge her...is not her fault.” Another wrote: “She cannot do anything for having a crazy father”. One more said: “Come on guys, she is just a person. She is not guilty.”  But a commenter called Martina hit back: “Yes, she is guilty of passive complicity. It is the same as most of the Germans in the Nazi period.” Another posted: “Call him -he loves you ... maybe you can convince him not to kill.” One complained: Stop writing [that] sheaposs an innocent. “She is the daughter of that devil! “She could at least show that she does not agree with what her father is doing, somehow influence him. “Putin doesnapost give a s*** for ordinary people, but maybe his daughters still mean something to him. “She stays quiet because she knowsshe says one bad word to Daddy, she will be cut off from big money, apartments and expensive things.  “Unfortunately, there are important things - and more important things. “Apparently, purses and villas are more important to her than human le.” Putin has two daughters by his ex-we Lyudmila, the former Kremlin first lady. Likewise, neither of them - Dr Maria Vorontsova, , a geneticist, and Katerina Tikhonova, , a high-kicking ‘rock’n’roll’ dancer-turned-mathematician, have commented on the war. There are reports that Putin has hidden some family members in a chalet in neutral Switzerland - while another version is that they are in a five-star hi-tech nuclear bunker in Siberia. There is speculation he has up to four children with Olympic Gold-medal winning rhythmic gymnast Alina Kabaeva, , now high-earning a media mogul in Moscow who is rarely seen in public. This would make the Kremlin strongman a father of seven. Luiza has had a higher online public profile, and was hit by a backlash over Ukraine.  One comment said: “How are you in the bunker ” A troll suspecting she may be in her mother’s Mediterranean bolthole said: “While you’re fluffing around in Monaco, people of your generation are dying in Ukraine because of your father. “Your destiny will be that of Marija Milosevic when your dad gets sent to The Hague. “SHOW YOUR FACE YOU COWARD!” She was told: “Young Russian soldiers are being sent to Ukraine without any knowledge about where they are, who they fight and what they do. “The Russian economy is collapsing, reaching absolute zero. “Soon,not already, you wonapost be able to use Netflix, Spoty, social media apps, pay with Google and Apple Pay, all popular brands and boycotting and exiting Russia.”Luiza was also told: “Many Ukrainians have forgotten about what sleep is, and even more so in bed. “After all, falling asleep, many of us run the risk of not waking up. “People spend the night in basements like rats because bombs are falling from the sky and rockets are coming. “All you need is not to be silent, not to stand aside. “ Tell people the truth about what is happening in Ukraine! “We want to live in peace and sleep peacefully in our beds, to know that in the morning our relatives and friends will be alive.” Luiza earlier showed her le at cafes, on trips to Paris, and running her own Russian fashion label. A video shows her at the Louvre museum during the pandemic. She was also seen working as an in-demand DJ.

The trio suffered symptoms including red eyes, painful tearing and peeling skin following their meeting in Kyiv. The professor warned that chemical weapons could also be used by Russia to break the stalemate in Ukraine. He added: However implausible a biological or chemical attack once seemed, the United States and its NATO allies need to game out the worst-case scenarios, take inventory of the resources they have at their collective disposal to deal with biological and chemical attacks, and swtly bolster those resources.Just a few weeks ago, the notion that Russia might use such weapons in its campaign in Ukraine would have seemed unduly alarmist. That is no longer the case.  Prof Osterholm added that Putin also aposseemingly has no compunctionapos about using banned weapons against his political enemies. The academic said biological and chemical weapons can achieve in war what bombs and bullets cannot - by reaching civilians hiding in shelters. He warned that poisonous gas could leave areas of Ukraine uninhabitable, while weaponised diseases could spread across the world. It comes after Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned with Novichok - just like former Kremlin spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia.  The father and daughter were attacked in Salisbury in , while Mr Navalny was poisoned in . In , Putin critic and ex-spy Alexander Litvinenko died in London after being poisoned with radioactive polonium-. Now Cha owner Abramovich, , has allegedly been poisoned while taking part in Ukraine peace talks. The suspected attack has been blamed on hard-liners in Moscow who wanted to foil talks to end the war.  It remains unclear what has caused the symptoms, which may have been triggered by a chemical or biological agent, or a form of electromagnetic-radiation attack. An investigation into the incident was launched by Christo Grozev and a German forensic team was brought in to perform examinations. However, too much time passed between the initial poisoning and these tests, so the suspected poison was unable to be detected. Mr Grozev concluded that the attack was a warning rather than an attempt to kill negotiators. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here Mr Abramovich - who took over at Stamford Bridge in  - is said to have travelled back and forth from Moscow, Lviv and other negotiating venues as part of his role in talks, which his spokesperson confirmed on  February. I can confirm that Roman Abramovich was contacted by the Ukrainian side for support in achieving a peaceful resolution, and that he has been trying to help ever since, a statement read. Considering what is at stake, we would ask for your understanding as to why we have not commented on neither the situation as such nor his involvement. Thank you.

From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#. The -year-old explained: #I think pilgrimage is about clearing out your mental closet by physical exertion and by spiritual conversation with yourself or,you believe it, then conversation with your God.#I know I come across as all sort of flouncy and floppy and rather cavalier, but I am capable of existing in the real world.#However, I don’t think I’ve walked so far not wearing Cuban heels.#Pilgrimage: The Road to the Scottish Isles will be screened on BBC Two and iPlayer in the spring with three one-hour-long episodes, and is a CTVC production."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 11 2022","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Who am I  What am I  Where am I  How am I  – questions of identity and some of the questions I was left asking when I left a recent meeting.That meeting was part of a world-wide movement – a movement that calls the peoples of the world to pray.Similar questions of identity were raised when I was asked to write ‘a piece’ for this newspaper.

But I cannot so easily answer such questions about you for I don’t really know who reads this column.Identity, human identity, all of us wrestle with questions of identity – from the inidual to a community to a nation or a race.Who are the Scots  Who are the Ukrainians  Who are the Russians  Where do you come from The answers are never as simple as we think they might be or would like them to be.Humanity is such a erse and multi-faceted part of creation.In recent weeks, many have tried to understand why the world finds itself on the potential tipping point of another large-scale war.In part, it is to do with identity – a simplication, I know – and a greed for power, land and wealth.Doomsters will shake their heads and wring their hands in despair, offering little hope.Politicians will talk and negotiate and may God bless them as they do!What will you do Your response will reflect something of your identity.Will you identy with a world-wide movement and pray for the well-being of the world "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 18 2021 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 2 3 2 3 2 2 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.It is getting no easier to plan and oversee public works these days.Council staff are to be congratulated for keeping the ious Mid Argyll projects broadly on track in the face of sharply rising costs and many other issues.We now look forward to the ious projects # and the Tarbert Harbour Authority scheme # coming to fruition.The generosity of Argyll folk in responding to the crisis in Ukraine is remarkable, yet not surprising. Time and again that spirit is demonstrated when the chips are down.It is just so upsetting to see what is happening to a modern European nation, and by giving so generously, perhaps this allows us to feel we are helping in some way.There is space in Argyll for refugees, andUK red tape would allow it, they would undoubtedly be warmly welcomed in Argyll and Bute.Armed Forces Day has been one of the most colourful days of fun in our calendar over recent years.

victory over the Aberdour seconds across in Fe.Taking advantage of the wind at Silversands, Kilmory pushed ahead with two well-taken quickfire goals from Alex Cunningham on  and  minutes to take an interval lead.There was no more scoring in the second half with both teams struggling a bit on the  sticky pitch.With Inveraray seniors# Mowi National Division match against Skye called off due to heavy rain # after the Aray lads had reached Fort William # Inveraray juniors had the option of a strong bench for their Mowi South Division Two match versus newly-formed Strachur-Dunoon.The match was reversed from the Winterton to Dunoon Stadium with the more experienced Inveraray side running out - winners.Experience aside, the Inveraray side still contained five players under  and one -year-old.A competitive and hard-fought game started at a good pace with Strachur-Dunoon showing good hitting and a willingness to chase down balls.Inveraray struggled for cohesion and had to wait until the th minute to find the breakthrough, Allan MacDonald scoring with a shot from distance.This settled the visitors and in the nd minute after some hard work by Ryan Pugh, the ball broke to Ewan Donnan, who struck from the angle to find the net.No sooner had the dust settled than Inveraray found themselves three ahead when Craig Taylor found space to put the ball past Dunoon keeper Nathan Ross.The second half was a closely-fought affair with both teams playing good, clean shinty.Inveraray had to step up a few gears to keep Strachur-Dunoon at bay, bringing on Colin Campbell, John MacKenzie and Allan Cameron to ensure composure throughout the team.Good second-half performances from all the Inveraray youngsters ensured the game was safe before Inveraray#s Allan Cameron finished the scoring in the th minute.This was the first competitive match for Strachur-Dunoon, and with a number of players missing # others having not met before the game # they showed plenty of determination, which bodes well for the future.Kyles Athletic#s away tie with Kilmallie in the Mowi Premiership was a Saturday morning postponement.The Kilmallie squad had already planned to attend the funeral of club chieftain Hugh #Shep# MacIntyre ahead of the game as the club paid their respects to one of their stalwarts.In Mowi South Division One, Kyles Athletic juniors drew -

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll boosts oban ahead of slockavullin final","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA group of five young Mid Argyll rugby players were in action last weekend as part of Oban Lorne under-s in the semi final of the West Youth Shield.The result of the match on Sunday March  didn#t go their way, as opponents East Kilbride ran out  #  winners, but it was a good contest and close game until Oban players sustained a few injuries and East Kilbride scored a couple of breakaway tries.Oban Lorne and the Mid Argyll contingent # Rhys Coffield, Murray MacDonald, Vinnie Buckley, James Campbell and Sorley Self # have had a great season, winning their West under- development league, so there is plenty for the lads to be proud of.If anyone would like to enjoy some rugby this weekend, Mid Argyll under- boys will be playing on Saturday March  in the final of the West Youth Chairman#s Trophy against Kilmarnock RFC at Slockavullin.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous.

I had slowly started to think that it was a once-in-a-letime opportunity until fortune smiled upon me one more time.About two weeks ago, I had a busy day at work. To recharge my batteries, I decided to go on a quick walk with the camera.Short-eared owl. Image: Zan BlaszczykAs soon as I left the house, the weather changed its course and the sky was shortly covered by nimbus clouds. Normally I wouldhome and grab my raincoat, but I did not want to waste time.When I arrived at the local reserve, the first rain droplets fell on the ground and the place became deserted. I took a wander and soon spotted a familiar flight pattern above the marshes. Upon checking through my camera, I confirmed it was a short-eared owl.The bird was flying low and patrolling the ground for voles. It even managed to catch one but it was tricky to get a good-quality photo due to the distance between us. The bird flew past me on a couple of occasions but the weather was getting worse with every minute so I headed back home. The word about the owl must have spread, as when I ed two days later, I met other fellow photographers looking for the stunning bird.I ed to the same spot as previously and sat on a rock and waited patiently. Shortly afterwards, a graceful owl with a wingspan of around cm appeared on the horizon. Without changing my position, I started following the bird with the camera. Imagine my surprise when the owl flew over me and looked straight at the camera! I silently shouted to myself: “Wow!”As soon as the owl flew behind me, I slowly turned back and spotted the second bird. Both owls were flying towards each other and, as they met halfway, they started their ‘sky dance’.The male began to rise in the sky whilst performing a combination of dynamic wing beats and gliding down, then rising again. He also made several squeaky calls accompanied by dynamic wing claps at high speeds! After repeating the whole sequence a few times, he started falling from the sky. The female joined in and they started going at each other: the birds were e-bombing one another and attacking with their talons. That aerial display lasted for about  minutes until the birds separated. What a scene it was!Courtship behaviour is spectacular for this species: often, two birds will lock their talons and, whilst holding onto each other, they will start tumbling nearly to the ground before letting go.I encourage everyone who has a chance to observe this behaviour, as this is a ‘must’ in the birding world. It is worth remembering, though, that this species is sensitive to disturbance and their numbers are considered declining during the past two decades. It is crucial not to approach the owls or their nesting site. For your observation, I would recommend choosing one spot and remaining there. This way, you have a chance to show them that you are no threat to them and hopefully the owls will get used to your presence. I prefer this technique rather than hiding as, considering owls’ excellent eyesight, it is almost impossible to stay unnoticed. By waiting at the same position, we can also eliminate another factor, which is chasing off their prey: as we walk, the ground shakes under our feet and small mammals, such as mice or voles which the owls feed on, will disappear. Short-eared owls like marshy and boggy places, so it is important not to walk over the rich habitat but use paths.www.zanslenswww.facebook zanslenswww zans_lensIf you have owls living in your backyard or would like me to photograph and feature wildle from your area, please get in touch!"},{"url":null,"title":"brunton-musselburgh-children-star-bugsy-malone","story":"Youth acting group Drama Mill auditioned  children for the show, and now has a cast of  children from North Berwick, Aberlady, Gullane, Cockenzie and Haddington, aged from eight to .Linda Kearsley Ross, Drama Mill director, said that the performance – the group’s first foray into musical theatre – was “ambitious” but that the children had loved taking on the roles of s New York gangsters.County children to star in Bugsy MaloneShe added: “Bugsy Malone was our first choice of play.“Drama facilitators Claudia Overton and Stephanie Wynne and I have all taken part in productions when we were at school and have fond memories of performing this play.“It’s ambitious to do it with such a young castbut our fabulous talented group have risen to the task.“This is the first time we have performed at The Brunton and we are so excited to give our youngsters the opportunity to perform on a professional stage.”The cast will perform the famous musical numbers accompanied by a live nine-piece band, whose members are all volunteering their time and talent.Drama faclitator Stephanie Wynne coaches the young Bugsy Malone castAnd the production will emulate the original  film, starring Jodie Foster, by using splurge guns and foam pies.Linda said: “There is something really fun about playing gangsters and molls, and using splurge to take people down rather than bullets.“Some people criticised that the ending is really abrupt, i.e. that they all become friends and sing a song, but I don’t think children question the ending – they believe bad people can become good people and that, as the words say, ‘ you give a little love then it all comes back to you’.”Tickets can be bought via    or thebrunton en-GB shows bugsy%malone events -

Allied with nearby communities showing similar ambitions, the group is breathing new le into the Firth of Clyde.Over % of the producers are led by female entrepreneurs, a fact that was celebrated on International Women’s Day this year. Isle of Bute Gin Distillery, Braw Liquor Club, Isle of Bute Coffee and the Isle of Bute Smokehouse are among the businesses challenging preconceptions about island living. Recently Highlands  Islands Enterprise provided funding for Bute Kitchen to train and retain hospitality talent, encourage the younger generation and support those looking to change careers or start their own business post-pandemic.“What Bute Kitchen does is it provides an epicentre on Bute for people to collaborate and an opportunity for producers to get to trade shows, get to market and promote what they do. There’s the concept of farm to table producers but there is also the idea of making sure that service matches the produce so that covers the work we are doing in hospitality on the island” explains Cathleen Crichton-Stuart.For the last two years, she has been involved with the collective through her work with the Isle of Bute Smokehouse, which changed name this year to attune with its strong island identity.The oldest fish smoking kiln in Scotland sits in Rothesay, the largest town on the island and a holiday resort that’s rediscovering its relevance. Peter Barr founded the smokehouse in , producing traditional kippers that were sent all over the world – there’s also a story that the west coast favourite made it to Queen Victoria’s breakfast table at Balmoral.In the s, the Ritchie family switched the focus of the business to smoked salmon. Following the Ritchie brothers’ retirement, the company was bought by Cathleen’s father, the late Marquess of Bute, and the smokehouse was extensively refurbished, building a food processing facility around the Barr kiln.“The spirit of collaboration is extremely strong. I see that as a board member of Bute Kitchen but equally as one of the producers. It’s been uplting to see the friendships and collaboration developing. We all want the Bute name, the island, to be associated with really high quality” Cathleen says.The smokehouse continues a local tradition that has been passed down from generation to generation. “The Barr family had a specic recipe that was used for dry curing and smoking fish. That same recipe was passed down to the Ritchie brothers. The Bute family bought the business off them about  years ago. My dad didn’t want that recipe to disappear. It’s lovely because the Ritchie family still come in at Christmas and help us at our busiest period” Cathleen says.“Our head smoker, Alasdair, is really fantastic for the job, he’s an avid fisherman and passionate about what he does. One of the key dferences between us and other smokehouses is that they use field drums to smoke the fish while we are one of the few that have a traditional kiln. We also use sugar in our cure as well as salt. The fish is hand-sliced and it really is an artisan product.”The supply of fresh fish is brought over from Dunoon, practically close enough to see the smoke signals from Bute, “when the weather is wild its easier with the ferry so we can always get our fish” Cathleen explains. “Kippers have been hard to get in the past  months, which is a problem everyone has had but hopefully that will be easier in future.\"The oak-smoked salmon and our smoked trout are our two core products. They are also my two favourites. I think it speaks to the quality of the process that the simplest product is the one that is hard to beat.”Campbell MacFadyen is the development chef at Mount Stuart, the Gothic stately home that is a Bute tourist attraction and a showcase for local produce. He has been on the island for the last seven years and has seen how the passion of producers has revitalised local le.“Mount Stuart was a founding partner of Bute Kitchen and we have seen how we are stronger together than we arewe are trying to fight our battles alone” he says. “I think there’s some fantastic produce and a real drive from the producers to grow. I think this is going to be the year where we can really promote the local food and drink that we have.”The house has  acres of gardens including a kitchen garden where the estate’s café sources fruit vegetables and herbs. “Our menu is produce-driven. It’s all about flavour and that’s what drives me. We can source a lovely bit of beef from a farm that’s two miles from my door, you are almost picking out your cow” Campbell says.“Right now we are waiting for the spring lamb. Just this morning, the gardeners have appeared with a crate full of leeks so that will be turned into soups, tarts, quiches and whatever . The milk and cream come in from farms just up the road. That’s what motivates us in the kitchen.”“We plan ahead and we are driven by what’s ready during a particular season. We are already in discussions about what produce to grow next year, we are always looking ahead. If we are hosting a wedding at Mount Stuart I encourage the bride and groom to come and visit the garden and talk about the produce that we can put on the plate.”We are now at the start of the season that Campbell most looks forward to as a chef: “The wild garlic has reared its head in the last fortnight, we’re not far from asparagus as well in Scotland. I’m one of the few chefs that is blessed with having a garden at their mercy and spring really drags you back into things after the winter.”The small independent food and drink businesses that have sprouted around the edges on Bute have provoked a subtle renaissance in Rothesay and across the island, while giving new energy to the existing businesses that have weathered the peaks and troughs of tourist trends and food fads.Macqueens of Rothesay opened as a butcher shop in , Burnside Dexters has the longest established herd of Dexter cattle in Scotland and Zaoni’s Café has been serving ice cream to visitors since .Adding to that, the Braw Liquor Club create locally sourced small batch cocktails, there’s cakes from Electric Bakery, Isle of Bute Gin is created with island botanicals, Spirit of Bute make whisky, local cheese is made with milk from Largievectrean Farm and Bute’s Fruits provide jams, chutneys and preserves. We are close to other west coast destinations that have boosted their food and drink credentials to match the impressive scenery – consider the proleration of seafood restaurants at Loch Fyne, the artisan producers of Arran and sustainable fish farmers of Gigha.Bute is not looking to compete for the summer scrum that descends on Skye or the convoy of motorhomes that arrive at Loch Lomond, but locals are ready to show a dferent side to the island. “I think the pandemic was an opportunity to come up with all these little ideas and make them happen” Campbell says. “I would encourage people to explore Bute, find the wee cafe and shops, take in the view at Ettrick Bay.”Cathleen echoes the sentiment, saying “everything we make on the island has a story behind it” adding that her own favourite spot on Bute is Scalpsie Beach, “you look out towards Arran and you get beautul views across to the mainland, you can do a loop out there and see a bit of the top to tail of Bute.\"There’s a signpost that I enjoy, it points in one direction to Rothesay and in the opposite direction to Rothesay. No matter what, you always know where you are going.”"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13622599.jpg?type=article-full","title":"travel-10-top-camping-destinations-scotland-suit","story":".

We did not expect the extremely positive and proactive response we received from the jobcentre. The team was very helpful,# said Jordan.The support Elite got from the jobcentre was invaluable in streamlining and accelerating its recruitment process which would take up to five weeks.#Now, the jobcentre advertises our vacancies via a sector-based work academy.#Candidates attend a two-week course at Weston College, Yeovil, to gain their Scaffolding Operative Training Scheme and Health  Safety Certications, as well as to prepare for an interview. Now when we interview candidates, they already have a scaffold labourer trainee card and the basic knowledge and understanding of the scaffolding industry.

As well as alleviating the burden of interviews that don’t progress into jobs, the savings in cost and time to get candidates suitably qualied are a bonus. It takes the pressure off our own resources and provides top quality candidates in the process.#‘Delighted’: Simon, Employer Adviser, Yeovil JobCentreOnce approached by Elite Scaffolding, also based in Yeovil, he set up a meeting with one of its office managers and worked out a bespoke recruitment package.As part of the programme, he contacted the local Weston College and together they “built” the course content.At the end of the two-week course, six candidates were offered a place on the apprenticeship scheme at a starting salary of £,.#Elite had exhausted all other channels to recruit and were delighted with the outcome#, he said.Moreover Elite referred other local employers to the jobcentre and Simon is running another sector-based work academy with a local roofing company.#The jobcentre has an incredible pool of talent.

Everything went through really quickly.#Continued the  year-old: “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel welcome and supported me. I spent six months on the placement and I got paid, too. It’s a proper job which was exactly what I needed. Day to day, I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since.“After six months, there was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD. Once I’d finished with the placement I got started on a qualication – CIPD level three in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year.

If the number of infections increases over the summer, this booster should help to reduce your risk of being admitted to hospital with Covid-.”The spring booster programme will begin in care homes from the start of April and will be carried out by community pharmacies.GPs will invite all their eligible patients who are aged over  for vaccination.They will also have the option to receive the booster at a participating community pharmacy or at a HSC Trust-led vaccination clinic.Health Trusts will also continue to run some vaccination centres as well as mobile clinics pop-up clinics.District nursing teams will continue to vaccinate the eligible housebound patients.Immunosuppressed iniduals are also eligible for the spring booster as long as there is at least three months since their previous dose.The Public Health Agency say Trust clinicians should write to advise their patients of this while GPs should provide a “safety net” service.Practices will be able to offer vaccination to any of their registered patients who meet the criteria of immunosuppressed at patient request of by practice identication.“COVID- has not gone away and we would urge those eligible to come forward for the spring booster when invited,” added Dr Johnston.Further infromation is available online at www.pha.site springbooster or by visit the NI Direct website.Most ReadTwo arrested and murder investigation launched after man’s death in NewtownabbeyWatch: Paul Gascoigne caught on camera tripping up child before Rangers challenge matchLucidTalk opinion poll: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont post as DUP lags behindLoyalist paramilitaries to target Irish government buildings as  weapons could be used in campaign against NI protocolBelfast restaurant issues ultimatum to culprit who covered worker’s car in ketchupTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Two arrested in Rathcoole following body discovery at Carrickfergus reservoir\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdc-b---bfa_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdc-b---bfa_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayWill Smith appears to hit Chris Rock on Oscars stage after gag about we JadaPlayWatch: Ken Branagh emotional over #very meaningful# Oscar win for BelfastLatest CoronavirusCo Antrim woman on nightmare of discovering seven-year-old daughter Emma had rare bone cancer‘My husband was killed by a disease he didn’t believe was real’ – former Strabane DJ Joe McCarron’s widow on his death from CovidReids Shoes of Sandy Row goes up for sale for £, to mark the end of an eraMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageViewpointOpinionParents need more information on jabLatestTitanic: One of history’s greatest scoops landed by Belfast Business in the Community Responsible Business Awards now open for Renewable energy chief says climate goals need radical actionPrince George and Princess Charlotte join service for great-grandfatherSSE increases earnings outlook after help from weather,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Pic: Jonathan McCambridge PA WireMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe results are in from our Spring  NI ‘Tracker’ poll, and we see that Sinn Fein are still comfortably in the lead as Northern Ireland’s largest party on a projected % vote share - up a % point from our Winter poll in January.Sinn Fein have now been the lead party in all polls for some time, and so they must be really hoping that they can achieve top spot in the May  election.The DUP are up two points in second place on %, and are seven points behind Sinn Fein.The other two unionist parties have dropped a bit, with the UUP on % - down a point since our January poll, and the TUV on % . Even so, this % score is still three times more than the TUV achieved in the last NI Assembly election in .So the trend is good for the DUP with perhaps some of their regular voters who moved to the TUV ing to the fold as the Assembly election approaches.However they still have a big gap to make upthey are to catch Sinn Fein, and there’s not much time left.The SDLP are at least consistent in the polls, coming in this time at % - no change from our Winter poll in January.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up  Read MoreLucidTalk opinion poll: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont post as DUP lags behindThe SDLP has been showing around the %-% vote-share mark for a long time, with no real up or down movement either way. Alliance are at %, up  points, perhaps benefiting from the UUP’s small drop.About this UUP drop, it’s noteworthy that Doug Beattie’s personal ‘leader rating’ in this poll was down  points from his January poll score, which is a hefty drop.Perhaps the Twitter posts controversy has been a factor here, and interestinglythis seems to have had more of a negative impact with female voters than males.Boris Johnson had the biggest increase in our ‘leader ratings’ - up  points from his January poll-score. This reflects the national UK-wide polls with the PM benefiting from a ‘Ukraine war bounce’. However, he still remains Northern Ireland’s lowest rated political leader at minus !Now the science of opinion polling applies to modelling and forecasting NI-wide public opinion, ie projecting vote-shares – that’s what polls do, and they usually do this pretty accurately.Read MoreSuzanne Breen:OpinionWith five weeks to go until Northern Ireland election, Sinn Fein remain in pole positionJon Tonge:OpinionAlliance on course to be third biggest party in the NI ExecutiveBut, of course, what people really want to knowis how all these vote-shares would translate into seats at the Assembly election.As the political commentators will tell you, vote-shares don’t always translate neatly into NI Assembly seats.Indeed, it’s perfectly possible for the TUV to get a %-% NI-Wide vote-share in this election, and for Jim Allister to still be the only TUV MLA – although, with that NI vote-share, they would have to be a bit unlucky for that to happen. It’s all down to where, and in what constituencies, the votes come from.So for our last pre-NI Assembly election pollwe will be running  separate NI constituency polls with the named candidates and parties for each constituency, presented to each poll respondent.Basically the poll-participants will be presented with actual ballot they will see in each of their respective constituencies on election day. Then, like we do with all our polls, we will combine all this data into NI-wide political-party vote-share projections.This approach brings in some of the reality of the election, as there’s always a brand and loyalty factor with some named candidates. We used this approach in our very last pre- UK general election poll, and we believe it was one of the factors that allowed us to forecast that election to within %.

Credit: NCA PARobin SchillerMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe -year jail term handed down to the Kinahan cartel’s “main man in the UK” marks a signicant victory in the fight against the international drugs gang.Thomas ‘Bomber’ Kavanaghoperated a lucrative network which saw more than €m worth of drugs hidden inside industrial machinery being smuggled into the UK in a single year.However, the high-ranking associate will be out of circulation until he is well into his s, when he is released on licence from the longest jail term he has received in a criminal career spanning over five decades.Born on September , , Kavanagh grew up in south central Dublin and was on the garda radar by the time he turned .In April  he picked up his first criminal conviction, and over the next  years was regularly in the dock for offences involving firearms, burglary, making threats to kill and assault.By the turn of the century, he was considered a serious player in organised crime and came into the sights of the recently formed Criminal Assets Bureau .The Bureau later secured an order for more than £, in unpaid taxes from the proceeds of his criminality.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up As a result of the increasing garda pressure, Kavanagh moved his family to the English Midlands in the early s, eventually settling in Tamworth, near Birmingham.He set up TK Motors in  which bought cars at auction before exporting them for profit to Ireland. Investigators believe he made “quite considerable” s from this enterprise which included trading cars across Europe and even in Dubai. However, they suspect he relied mainly on crime to fund his lestyle.While in the UK, gardaí suspect ‘Bomber’ was also linked to major drug shipments imported into Ireland through his contacts across continental Europe.By  his wealth was growing and that year he used fake documents to re-mortgage his £, home, a fraud for which he later received a fully suspended -month sentence. The house was lavishly refurbished, while a state-of-the-art security system, fortied gates, reinforced doors and bullet proof glass were also installed.His influence had also expanded across the Midlands and the National Crime Agencyassessed that his rise led to him becoming the Kinahans’ “figurehead” and “top man” in the UK. While his Europe-wide empire grew, garda intelligence in late  indicated that Kavanagh was rarely,ever, sighted in Ireland. That changed after February , , when his brother-in-law David Byrne was shot dead at the Regency Hotel in Drumcondra. Byrne was considered a close associate of the Kinahan gang in Dublin along with his older brother Liam. The murder would lead to a spate of gun murders, with  people killed in Ireland and Spain.He was a prominent mourner at the funeral  days later where he was joined by associates including feud killer Freddie Thompson and the Kinahan brothers Daniel and Christy Jnr. Also at the funeral service was an unknown middle-aged man, who garda inquiries would later determine was Declan Brady.Gardaí immediately began investigating the unassuming haulier who became known as ‘Mr Nobody’ and would turn out to be Kavanagh’s man in Ireland.The following January, Irish detectives raided a business in Dublin’s Greenogue industrial estate where they found ‘Mr Nobody’ along with two other men and an arsenal of high-powered weapons. More than €m worth of drugs were also seized in a later search.Financial documents led back to a logistics firm in the Midlands linked to Dublin brothers-in-law Gary Vickeryand Daniel Canning .As part of Operation Hornstay, a search at Dover Port in October  led to drugs worth €m hidden inside industrial machinery being seized, and the two men were arrested.Examinations of their devices showed they were receiving instructions from a man referred to as ‘The Gaffer’.Investigators also had to decipher the codewords used “Paper” was money, “Phones” were blocks of cocaine, “Sister’ was the machinery”, “Jelly” referred to Vickery while “Smiley” was Canning.In one email a week before the Dover bust ‘The Gaffer’ told his subordinates: “Ta put safe in sister and jelly b on in couple hours did not want to get him up tis morning from beauty sleep :”.The NCA established that this man was Thomas Kavanagh, who also used the alias Paul Christopher Harvey.The father of six was arrested at Birmingham airport on January , , while ing from a family holiday in Mexico.An encrypted BQ Aquaris device was found in his suitcase, indicating the cartel associate conducted business while on holiday.His luxury home was searched, and cash totalling £,, expensive watches, jewellery and luxury clothing seized. Weapons were also found, including knives, bats, and a pink stun gun disguised as a torch — for which he received a three-year jail term.More trouble was to come when he was charged along with Vickery and Canning in relation to the drugs importation conspiracy.The NCA suspects they imported €m worth of drugs into the UK between September  and October .​​​Judge Martyn Levett jailed him for  years at Ipswich Crown Court yesterday. Vickery and Canning were given prison terms of  and -and-a-half years respectively for their roles in the syndicate.All three will serve half of their sentences out on licence.After the hearing, NCA deputy director Matt Horne described Kavanagh as a “high-ranking member of the Kinahan cartel” and “their main man in the UK”.They will now go after The Gaffer’s assets, including his Tamworth home and any items bought with the proceeds of crime.Most ReadTwo arrested and murder investigation launched after man’s death in NewtownabbeyWatch: Paul Gascoigne caught on camera tripping up child before Rangers challenge matchLucidTalk opinion poll: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont post as DUP lags behindLoyalist paramilitaries to target Irish government buildings as  weapons could be used in campaign against NI protocolBelfast restaurant issues ultimatum to culprit who covered worker’s car in ketchupTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Two arrested in Rathcoole following body discovery at Carrickfergus reservoir\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdc-b---bfa_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdc-b---bfa_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayWill Smith appears to hit Chris Rock on Oscars stage after gag about we JadaPlayWatch: Ken Branagh emotional over #very meaningful# Oscar win for BelfastLatest Republic of IrelandHealth service under ‘huge pressure’ amid fresh surge in Covid casesPO Ferries refuses plea from Grant Shapps to reverse decision to sack workersFuneral held for Irish journalist killed in UkraineMalachi O#DohertyOpinionWhy the loyalist threat now has an agenda for its actionsRepublic of Ireland should maintain its military neutrality, say three quarters of Sinn Fein votersLatestTitanic: One of history’s greatest scoops landed by Belfast Business in the Community Responsible Business Awards now open for Westle announce fourth Belfast show due to ‘phenomenal demand’Steven Davis: No retirement plans for Northern Ireland captain as Rangers contract set to expireProtesters march in India’s capital on second day of nationwide strike,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Latvia stands for us. Estonia stands for us. Poland stands for us. France — Emanuel, I really believe that you will stand for us. Slovenia stands for us. Slovakia stands for us.“The Czech Republic stands for us. Romania knows what dignity is, so it will stand for us at the crucial moment. Bulgaria stands for us. Greece, I believe, stands with us.“Germany... A little later. Portugal — well, almost... Croatia stands for us. Sweden — yellow and blue should always stand together. Finland — I know you are with us. The Netherlands stands for the rational, so we’ll find common ground. Malta — I believe we will succeed. Denmark — I believe we will succeed. Luxembourg — we understand each other. Cyprus — I really believe you are with us.“Italy — thank you for your support! Spain — we’ll find common ground. Belgium — we will find arguments. Austria, together with Ukrainians, it is an opportunity for you. I’m sure of it. Ireland — well, almost.”The Ukrainian leader offered no further reasons for his comment.While fully backing the Ukrainian push for EU membership, Ireland has not abandoned its position of military neutrality in the face of the Russian assault.EU leaders have so far resisted the call to accelerate the accession of Ukraine to the bloc.Taoiseach Micheal Martin has since played down Zelensky’s comments, claiming the Ukrainian leader was talking in terms of the ‘European perspective’.Related topicsSinn FéinUkraineLucidTalk pollMore On Sinn Féin PremiumJust £k spent as multi-million pound Northern Ireland football stadiums scheme lies idle PremiumSam McBrideOpinionDUP gains ground, but overall support drops for ided unionismBelfast man in court accused of threat to kill MP John Finucane PremiumBill WhiteOpinionDUP running out of time to catch Sinn Fein but vote-shares don’t always translate to Assembly seatsBelfast City Council to host ‘Day of Reflection’ to acknowledge pain and hurt caused by the TroublesMost ReadTwo arrested and murder investigation launched after man’s death in NewtownabbeyWatch: Paul Gascoigne caught on camera tripping up child before Rangers challenge matchLucidTalk opinion poll: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont post as DUP lags behindLoyalist paramilitaries to target Irish government buildings as  weapons could be used in campaign against NI protocolBelfast restaurant issues ultimatum to culprit who covered worker’s car in ketchupTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Two arrested in Rathcoole following body discovery at Carrickfergus reservoir\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdc-b---bfa_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdc-b---bfa_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayWill Smith appears to hit Chris Rock on Oscars stage after gag about we JadaPlayWatch: Ken Branagh emotional over #very meaningful# Oscar win for BelfastLatest Republic of IrelandHealth service under ‘huge pressure’ amid fresh surge in Covid casesPO Ferries refuses plea from Grant Shapps to reverse decision to sack workersFuneral held for Irish journalist killed in UkraineMalachi O#DohertyOpinionWhy the loyalist threat now has an agenda for its actionsSecond PO ferry detained after safety inspection, coastguard agency saysLatestTitanic: One of history’s greatest scoops landed by Belfast Business in the Community Responsible Business Awards now open for Gold DofE award holder tells memorial service of impact of Philip’s ‘vision’Renewable energy chief says climate goals need radical actionPrince George and Princess Charlotte join service for great-grandfather,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Annalena Baerbock, German foreign minister, and Robert Habeck, federal minister for economic affairs and climate protection By Frank Jordans, APMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe world needs to take “radical action” to sht away from fossil fuels and ensure global warming does not pass dangerous thresholds, the head of the International Renewable Energy Agencyhas said.The agency’s -page report concluded that investments of . trillion dollarsin renewable energy are needed globally each year until  to reduce emissions and meet the goals of the Paris climate accord.Currently, those emissions are going up, not down.Francesco La Camera, the director-general of Irena, told an energy conference in Berlin: “The energy transition is far from being on track and anything short of radical action in the coming years will diminish, even eliminate chances to meet our climate goals.”Countries agreed seven years ago in Paris to limit global warming to C– and ideally no more than .C– to avoid potentially catastrophic consequences for the entire planet.A recent report by a UN science  found that with temperatures already more than .C above the pre-industrial average, billions of people around the world are vulnerable to impacts from climate change.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news aec .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_bc-f-c-ef-ee_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph

requiredSign Up Mr La Camera told the Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue that “not only the .C, the C goal is really in dangerwe don’t act and don’t make a dramatic change in the way we produce and consume energy”.Abu Dhabi-based Irena suggested that investments of  billion dollarsshould be erted away from the fossil fuel sector annually to avoid creating wells, pipelines and power plants that cannot be used any more.This was echoed by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who called for an end to private sector financing for coal power, which surged to record highs last year.“Lenders need to recognise that coal and fossil fuels are futile investments that will lead to billions of dollars in stranded assets,” he said.With some countries ramping up domestic fossil fuel production amid energy price hikes and fears of supply shortages because of Russia’s war in Ukraine, Mr Guterres urged governments not to delay the sht away from fossil fuels.“The current crisis shows that we must accelerate, not slow, the renewable energy transition,” he said.“This is the only true path to energy security.”Most ReadTwo arrested and murder investigation launched after man’s death in

The Ballynahinch scheme represents excellent value for money and should have been prioritised during the past two years.Mr Hazzard said more than poundbn of capital resources has been spent by the roads minister and her department during the letime of the current Assembly.ldquoIt is hugely disappointing that a small, yet strategically important scheme, such as the Ballynahinch bypass has been left on the shelf. In light of the economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would have been a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of the local community, said the MP.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWe can only hope now that when the Executive is restored after Mayrsquos election, that the local community can have a minister in place who recognises the value of the Ballynahinch bypass and finally begins construction.Mr Casement said the bypass could help kick-start the economic regeneration of the town and provide the wider South Down tourism economy with a signicant boost. He said it was vital a start date for construction work is confirmed as soon as possible.A key member of Ballynahinchrsquos Regeneration Committee for many years alongside the late Vincent Fullam, Mr Casement has never given up the battle to secure a bypass, which was first mooted in the late s.ldquoThe bypass is included in a list of strategic projects and is effectively ready to proceed. There should be no more delays. The scheme should have been delivered years ago, he declared.ldquoWhile the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, there are many other benefits, including reduced town centre pollution.Mr Casement added: ldquoThe new road scheme will also dissuade drivers from using built-up housing areas and rural roads as unofficial bypasses and, most importantly, help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre. We need to see work starting on the scheme now.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said it was committed to delivering the bypass as part of a plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation, while addressing regional imbalance.He said that ldquofar from being left on the shelf, the scheme was being actively progressed much further by Ms Mallon than any other minister, with development work now substantively complete and statutory approvals finalised in July last year.ldquoThe next stage would involve commencing the procurement of a contractor but progression to procurement and construction is dependent upon the level of funding made available to the Department in future budgets, he explained.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos bid for the - budget included funds to deliver this scheme, however, the absence of an Executive means there is no agreed budget which means that delivery timescales remain uncertain.The spokesman added: ldquoThis is a priority for our Minister who remains frustrated that once again the absence of an Executive is negatively affecting both the people of Northern Ireland and our infrastructure..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Carryduff landowner helps the environment with trees  ","story":"CARRYDUFF landowner Rosanna Ballentine and her son Iain have received  trees to plant on their farm to help them enhance bioersity and create a habitat for wildle.The trees have been supplied from a partnership between Trees on the Land ndash a charity and not-for-profit project from the Green Economy Foundation ndash and SuperValu and Centra, part of the Musgrave Group.The project is part of a sustainability initiative from the retail brands which recently announced they will plant , trees across Northern Ireland over ten years.Mrs Ballentine welcomed the initiative and the assistance of SuperValu and Centra staff, along with central colleagues from Musgrave NI, who pulled on their wellies and visited the farm to help plant a mix of hawthorn, oak, birch, rowan and hazel trees.She said: ldquoWe are planting a new native hedgerow and a line of trees along the edge of an existing woodland to ide it from an adjoining agricultural grassland.

crowned Bobby Dalzell Cup champions after defeating local rivals Ardglass in the deciding penalty shoot-out at Meadowvale last Thursday.A goal on the stroke of half-time from Ardglass midfielder Stephen Deegan was cancelled out on  minutes by the close range effort of Celtic striker Jordan McCoubrey.The teams refused to be split in extra-time and following the shoot-out mdash which went well into the sudden death stages mdash Blaine Connolly converted the all-important spot kick to gt his Hoopsrsquo side the victory.A large crowd turned out in Drumaness for the St Patrickrsquos Day showpiece between the current first and second-placed sides in the Newcastle Leaguersquos Premier Division.Adding to the pressure of the occasion was the alternating weather conditions, with the teams contesting the final in periods of sunshine as well as wind and rain.Nevertheless, Celtic kicked off the affair with the blustery conditions heavily in favour of their opponents.It didnrsquot take long for the tone of the match to be set as Ardglass defender Caolain OrsquoShea launched a very physical tackle on Hoops striker Jay Gibney.Ardglass enjoyed early momentum with experienced defender Neil Teggart seeing his wind-assisted free kick from his own half trouble Celtic custodian Nathan Curran less than ten minutes in.Celtic remained calm and soon strung their passes together through clever one touch football with eventual man of the match winner Conor Doherty in the thick of these sequences.However, Ardglass remained a threat and came close when Teggart clipped a cross into the danger area, although striker Michael Magee glanced his header wide.Stand-in Celtic captain Shaun Megahey attempted to play a through ball to team-mate Gibney, but on this occasion the Ardglass defence timed the offside trap perfectly.Celtic did come close when Barry Treacyrsquos corner kick was fumbled by Ardglass lsquokeeper, Mark Armstrong, although Hoops defender Paul Brady couldnrsquot dispatch the ball quickly enough before the danger was cleared.OrsquoShea continued his earlier eagerness and picked up a yellow card for a mistimed tackle before his team-mate, Magee, was unfairly clattered at the other end of the pitch, although Teggartrsquos effort flew past the wrong side of the post.Teggart continued to be a problem from set pieces as his free-kick delivery whisked past the head of striker Magee and out of bounds.Moments later, Mageersquos misfortune continued when he was shown a yellow card for expressing his disagreement with referee, Barry Mullan.After initially allowing the match to flow freely, referee Mullan clamped down on his decisions with less than ten minutes to the end of the opening half.Celtic defender Gary Carberry was the latest to enter the book for a late challenge on Ardglass marksman Magee.Despite this hiccup, Celticrsquos Carberry kept himself in contention for the man of the match accolade after he proved pivotal in stopping potential goalscoring chances from the Ardglass opposition on numerous occasions.As the half-time whistle approached, Celtic arms were raised as they appealed for the red card to be shown to Ardglassrsquos OrsquoShea, who may have considered himself lucky to escape an early bath after he was second to the ball.Ardglass launched another attack and it looked asMagee would have a free route to goal. However, Celtic veteran Brady recovered valiantly to prove he still has plenty of miles left in his tank.With the last attack of the half, Ardglass were awarded a corner and they took full advantage of their opportunity. Midfielder, Stephen Deegan, climbed high above the rest to head his effort beyond the outstretched hand of Celtic lsquokeeper Curran to open the scoring.As the second half kicked off it was evident that both sides would refrain from going for broke. A lot of the following ten minutes contained attacks, although both sides lacked a killer instinct and the match was heavily contested in the middle of the pitch.This is where Conor Doherty earned his post-match award for his performance, as he often won the midfield battle.Goal-scorer Deegan picked up a yellow as the weather took yet another turn for the worse.Celtic joint-managers Jason Galbraith and Matthew McKenna made the first of their substitutions as the clock struck the hour mark with Sean McMahon entering the fray in place of Conaill Kerr.Ardglass opted to put  men behind the ball in order to frustrate the opposition and waited patiently for their opportunity to counter-attack.Ardglass made changes of their own in the form of Jordan Finnegan before Celtic made a second substitute with the talented Sean Ferris making his way onto the pitch.Ferris made an immediate impact, adding another string to Celticrsquos bow by spreading inviting passes into his forward line.With just  minutes left of the , these Celtic substitutions came to fruition after the ball found its way to McMahon, who lofted an inviting ball into the Ardglass box which was steered home by the boot of striker McCoubrey.Celtic continued to mix things up as Corey McCartan made his way onto the pitch and gave a good account of himself with his tireless work rate.Despite this period of succession for the Hoops, the remaining minutes of the  played out finely balanced.Ardglass never let their headsand should be commended for their effort as they cancelled out any further attack whilst continuously seeking the crucial next goal.As tempers flared, the final whistle sounded and both teams prepared for extra-time.The highlights of the first half of extra-time came in the form of Celticrsquos Treacy picking up a yellow card before team-mate Ferris crashed his left-footed effort off the crossbar.During the next interval, both of Ardglassrsquo Magee and Celticrsquos Ferris threatened but they couldnrsquot do enough to get the ball over the line and it would be penalties that would decide the final outcome.Amongst the numerous penalties which took place, both Celtic and Ardglass players were ordered to retake their spot kicks.Firstly, Celtic striker McCoubrey saw his effort denied by Armstrong before referee Mullan blew his whistle after adjudging the Ardglass custodian to be off his line as the penalty was taken.McCoubrey fired in the retake and it wouldnrsquot be long before Ardglass substitute Finnegan would go through a similar course of events after he missed his initial penalty but converted at the second time of asking.Eventually, as the penalties progressed well into sudden death, Celticrsquos Blaine Connolly remained calm and converted the deciding spot kick to send the Hoopsrsquo support into delirium as his side were crowned champions.Following the conclusion, man of the match Conor Doherty gave his thoughts on his sidersquos victory.ldquoI thought we were the better team in the first half but then they snuck a goal before half-time, he said.ldquoBut, even with the wind we started to press on, it was a long  minutes.ldquoIt was a hard hitting game but Irsquom just glad we got on the winning side of it.He added: ldquoAll the penalties were top class, it was a really good shootout.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey , B Connolly, P Brady, G Carberry, C

There are always more jobs to be carried out on the collection.However, using the images effectively, and in the way the Hudson and Newman families, and indeed all other donors, wished, requires wide knowledge of all the collections by experienced and qualied professional staff working with them on a daily basis.The photographic archive is recognised as one of the most important in Ireland and contains a wide range of images, including daguerrotypes, glass negative plates, lantern slides, black and white and colour film, transparencies as well as digital images.Understanding of all the processes involved in their making is essential to how they are cared for and used.Lesley Simpson is secretary of the Friends of Down County Museum and former Keeper of Collections at the museum..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Success at Downpatrick  ","story":"PRIOR to Sundayrsquos Randox Ulster National Handicap Chase meeting at Downpatrick Racecourse, manager Richard Lyttle stated that he was looking forward to welcoming racegoers back to the track for the first time in three years.They certainly turned up with car parks filled to capacity, packed enclosures and long tailbacks on the Ballydugan Road prior to the first race.The Randox Ulster National has been the local tracks major race of the year now for many years and the maximum  runners faced the starter for the three mile four furlong race that sees prize money paid right down to the first six past the post.A bit like the big Aintree race, there was plenty of fallers with two coming down at the very first fence and Envoi Pierji then unseating Donegal jockey Conor Orr, who had ridden Screaming Colours to success for Bill Durkan in the Midlands National at Uttoxeter the previous day.Later in the race there was more fallers at the regulation fence.With two fences to be taken the race involved four runners with the  winner Amaulino travelling like the winner under David McGrath.But this combination then faded, eventually finishing fourth for Co Armagh trainer Keith Watson.The eventual winner in the famous J P McManus Silks proved to be Spades Are Trumps, ridden by Cheltenham winning jockey Mark McDonagh, a lb claimer.Finishing second was Agent Born, ridden by Darragh OrsquoKeefe with Peaches and Cream third.Co Meath trainer Gavin Cromwell, who also had success at Cheltenham, saddled the winner and also the third past the post.

They were used as a commercial rabbit warren when John De Courcy arrived and built Dundrum Castle in .The lucrative trade in rabbit pelts continued for centuries afterwards. Rabbits are still common today, although the population was decimated by the myxomatosis disease in the s.The s was also when the National Trust began managing the habitat on behalf of its owners, the Hill family mdash commonly known as the Marquises of Downshire.The Hill family came to the area in the late th century but had lived in Ireland since the late s, when a young army officer named Moyses Hill, originally from Devon, was posted to Carrickfergus garrison in  to command forces sent by Elizabeth I to subdue the rebellious OrsquoNeill clan and colonise Ireland.Moyses ended up staying in Ireland and marrying the sister of a local clan chief. In , he was granted land at Cromlyn, an area which later took his surname and became known as Hillsborough. His descendants then acquired Murlough in  and began using Murlough Farm as their summer residence.They built Murlough House in , which still stands today at the end of Keel Point mdash at the northern end of the beach. While built to have a spectacular sea view, stormy weather kept breaking the windows, so trees were planted around the house in , and the woodland remains to this day.In , the th Marquis of Downshire, Arthur Hill, sold the surrounding land to the National Trust and then sold the house in . The area became Irelandrsquos first nature reserve in  and remains the most extensive dune heath in Ireland .But prior to being sold to the National Trust, Murlough House and the dunes were a hotbed of military activity ndash particularly during WWII. The house was a base for the US Armyrsquos st Armoured Division and the th Tank Destroyer Battalion.They built several firing ranges in the dunes, including, allegedly, a mortar range. Spare bombers and fighters were also hidden there as Murlough Farm had its own landing strip, called lsquo Satellite Landing Groundrsquo .Murlough beach itself was dotted with anti-aircraft and anti-invasion posts mdash whose rotting remnants are still visible today. They were dug-in when a full-scale German invasion was a threat in the early s.They were part of a counter-invasion strategy that centred on slowing or stopping the enemy at certain locations until other forces could be mustered and deployed. This involved constructing a so-called lsquocoastal crustrsquo along beaches and inland lsquostop-linesrsquo along rivers, canals and high ground.With Northern Ireland being prime invasion territory, a coastal crust was set up from Magilligan in the north-west to Newcastle in the south-east, alongside an inland stop-line along the route of the River Bann. Anti-aircraft landing posts, like those at Murlough, were important in preventing aircraft or boats from landing, but another type of defence was the centrepiece of this strategy: pillboxes.When events at Dunkirk in  sparked invasion panic, the Directorate of Fortications and Works at the War Office was created to construct defensive systems around the UKrsquos beaches. The Royal Engineers and civilian contractors erected over , pillboxes by in a matter of days ndash including on eight of Northern Irelandrsquos beaches.Such structures can still be seen at Magilligan, Portrush and Portstewart. County Down also has intact examples in Bangor, Donaghadee and on the Strangford shore between Comber and Newtownards. Beaches at Minerstown and Tyrella also had multiple pillboxes, as did Murlough. They were spaced to have interlocking arcs of fire, so invaders had little unchallenged space in which to land.One of these pillboxes is still visible in Newcastle, on the beach just below the outdoor swimming pool. The remnants of the other are still visible at the northern end of Murlough, next to the inlet that feeds Dundrum Bay. Yet all that is left are large slabs of reinforced concrete as this pillbox was supposedly destroyed in the early days of the Troubles to prevent it being used to attack the nearby Ballykinlar Army Camp.But these remains are now also under attack from erosion. They are gradually being absorbed by the sea. With this stretch of coastline losing five to ten metres of coastline a year, the remnants of the pillbox, originally built at an elevated height in the dunes, is even starting to be submerged at high tide.What was once a reflection of an indominable spirit is now an unassuming pile of rubble used only as a seat for resting walkers ndash most of whom are unaware of its history. Soon, it will be completely forgotten and the only reminder of this stretch of coastlinersquos rich military history will be the occasional washed-up ordnance.Ben Acheson spent seven years deployed to Afghanistan, including stints as Director of NATOrsquos political team and as Political Adviser to the EU Special Representative.

Now he has picked up a statuette for a film that is simply called ‘Belfast’.The production has had a warm reception in Europe and north America and received multiple nominations in the major film ceremonies, now including the Academy Awards.It has been popular at home too, albeit not to everyone’s tastes — with the plotline perhaps at times being simplied and sentimentalised for international audiences.But Sir Kenneth more than deserves his recognition.His career has been a glittering one, yet he has never become an arrogant figure. On the contrary, he is humble and been loyal to the city in which he was born, even in the heady years when he was rising towards Hollywood stardom.His film ‘Belfast,’ with its first rank local cast and a homegrown soundtrack too , is a tribute to Northern Ireland and its capital city and the resilience of the people who live here.We know what a wonderful place this is, despite the trauma from the former troubled years.

Announcing the bounce back support scheme, Mr Poots said: “Many businesses and sectors were adversely affected by the Covid- pandemic, and our agricultural shows were not immune to these effects, with all shows cancelled in  and only a few being able to take place in . This resulted in shows losing the opportunity to raise vital funds that would help prepare for the  season. “Shows play a vital role in showcasing our excellent agri-food produce and supporting our rural communities, as well as boosting our economy and the additional tourism opportunities. These shows are predominately run by many volunteers who give of their free time and I would like to extend my thanks to them for all of their hard work. “Pre-pandemic agricultural shows attracted more than , visitors. It is essential therefore that NI shows have the opportunity to run a full schedule this year to promote and facilitate future economic growth for agri-food businesses and I am pleased that I can support their efforts through the provision of the pound, bounce back support scheme I’ve announced today, which will allow each show to claim up to a maximum of poundk for new or increased costs. “Departmental officials will contact shows directly in the next few weeks to assist them in availing of my support scheme.” Looking to the future, Mr Poots has announced plans for an independent review of local agricultural shows, which will explore the potential for longer term support options and help shows remain sustainable in the years ahead. He added: “Although I am providing support to our local shows this year, I am of the view that Government departments and local councils should consider options for longer term support. “I am therefore announcing plans for an independent review to commence in the next month or two which will aim to explore future support options and guide future policy, in addition to identying new and innovative methods which would be utilised by local shows to help safeguard their future.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_abcdecfefbedfa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bbdbbbadaaac   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1635169051553.jpg--hargey_tackles_digital_exclusion_through_provision_of_free_broadband.jpg?163516905100","title":"hargey tackles digital exclusion through provision of free broadband ","story":"Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey has announced the provision of free broadband for those facing digital exclusion as a barrier to work. The broadband support package will be available to eligible jobseekers through the Department for Communities’ Adviser Discretion Fund, a grant fund available to help remove barriers to employment that prevent people moving towards and into employment Minister Hargey said: “Digital exclusion has been one of the inequalities thrown into sharper focus by the Covid- pandemic. “More than ever, employers are posting vacancies online, with many having moved to online interviewing and more positions requiring people to work from home. “Therefore, not having access to broadband can be a signicant barrier to searching for, or moving into, employment. “I am tackling this by providing free broadband support which will provide broadband for eligible jobseekers who do not currently have the service.” Support for broadband through the Adviser Discretion Fund is available for a period of six months. The Fund can provide a non-repayable grant of up to pound,, in a  month period, to remove barriers to employment. The Minister continued: “The success of the Adviser Discretion Fund in helping remove barriers to employment has already been seen throughout the year, particularly in the uptake of upfront childcare costs, which I made available last October. “I am delighted that we have already helped around  parents with average upfront childcare costs of approximately pound. “This additional scheme will help remove similar barriers to employment for those facing digital exclusion due to a lack of broadband service.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aeafbcdabec   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bdedcaadd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1613125631842.jpg--booster_third_dose_milestone_welcomed.jpg?161312563100","title":"booster third dose milestone welcomed ","story":"The number of COVID- vaccine boosters and third doses administered in Northern Ireland has passed the one million mark. The milestone has been welcomed by Patricia Donnelly, head of Northern Ireland’s vaccination programme. She said: “GPs, community pharmacists and Trusts have all worked extremely hard to roll out the booster campaign, with the period in the run up to Christmas particularly busy. “They all deserve our heartfelt thanks. Because of the vaccines, we now have much greater protection against the virus. “All those involved in the vaccination programme are genuine history makers.” Booster doses have been provided from the latter stages of last year, supplementing the two primary doses already received. At the same time, a third primary dose was offered to people with a severely weakened immune system, which was then followed by a booster three months after their third primary dose. The latest tallies on Northern Ireland’s vaccination dashboard include , boosters and , third doses. Patriciacontinued: “While demand for vaccines is no longer at levels from the peak of the campaign, people are still coming forward on a daily basis for boosters and first and second doses. “It’s still not too late to get these jabs. Please do so - and benefit from the really important protection they bring.” The one million landmark has been reached with the Spring booster campaign imminent. In line with UK-wide guidance set by the JCVI, the Spring campaign will offer an additional booster dose to: anyone who is aged  or over care home residents and anyone aged  and over who has a severely weakened immune system.
