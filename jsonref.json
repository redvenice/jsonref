In a 2014 memoir, bouncer Sven Marquart explained that his job was all about fostering the “right mix”.“I don’t mind letting in the odd lawyer in a double-breasted suit with his Gucci-Prada wife. If they make a good impression, let them in,” he wrote. “We also take guys in masks and kilts, or Pamela Anderson blondes in run-of-the-mill high-street outfits who tag along with bearded blokes, licking the sweat off each others’ armpits. That, for me, is Berghain.”Curators said the exhibition would focus on “the studio as a space for contemplation and production”. While Berlin claims to be home to the highest density of studios and artists’ workshops in Europe, many artists have struggled to find outlets for their work as exhibitions and art fairs have been cancelled or postponed.The collaboration between the nightclub and the art world is the latest creative attempt to preserve the infrastructure of Berlin’s nightlife during the pandemic. Some Berlin night-time venues with outdoor spaces, such as Klunkerkranich in Neukölln and :about blank in Friedrichshain, have temporarily converted into beer gardens selling drinks and pizzas. Other clubs have held quiz nights or flea markets.But while Berlin’s senate has paid out emergency funds of around €81,000 to a number of venues, organisers say they will struggle to keep paying their employees via the government’s part-time furlough scheme for much longer.Berghain, once dubbed the “Berlin Philharmonic of electronic music”, shut its doors to protect visitors from the virus on 11 March, before authorities began enforcing closures by law.

It had led to the loss of £300m in US sales, with some firms pulling out of the US entirely, adding to the sales crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Truss’s visit to the US last week to lobby Robert Lighthizer, the US trade representative leading his government’s trade deal talks, “was clearly too little, too late”, Betts said.“The UK government must accelerate negotiations to bring an end to tariffs between the UK and US before preparations for November’s presidential election bring talks to a halt,” she added. “It has taken the UK government a full six months after the UK left the EU to start to tackle tariffs directly with the US government, which seems to us inexplicably slow.“The UK government must now focus its energy on developing a clear strategy for settling the UK share of the Airbus-Boeing and steel and aluminium disputes with the US, rather than looking to the EU to do this for us.”Airbus said last month it would end a system of financial support from France and Spain that the World Trade Organization had deemed illegal and unfair to Boeing, Airbus’s arch rival. However, Lighthizer said on Wednesday the EU and member states had “not taken the actions necessary to come into compliance with WTO decisions”.Truss confirmed on Twitter on Thursday morning she was still pressing for the continuing tariffs on malt whisky to be lifted. “I welcome the US decision not to impose tariffs on gin and blended whisky, and to remove tariffs on shortbread,” she said.SWA officials believe the US is keeping the malt whisky, as well as other high-value goods such as cashmere woollens, as a bargaining chip in its battle with the EU and UK in the Airbus-Boeing dispute, after the WTO upheld US complaints that the EU unfairly subsidises Airbus.The SWA believes UK ministers were relying too heavily on the EU to negotiate a deal in that dispute, and only began focusing on the damage to UK exports after it began intensively lobbying ministers, including Boris Johnson, during the prime minister’s trip to Scotland last month.The controversy also plays heavily into domestic politics, fuelling attacks in Scotland on the UK government’s eagerness to strike deals with Donald Trump while failing to protect such a valuable and emblematic product, nine months before next May’s Scottish parliamentary election.Ivan McKee, the Scottish government’s trade minister, said this crisis was a significant test of Johnson’s post-Brexit trade policy.“For too long, the UK government waited for the EU to fix this issue for them rather than getting on and fixing it themselves. That prevarication cost months of sales for key Scottish exporters – including our shortbread firms,” he said. “Having left the EU, the UK government has the trade powers it wanted. Now it must use them. This is a first real test of the independent trade policy it wanted so badly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9d5f474b51da9aff7e95b45cf6fe0b7860c1da6/0_172_5904_3544/master/5904.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a0cdf6fc9c2657e4671a237870b9d39","title":"tui records 1bn loss amid covid 19 travel shutdown","story":"Tui, Europe’s biggest holiday company, has warned that business is unlikely to return to normal until 2022 as it revealed losses so far this year have totalled €2bn (£1.8bn).Over the first nine months the company’s financial year it has posted a loss of €2bn, with €1.1bn of that coming over the past three months.The firm’s chief executive, Fritz Joussen, said Tui was the first travel company to fly passengers on holiday following the lifting of restrictions and stressed that “summer holidays are conducted responsibly and with the highest standards of hygiene in all markets”.“We acted very quickly at the beginning of the crisis in March and we responsibly mastered the new start in the summer – together with governments and partners. We will now sustainably reduce our costs and thereby strengthen our position in the market,” Joussen said.Tui has secured an extra €1.2bn from the German government, to get it through the quiet winter season. This is on top of a €1.8bn loan commitment it received from German state lender KfW in March as travel ground to a halt across Europe, taking its total government support to €3bn.Despite government help, the company and the wider travel sector will remain under pressure in the coming months, according to Julie Palmer, a partner at insolvency firm Begbies Traynor.“Costs reductions must be a focus for the board over the next few months if the business is to have any chance of survival, which will likely add to the growing number of redundancies being made by UK firms,” Palmer said.Tui, which is also the UK’s biggest holiday operator, announced in July it would shut 166 high street travel stores across the UK and Ireland, and ask affected staff to work from home, as the coronavirus pandemic has hastened the shift to booking holidays online rather than on the high street.In addition, the travel operator said that customers are booking their trips at shorter notice ahead of their departure.Travel consultant Toby Nicol said he expected that trend will remain, as long as spikes in Covid-19 cases around the world lead to the introduction of new travel restrictions, and quarantine measures.Nicol added this will give travel companies less oversight of customer demand, and will also force them to offer competitive prices.“If you’re a family, you’re not going booking for next summer now or in January, you’ll be saying let’s leave it and see. People will go where the deal is, it could be France, Spain, or Portugal, people are highly promiscuous when it comes to deciding where to go and who’s got the best deal.”The winding down of the furlough scheme and economic downturn are also expected to cause problems for travel companies, as consumers watch their outgoings and discretionary spending more closely."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81dbdce36d2d32a3742d2871440dfcc40e6d1fc5/0_718_5000_2999/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b47ba7a78704b46de9eb67660fe74190","title":"office future britain commuter towns home working","story":"The rise in home working has thrown city centres into crisis. If I were in the property game, I’d buy anywhere with a cathedralIs the office dead? Not an office, which everyone needs, but “the office”, the institution, the corporate HQ, the great overhead in the sky. Just as once the farm gave way to the factory and the factory to the desk, so technology transforms the nature of work. At the turn of the 21st century the digital revolution shrank offices to tiny screens. From then on offices have lived on borrowed time. Coronavirus has called their bluff. But has bluff also been called on the office’s sovereign domain, the city centre?Two weeks ago Johnson abruptly changed his mind and told office workers to report for duty. Few have obeyed. Walk through London’s Canary Wharf, Manchester’s Deansgate or Birmingham’s Colmore Row, and you see ghost cities. Offices stand vacant, shops, pubs and cafes closed and even boarded up. Come September, some workers will return, but I can find no expert who expects them in anything like their previous numbers.In his classic biography of the Cambridgeshire village of Foxton, The Common Stream, Rowland Parker described its many traumas. They included invading Saxons, the Black Death and, most recently, the arrival of combine harvesters in the 1920s. The machines slashed the need for farm labour. The village emptied. Rural vitality was devastated.The media is awash in studies declaring that offices are good for us after all. They promote social ersity and informal contacts, offering relief from relationship claustrophobia in “getting out of the house”. Management ideology has long identified “the company” with its headquarters, its physical presence and hierarchy. The New Scientist reports the boss of Microsoft worrying that unmonitored home working will eat into the “social capital” built up in an office environment. Zoom cannot replace the gossip of “those two minutes before and after” a meeting. We know that from TV’s The Office.None the less, office workers seem certain to vote with their feet. As a Birmingham lawyer told the , “There is absolutely no reason for us to be in this office every day – I can do my job perfectly well from anywhere.” He spoke for millions. Hence the three-quarters of American CFOs now accepting that they must introduce remote working.Emptying city centres of a quarter of their office workers would be commercially devastating. It would wipe out the profit margins of the shops, cafes and pubs that depend on them. Rents would plummet on newly emergent office blocks, lacking as they do the adaptability of the old Victorian streets they replace. Towers will blight townscapes as corporate dinosaurs.Commuting has come to be seen as an unnecessary health hazard. A worker visiting his or her office will be like going shopping, an occasional discretionary activity. Yes, we will value the human contact with workplace friends, clients and associates, but not 9-to-5, five days a week. This treadmill was the ethos of Dickens’ factory work carried into the office. It is out of date.This need not be bad news for cities. The decline in offices will leave more space for housing. Cultural and leisure activities will recover. Historic quarters – if conserved – will attract the creative industries that are seen as holding the key to modern city economies, industries that thrive on urban concentration. I was intrigued by Angus Thirlwell of the Hotel Chocolat chain bewailing to the BBC the fate of his big city outlets, while lauding his successes in Cheltenham, St Albans, Stamford and Harrogate. These are the new work hubs. If I was in the property game, I would buy anywhere with a cathedral."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bff1bbef7f83ca5cb98416dfba6edf5ca0b0e1e/36_47_2924_1754/master/2924.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34a3fc9fe5a1c59f270cf06195c0ff0c","title":"why does no 10 want to devolve local councils just as they are needed most","story":"The government’s extraordinary proposal to sweep away district councils is unlikely to go unchallengedToday it’s A-level maladministration, but every day some new failure shames this government beset with epochal crises. Abysmal handling of Covid-19 casts England as having the highest excess deaths in Europe, and the UK as suffering the deepest recession in the G7, while Brexit still looms.That’s enough to busy this cabinet of incompetents. Yet the great disrupters digging No 10 into ever deeper holes are still at it with pickaxe and shovel. What a time to launch a colossal centralising reorganisation of local government, but that’s what next month’s white paper will do, under the misleading rubric of “devolution”. The intent is to force unitary councils everywhere, sweeping away the district councils beneath them: it looks neat – but it’s devoid of evidence that another great upheaval does anything but disrupt, cost money and distract council officials who are already overstretched coping with Covid rather better than Whitehall is.District councils of all hues are putting up a fight. Why No 10 would choose this moment to rile battalions of Tory councillors, backed by their Tory MPs, is a mystery to observers. As the London School of Economics’ Prof Tony Travers reminds me, all local government reorganisations favour the party in power. This one sweeps away irritating Labour and Liberal Democrat urban district blobs holding their forts against a sea of blue county councils. Norwich, Leicester, Oxford and scores more towns and cities will put up a fight not to be swallowed into Torydom. Green- and Lib-Dem-controlled Lewes will never go quietly into the great East Sussex blue. The government is starting with North Yorkshire – but don’t expect yellow York or red Scarborough to kowtow. Nor will many Tory districts agree to be swallowed into the whales of their bigger counties.Large sums are being squandered by districts and county councils hiring expensive consultancies to write opposing reports proving which is most efficient. Some districts’ plans bid to ide counties into fewer larger districts, though this may also gerrymander red to blue. England, says Travers, suffers “an endless churn” of reorganisations.A prime motor for all this is No 10’s contempt for local government. Odd timing, now Whitehall is forced into a belated climb-down over test and trace, finally admitting only local council public health expertise can do it. Look how, when push comes to shove, Whitehall summons top-quality local government chief executives to run their programmes: first Leeds’ chief executive, now Oldham’s excellent leaders are recruited to repair Whitehall’s failed test and trace. Every observer notes how the calibre of local government leaders and chief executives has soared in recent years, unlike this decadent cabinet.Whitehall departments and their ministers are the ones that should be threatened with special measures, whether it’s the Home Office over Windrush, the Department of Education over abysmal lockdown failures and now A-levels, or the Department for Work and Pensions over universal-credit fiascos. Traducing local government is just a distracting blame-shift.The lesson is not learned: local government will be plunged into turmoil, every officer reapplying for their job under new brass plates on No 10’s whim. Subtly done, the white paper will force councils themselves to come up with their own plans to turn unitary, or receive no growth funds.There is no optimum size, but the ministry has proclaimed a random 300-400,000 population minimum (with optional decorations of tiny parish councils with no power or money). Since the abolition of the Audit Commission, there’s no evidence on efficacy.The more local, the more trusted the politician. Satisfaction with councillors improves with their nearness: distant county councillors elected by 9,000 voters are less trusted than nearby districts, with councillors elected by 2,000.This is all a deliberate distraction from the one great problem: councils are crippled by cuts and an inability to raise finance, rendering them powerless. But expect no plan for financial renewal – no local sales or income tax, no Amazon tax on deliveries, no hotel and tourism tax nor any reform of council tax and business rates.The social care crisis may summon more cash, but don’t expect that to fall to councils’ control. The “devolution” white paper will not devolve things that matter most, as Whitehall departments’ plans ignore the shape of localities: the new NHS integrated care systems don’t match existing councils, let alone planned new ones. Nor do local enterprise partnerships, local enterprise boards, nor transport authorities, nor Homes England’s social housing plans. None of the necessary push for retraining, upskilling and a “kickstart” youth employment programme will be devolved from the iron grip of the DWP to councils who know their labour markets. Lack of joined-up government in the silos at the top is reflected in each department’s hotchpotch local delivery.Councils, in their sorry plight, need a monster reorganisation. “Take back control” turns out to be only central control. One local government think-tanker sighs and asks, “But do people care?” Let’s see how much noise the beleaguered red and yellow districts make and how angry Tory MPs will be about their own disappearing districts. Already there are signs of something amiss: the transcript of the speech by the minister for local government, Simon Clarke, in which he set out his devolution plans, was mysteriously taken down from the government’s website soon after it was put there. Just possibly, another rapid retreat by No 10 beckons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ea736c34c432bf4723c6fe77444c43002ef6f41/0_81_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d33f8f0e348bd5fff177c3ccaeaa1e03","title":"almost 40 of english students have a level results downgraded","story":"The combined results issued by the exam boards for England found that a record proportion of school-leavers had received the top A* grade this year, while there was also a big increase in the proportion awarded an A.But the increase in higher grades was not enough to stem mounting dismay among headteachers, with a survey of sixth-form college heads in England reporting that several said this year’s results were the worst in their college’s history.Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “While there has been an overall increase in top grades, we are very concerned that this disguises a great deal of volatility among the results at school and student level.“We have received heartbreaking feedback from school leaders about grades being pulled down in a way that they feel to be utterly unfair and unfathomable. They are extremely concerned about the detrimental impact on their students.”Ofqual described the 2020 exam series as “exceptional” because of the school closures and exam cancellations that followed the coronavirus outbreak in March, forcing it to develop a statistical model to calculate and moderate teacher assessments submitted by schools, in place of formal exams.Gavin Williamson, the education secretary for England, revealed that he has asked exam boards to encourage schools to appeal against their results if they feared disadvantaged candidates were being affected.“There is sometimes a danger where you have an exceptionally high-performing child in a low-performing school to be in a situation where they don’t get the grades that they want to,” Williamson said in an interview with LBC.“What we’ve asked the exam boards is, where they think there may be outliers, is actually to be contacting the schools to talk with them to make sure that appeals are put forward.”Ofqual’s own figures showed that pupils at independent schools received double the improvement in A* and A grades compared with those attending state comprehensives, while sixth-form colleges received only a tiny improvement.A survey of principals conducted by the Sixth Form Colleges Association found “huge variations” between the exam grades predicted by teachers – known as centre-assessed grades – and the final grades students received from Ofqual.“Despite following the guidelines for developing centre assessed grades, colleges reported that the government’s standardisation process had resulted in huge numbers of students receiving lower grades than expected, with some reporting that two thirds of their results had been downgraded,” the association said.Some college heads reported that their results “were the worst since records began”. That was despite earlier assurances by Ofqual that its standardisation process would “ensure national results are broadly similar to previous years”.The head of one sixth-form college in Barnet, north London, said he was disappointed that half of the college’s submitted grades had been revised down, despite the college internally moderating its assessments to fit its results of recent years.Bill Watkin, the chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, said: “Our survey suggests that the government’s model for calculating this year’s A-level grades is flawed and unreliable. A fundamental objective of the process was to ensure year-on-year comparability in exam results – the very clear evidence from our members is that the standardisation model has utterly failed to achieve this.”Ofqual defended its approach, saying: “Without standardisation there was the potential for students to be unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged, depending on the school or college they attended and the approach they took.”The regulator also said it had looked at “potential advantage or disadvantage across different demographic and socioeconomic groups” of its methods. “The analyses show no evidence that this year’s process of awarding grades has introduced bias,” it said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc9863eaae02e87253f5d8c79c846a350f9cb31a/0_24_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=772b790a9e0db98110246288ed41d85a","title":"share your reaction and experiences on a level results day 2020","story":"Whatever your story, and wherever you’re headed next, tell us how you feel about this year’s resultsEmotions will be running high on Thursday as students across the country get their A-level results amid a row over how grades have been calculated due to the Covid pandemic.The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, last night sought to placate pupils and their families by saying he was “incredibly sorry” for the disruption to their education during the coronavirus outbreak.

The butterfly emerges from underground the following summer.The common, which is owned by the National Trust, first required temporary grazing areas for cattle on steep slopes – where they wouldn’t usually choose to go – alongside the removal of scrub, to create ideal conditions for the red ant.Simcox, a research ecologist and the co-author of the commons management plan, said: “The butterfly needs high densities of the heat-loving red ant … which has a crucial role to play in the lifecycle of the butterfly.“The grazing cows create the ideal conditions for them by keeping the grass down so sunlight can reach the soil which gently warms it, creating perfect conditions for the ants, which are cold-blooded and therefore need warmth in order to actively scout for food throughout the spring, summer and autumn.”The reintroduction was a partnership involving the National Trust, Butterfly Conservation, the Back from the Brink project and others. As the climate warms, the large blue should be able to spread northwards, but only if helped to find new habitat.Richard Evans, a ranger for Rodborough and Minchinhampton commons, said: “Butterflies are such sensitive creatures, and with the large blue’s particular requirements they are real barometers for what is happening with our environment and the changing climate.“Creating the right conditions for this globally endangered butterfly to not only survive but to hopefully thrive has been the culmination of many years work. None of this would have been possible without the combined efforts of conservationists and the local graziers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfb711ae30e6102965a643194a5b5750063632d5/0_0_5079_3047/master/5079.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=1dc1e5072aa5abc4fe532122016ecdbb","title":"represent film women in politics","story":"A new film follows three women as they run for office, and the ‘unglamorous bits of democracy’ that make for a political movementThe decision to run for office arrived for Myya Jones in the winter of 2016. She was 22, a campus leader for the Black Student Union at Michigan State University, and determined to change her home town of Detroit for the better. For months, she researched the process of gentrification, which pushed black people out of the neighborhoods where she grew up and went to high school for months, she waited for a name to support. Eventually, she thought, “You know what? I’m going to run for office myself because everybody else is scared,” she told the .For Julie Cho, a 47-year-old married mother of two living in suburban Evanston, Illinois, a majority Democratic district, the decision was fueled by frustration with her state house speaker and the Republican party’s lackluster efforts to campaign in her district. “If no one’s going to do it, then I’m going to do it,” she told the  of her decision to run for state representative. In rural Granville, Ohio, 33-year-old Bryn Bird had long wondered: “If you weren’t afraid, what’s the one thing you would do?” The answer was run for county trustee, but it never seemed like the right time until 2017, when her mother’s cancer turned terminal. “I wanted her to see me run for office,” she told the . “I wasn’t afraid of anything any more.”Represent, a documentary on the tedium of running for local office as a woman in Trump-era America, follows the three women as they launch their nascent political careers in the midwest. The film begins with a clear invocation to opportunities won and lost: in 1974, second-wave feminist activism and the movement to adopt the Equal Rights Amendment launched the so-called Year of the Woman, in which an unprecedented number of women were elected for national office. Forty-four years later, enough had not changed – women still comprised only one in five congressional seats – for another round of “year of the woman” sloganeering. The midterms of 2018 were, indeed, a banner year for women on the national level: 476 House candidates and 53 Senate candidates, more than double the number of women who ran in 2016, largely Democrats spurred to action by the election of a president who once bragged that men should “grab ’em by the pussy”.But while much attention and several stellar documentaries – Netflix’s Knock Down the House on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other progressive rookies in Congress, Hulu’s Hillary on the presidential candidate herself – beamed on the national races, Represent seeks to explore the same phenomenon in less storied, pared-down quarters. “These are everyday women,” director Hillary Bachelder told the , “the yous and mes of the world who are like, ‘I can do this small thing for my community at this level.’”The local and state house races “should be the most accessible for women”, Bachelder said. But the barriers for entry – the mental tax of microaggressions and snap judgments, especially for Jones as a black women and Cho as a Korean immigrant, and the lack of funding for new candidates from the party organizations – demonstrate “a lot of the same thing that’s at the national level”.Bachelder embedded with each candidate, following the distinctly unglamorous work of campaigning in their specific districts – the trips to knock on doors, shake hands at the town parade, to show up to sparsely attended municipal meetings, to flag people down in cars and explain your platform or, more often, who you are.While the three races present starkly different contexts, the touch-and-go, bespoke work of each campaign confront frustratingly similar doubts and dismissals. For Bird, running as the “new by, like, decades” trustee, as she says in the film, it was confronting an old boy’s club that did not take her seriously, the “continual cycle of not being told about certain things, or being reminded that I can’t go to certain events, or not invited to the men’s drinking nights because I need to get home to my kids”.Bachelder’s camera captures the compounding toll of unnecessary discomfort – another candidate, for example, saying he’d make a joke but it wouldn’t be “politically correct” enough for Bird’s presence. At a Democratic meet-and-greet, one white woman touches Jones’s hair without permission.For Cho, whose family escaped North Korea during the war in the 1950s, her allegiance to the Republican party is more complicated than the label would seem. She distrusts all governments, she says, but wants to do her part to help. She’s attached to the Republican name under the Trump administration, which has worked to systematically curb voting rights, but her main platform is ending gerrymandered district lines in her corner of Illinois. Her campaign manager is a black man who has never worked for a Republican before. Occasionally, people in Evanston hear her out more often, she’s dismissed outright.She’s frequently had people – all white liberals, she told the , demanding to know why she’d run as a Republican as an Asian immigrant. “It’s white people telling me how I should think,” she said. “What they should be asking is what is it about the Republican platform and policies that you support?”Jones, in particular, faces the most interlocking and insidious friction as a young black female candidate. In news interviews, she’s asked why she thinks she has enough experience canvassing the street, one constituent demands: “what are you going to do about the blight?!” In one scene, Jones attends a conference for aspiring candidates, but is only given 15 seconds to introduce herself publicly. Black women “do a lot of the groundwork, a lot of the legwork, we have a lot of ideas, but it’s not until we’re like 30+ that we are actually recognized as leaders,” said Jones. “People don’t perceive us as being just as knowledgable or as capable as them.”“You’re asking people to have to suit up, to have the thick skin and enter a space that you know wasn’t built for you,” said Bachelder of the challenges faced by all three women. “The added level of being reminded that you’re an other in some kind of way is just going chip away.” By film’s end, after defeats in both the mayoral bid and a Democratic primary for state House, Jones, now 25 and studying for her MBA, was “tired of having to prove myself over and over again” and conflicted over the potential of running for office, especially without financial backing from the party.“Just as much as you want black folks to vote for you, specifically black women,” she said, “you have to be able to financially back our campaigns, too.”Cho, who lost her race for state house, also remains on the fence about seeking elected office she’s spending time at home with her young children. In one of the film’s most poignant scenes, Bird informs her mother that she’s won the race, initiating a separate round of challenges: working 20 hours or more a week as a trustee for $10,000 a year with three little kids, a husband working full-time, and a family farm business whose customers she can’t afford to alienate.The structural and cultural challenges remain, Bachelder said, but there’s hope to be found in number and tenacity, especially on politics’ bluntest and most specific level. After two years on the local campaign trail, the film “shines the light on the need for all of us to get engaged and involved”, she said – a call to action for involvement in “the unglamorous bits of democracy that are still really necessary to bring the pieces together”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7688119cd221130fe20d8ed0041218bf34864bb5/0_314_5848_3510/master/5848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0b3b1472e35e350d3f103d8c377702c","title":"peace where rights arent trampled afghan womens demands ahead of taliban talks","story":"With negotiations set to begin, women have been sharing their ‘red lines’ on the progress they refuse to see negotiatedFarahnaz Forotan was three when the Taliban had arrived in Kabul. It was 1996. “I have this memory of a snowy day, I was sitting on my mother’s lap, in a minibus, and she was crying. I didn’t understand why she was crying,” Forotan says. It was the day her family became refugees.“It was the civil war, and we had to leave our home and country to live in Iran – alive, but living in pain and facing discrimination,” she says.Now Forotan, whose family returned to Afghanistan in 2001, is making sure the militants who disrupted her childhood don’t use the upcoming peace talks to roll back gains women have made.“Today, the US and the world are surrendering us to the group that still kills us every day … in our streets, in our schools and even in our homes. We have been numbed into silence, by war, violence and pain, for far too long. But now we want to shout,” says Forotan.Talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government could start in Qatar this week, after the grand assembly, under pressure from the US, agreed on Sunday to release 400 militant prisoners, a Taliban condition for joining the negotiations.Many women fear that freedoms gained in the 20 years since the fall of the Taliban will be sacrificed in the talks. Just five women are included in the 21-member negotiating team.Looking away from Forotan’s camera to protect her identity, a middle-aged woman from Helmand, one of the provinces worst hit by conflict, speaks in one of the videos:“I want peace that lasts. A five-day peace is not good for me or anyone. I was whipped in public once while taking my sick child to the doctor. When I asked the man why he hit me, he told me not to leave the house without a man. My husband is disabled, I am the breadwinner of the family. How can I not leave the house? We want permanent peace in which women’s rights are not trampled.”Nagina Anwari, a software engineer, is helping with the campaign. She says the peace process scares her. “I am scared because we are represented by only a few symbolic figures negotiating a possible return of the Taliban on my behalf.”Anwari, who is from Kandahar, once the capital of the regime, says memories of the Taliban’s atrocities are still fresh.“The girl in Kabul is struggling to make ends meet and seeking equal rights, while the girl in the village stays awake all night because she can no longer go to school and must get married forcefully. Their circumstances are different so their demands are different,” she says.“Another woman who had been married three times in the same house first to her husband’s brother after he was killed, then again to the younger brother after the second one was killed. What is left of her but an empty and desolate body that was scarified to war and ignorance?” she says.But Forotan also gathered stories of strength. “I witnessed women who have gone through all these hardships and are still working tirelessly so their children can study. I was left speechless meeting girls who so boldly challenged the stereotypes of society in their male-dominated cities,” she says.Afghan women, she says, are not just worried about their own rights. “Women are worried about the order and structure that we’ve achieved so far in the last 20 years. Even if it has its shortcomings, it is worth saving. These are not feminine or masculine demands they are the general concerns among the people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1362c98327ec76a390723e8eda4f98594ad1d920/0_45_3780_2268/master/3780.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=5638e8abb7e653e0ae5bfbaea4d8091a","title":"uk passengers barred from flights to greece over confusing covid forms","story":"Holidaymakers hit by problems with contact-tracing rules and varying airline interpretationsDozens of holidaymakers have been barred from boarding flights from the UK to Greece because of confusing red tape caused by the coronavirus.In July the Greek government announced that all passengers must submit a personal locator form including their travel and contact details 48 hours before departure. They are then emailed a QR code, which must be downloaded and presented at check-in.The details are used for contact tracing in the event of a Covid-19 outbreak and arrivals who fail to comply face a €500 fine.However, delays in receiving the code and differing interpretations of the rules by airlines have led to passengers being turned away at the airport.Some travellers claim that their airline did not inform them of the new requirements or that minor form-filling errors cost them their holiday.Karoki Lewis and his family were forbidden to board their easyJet flight to Kefalonia because he had not included the names of his two young children on the form.“It appears to be impossible to add more than two passengers on the form many other families have been affected because they only managed to enter the parents’ details,” he said.“I pointed out that small children would obviously be with their parents throughout their holiday and therefore would be easily contactable for any Covid-19 tracing but I was told that even if we were allowed on the flight, the Greek authorities would send us straight home.”The family spent £1,000 on new flights and accommodation a week later. EasyJet said it provides clear guidance to passengers by email, text and Flight Tracker when they book a flightConflicting advice on official websites has caused many passengers to fall foul of the rules.The Greek government website initially stated that all passengers over 18 had to fill out separate forms this month the advice was changed to allow households to fill out a single form and the deadline was changed to 24 hours before departure.However, a confusing layout has left some passengers unclear how to add more than two names to the online form and some airlines are still insisting that each adult must submit separate forms. Carriers face steep fines if they transport passengers with inadequate documents.Last week Wizz Air offloaded 28 passengers from a flight to Athens, citing inadequately completed forms. Several were denied boarding because they had not included their middle names, even though this is marked optional on the form. The airline has since admitted an error.“As a matter of priority, we are investigating whether any passengers were wrongfully denied carriage on the flight as a result of not including a middle name on their PLF, despite correctly completing the rest of the form,” a spokesperson said.“Should there be any affected passengers, Wizz Air will contact them directly to apologise and offer the relevant compensation, as well as the options of rebooking or refunding their ticket.”The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) website confirms that only one form and QR code is required for each household but warns that some airlines insist on separate submissions and advises passengers to check with their airline what documents they need to show. In a nod to the form’s confusing layout, it also details how to add more than two family members.A spokesperson for the Greek embassy denied that delays in sending QR codes have grounded passengers and stated that it is the airlines’ responsibility to ensure that passengers have the correct paperwork.Other European countries, including the UK, require travellers from certain regions to complete health declarations or locator forms for contact tracing and passengers are being urged to check the FCO website when booking flights to ensure they comply."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db2f8244fbe318fb6e24c994d3b0e977c3e640d4/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=eb4e600d42e76cadd594373fcd21782c","title":"a post pandemic guide for retailers think of your customers as your biggest fans","story":"Lockdown has shown us that people will support the brands they want to succeed – a business expert’s advice to store ownersThe retail sector has been in flux for some time and, post coronavirus, there’s more uncertainty to come.“There is a lot of talk about ‘returning to normal’ or of the ‘new normal’, but prior to the pandemic the only normal was that everything was changing,” says business consultant Neil Gibb. The pandemic has simply accelerated that transformation, he said ahead of a British Retail Consortium webinar on the impact of Covid-19.Even an industry that has weathered its fair share of storms has never seen an event of this size and significance, and it’s becoming clear that the rules of engagement are changing. As retailers navigate uncharted waters, these are the rules that matter right now:Put safety firstAbove all, responsible businesses have to prioritise safety, both for staff and customers. According to Kyle Monk, head of retail insights and analytics at the British Retail Consortium, retailers are working hard on both implementing safety measures and communicating them clearly. Luckily, technology is on our side when it comes to designing systems that put safety first, but not at the expense of the customer experience. He cites a technology company that has shop assistants available by video screen in-store. The remote shop assistants can engage with you in a similar way in which they would normally.While it may seem at first that the new retail environment will not make the most fun of shopping experiences, with creativity, innovation and by utilising tech, companies can get the balance right.Be collaborative“The scale of the pandemic and the speed with which we’ve had to adopt a new way of living has left many of us feeling uncertain – especially retailers,” says Andrew Lawson, senior vice-president EMEA for Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. The good news, however, is that a sense of optimism is emerging as businesses deal successfully with unstable operating conditions. “We’ve seen incredible stories of resilience coming out of the pandemic, as retailers and their suppliers band together to maintain the flow of goods,” says Lawson.This collaborative spirit will be important for the industry if it is to retain momentum, share best practice and agree about what support may be needed from the government. “It’s kind of unprecedented,” says Monk. “I don’t think, to be honest, any other industry is coordinating in the way that retail is at the moment.”PrioritiseWhile some retailers have launched e-commerce platforms in record time – one European chain that had around 1,000 stores but no e-commerce platform, managed to launch one in 13 weeks – Lawson suggests that incremental digital transformation might be the better way forward. Zendesk is finding that many of its customers are reluctant to invest time and money in total digital transformation when there is still so much uncertainty. “The priority is to identify solutions that can deliver returns on investment quickly,” he says. “For example, by looking at an omnichannel approach, you can bring all the information you have on a customer together in one place. This will provide your marketing and sales teams with invaluable insights.”Support your staffWe may never return to business as usual but, according to Lawson, companies can move forward by supporting and listening to feedback from staff. He also emphasises the connection between a happy and valued workforce, and the ability to be agile, scalable and resilient. “By helping employees adapt to new systems and processes through training and regular communication, and by really listening to feedback, the new styles and systems that we work under really can work for everyone,” he says.Appeal to your fansThere has never been a better time for companies to revisit their core purpose – building a trusted and valued brand. Research from Zendesk shows that customers have been more patient during the pandemic. While the volume of service requests and wait times have gone up, customer satisfaction remains fairly steady, indicating brand loyalty. Customers will support the brands that they want to succeed, says Monk.And Gibb believes successful retailers won’t have customers going forward, they’ll have loyal fans – people who care deeply about what that brand really stands for. For decision-makers in the retail business, who feel that the ground is constantly shifting beneath them, focusing on purpose could provide a much needed stable foundation.Things are changing fast.

Now everyone faces a new issue: how to return to some semblance of business normality.“The world of work – particularly how we think about work and how we think about where we work, has fundamentally shifted,” says coach and productivity expert Karen Eyre-White. “A lot of businesses have been in crisis mode. What we’re seeing now is them having to get back to a new normal with strategy, boundaries and structure in place.”Some things haven’t changed. As before, high productivity will be a priority – particularly given the gloomy economic predictions. Achieving it depends on motivation, training and technology, time management and support from others. But how can businesses make sure they have these essentials in place as we move out of lockdown and get back to work?Have clarity of purposeWith so much uncertainty around, business leaders need to reassure staff by projecting confidence and clarity wherever possible. “Try to be certain about as much as you can,” says Eyre-White, whether that involves scheduling regular catch-up meetings, or deciding the office won’t reopen until next year. Managers can boost their own productivity and that of their team by being clear about their priorities for any given day or week, and encouraging others to do the same.Aligning those priorities with the company’s objectives will keep even a remote team moving in the right direction, says Chris Bailey, author of Hyperfocus: How to Work Less to Achieve More. “The greatest challenge that businesses face in normal times is orienting what everybody’s working on toward what the purpose of the business is … and that’s still the case,” he says. “The more intentional we are about how we work and what we work on, the more productive we become.”Where priorities have changed, it’s important to communicate that effectively to staff, says Sarah Manning, senior HR director at Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. “I can’t imagine many organisations didn’t have to pivot in some way in lockdown. Leaders need to be really clear now about what the expectation of their teams are going to be and put in measures to help people adapt.”Empower staff to find their way of workingProductivity can be difficult to measure, but focusing on the tasks achieved rather than the hours someone is at their desk can boost efficiency. Despite reports that lockdown led to an upsurge in demand for workforce surveillance tools, Eyre-White says that such an approach is unlikely to be effective. “Inidually, everyone needs to do different things in order to be productive,” she adds. “I just do not see how a surveillance system is compatible with that.”Instead, businesses should be encouraging staff to find what works for them – some people might be most productive if they go for a walk in the morning, others might take short breaks after 45 minutes of focused work, while some team members might need to work around a young family at home.Projecting empathy for the circumstances many of us find ourselves in is important, says Manning. Particularly at present. “Life is crazy right now. I think employers need to acknowledge that.”Promote good communicationWhen it comes to managing virtual teams, good communication is key to ensuring staff feel supported and informed. “Once a company has made a decision, communicate it clearly,” says Manning. “You need to be careful not to go out with half a message and cause a whole lot of anxiety for people.”Keeping communication channels open can promote a culture of collaboration.Apps such as Zoom, Slack, other digital tools and internal help desks can help ensure “people still feel engaged, connected and therefore invested”, says Manning. Zendesk, for example, has held remote quizzes, yoga classes and Friday night drinks during lockdown. There are other examples of companies holding digital book clubs, remote murder mystery games, and scavenger hunts.“Anything you can do as a manager to foster meaningful connections between employees will go a long way,” Bailey says.It’s OK to have down timeStaff may be working from home, but it’s important not to encourage an “always on” culture that blurs the boundaries between work life and home life, Eyre-White says. “There’s this idea of e-presenteeism and needing to be seen,” she adds. “Staff can’t be seen in the office so they may feel they need to be replying to their emails or messages instantly. And that’s not how you get productive work done. You need time away from those things. Businesses need to be clear that it’s OK.”One way to set the tone is to offer training to managers to help them adapt to working with, and supporting, remote teams. Simple measures can set an example, such as resisting the temptation to email outside work hours, and blocking out time for breaks on a calendar that the team has access to.No one should feel guilty about taking a break from work, says Bailey. “Focusing on things all day long is one of the worst things we can do because our mind just needs a chance to wander. Mind the guilt that you experience around relaxation and know that it’s a phenomenon most of us experience.”Embrace flexibilityAlongside the difficulties of the past few months, for many firms there have also been opportunities for lasting change.“If going remote didn’t kill a business, companies are going to have to decide their answer when employees ask: ‘Can I work from home?’” Manning says. “There are huge benefits from a cost perspective … and I do think companies can potentially attract more candidates and more ersity.”Staying flexible – and that might mean some staff work remotely in the long term – will help foster an inclusive, productive culture that has broader benefits.“This has definitely opened our eyes up to those different possibilities,” Manning adds. “We are going to have a much more flexible approach to where people can work and how they work.”Things are changing fast.

A huge drop in sales during March seemed to sound the death knell for at least some sectors of the industry. Online sales, on the other hand, have rocketed and new approaches are emerging among those retailers that are learning to be agile.“Covid-19 has really accelerated a bunch of inevitables. A lot of things are just happening a lot faster,” says Steve Hewett, global vice president for retail customer experience at the tech and consultancy firm Capgemini.For many companies, online is exploding. “This was already happening,” says Hewett. “But some companies are achieving the sort of online growth in weeks that they expected in three or four years.”This has implications for how companies do business, and it’s likely to be crucial to be able to deliver a hybrid onlineoffline experience to the post-Covid-19 customer. Here are five trends currently reshaping the retail sector:Brands are getting chattierIt seems that customers engaged with brands more during lockdown. “For years, buying something meant going to a physical place, seeing the branding in the store and understanding who that brand is,” says Adrian McDermott, president of products at Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. “We need to establish the digital equivalents of finding, meeting and having those conversations.”Prices could remain “sticky”Rajesh Bhargave, a consumer behaviour expert, suggests that retailers need to be wary of changing their prices – whether up or down. “Consumers tend to remember what they paid previously and would view price increases as unjust in poor economic conditions.”Dropping prices is not always the answer either. Many consumers will have taken a financial hit and their wallets will be closed for concessionary spending. A knee-jerk reaction might be to cut prices to bring back that demand but, says Bhargave, associate professor of marketing at Imperial College Business School in London, this could have negative long-term effects and erode pricing power: “If you’ve been paying £10 for a meal and suddenly that’s £8 you start to wonder about the quality of the meal.”Brands have to add valueInstead of dropping prices, brands are likely to start looking at different ways to add value, says Bhargave. “If people want to dine at restaurants, they might want a more private and safe experience,” he says. “So how can you start offering a different service that charges a higher price and offers better value?”Video calling is another area that business is only starting to explore. “With so much taking place on Zoom, is there a higher-end service you can provide in this area?” Selfridges, for example, is offering online beauty and styling appointments, with products then delivered to customers at home.This is part of a move towards getting more revenue from fewer people, and appointments for in-store shopping also fall into this category. “It’s all part of offering a more customised, high-end experience,” says Bhargave.To bring the joy back into shopping, some stores are putting their energies into their window displays to encourage browsing and others are providing queue entertainment.The need for a new kind of agilityThings may never be the same. “We’ve almost got to hit the reset button,” says Hewett. “People are returning to school and the office and there’s no playbook on what the wants and needs are.” Moreover, whatever they are could change dramatically again. Hewett adds: “There’s an organisational need for agility that wasn’t there before, as brands aren’t able to be as tactical as they would like.”Things are changing fast. But you can be faster.

Despite government support, having to close their doors for months had a crippling effect on many and forced them to take action to keep afloat.For Steve Sanderson, founder of the independent menswear retailer Oi Polloi, lockdown pressed fast forward on an already tough situation for small businesses. The company’s store in Manchester has always been at its heart, but it also has a strong online and social presence. “Bricks and mortar operations are really difficult,” he says. “What’s going on at the moment is sort of a super fast wormhole journey into the future.”Sanderson says that things are going to be particularly tough for fashion stores, with an inevitable drop in footfall, plus the issues of being Covid-19-secure, such as being unable to let customers try on clothes unless the items are quarantined or cleaned afterwards. “If people can’t try things on, why would they come in to a clothes shop?” he asks.There are, though, some rays of hope. “We have a good connection with customers through our bricks and mortar business, and certain people will always like that. But we can’t afford to just be open – we have to find a way of making it work.“We’ll have to adapt and become something else, something people can’t get from anywhere else. I like the idea of click and collect because you can do something quite interesting with that. You could then also narrow down the time the store itself is open.”For Michelle Drew, co-founder of Established 25 Atelier, which sells fashion and home accessories, the coronavirus crisis forced her to reassess her ambitions. Before lockdown, Drew, who started in 2017 making scarves and bags for friends and family, was selling at a quarterly design market in Greenwich and had a monthly stall at Spitalfields market. When Covid-19 brought things grinding to a halt, her first thought was that she needed to get her website up and running, and really engage online. “I didn’t have a choice,” she says.Since then, Drew has joined online workshops and used the time to rethink her plans. “Previously, I thought I’d love to collaborate with other designers and have a premises. I’m now wondering if that’s the way forward, because so much has changed and I’m not sure things will ever be the same.”While Drew plans to return to physical selling at some point, she sees her business relying more on online trading. “It’s still a precarious situation. I definitely will return to the markets because I enjoy the contact, but I’m looking at other ways to move the business forward.”Bigger retailers, too, have faced challenges, for all their greater resources. Some have come through with flying colours, though, particularly if they had the right technology to hand.For Tesco, the coronavirus crisis brought an unprecedented surge in demand, but the company was well placed to react quickly. It already had emergency plans in place thanks to a “doomsday” management exercise four years ago. It had also embraced remote working, and had the technology to handle communication with 460,000 staff, suppliers, people services and security operations. These systems allowed the company to double its capacity for delivery and click and collect in just six weeks. Improvements to the computer algorithms used to drive picking technology – plus the army of pickers hired to cope with the increased demand – mean that whatever the future brings, the chain appears to have the flexibility to deal with it.Similarly, the online flower delivery company Bloom \u0026amp Wild proved its resilience. For its founder Aron Gelbard, protecting jobs by staying open was important, as was providing people with a way of showing they care for the loved ones they couldn’t see in lockdown.With its tailored CRM system, which manages queries from a range of channels, Bloom \u0026amp Wild now employs more than 25 customer service agents who manage between 3,000 and 3,500 inquiries every week – rising dramatically during peak times such as Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day and, undoubtedly, lockdown.The company uses Zendesk to manage its customer relationships, allowing agents to deal with inquiries across Twitter, email, phone, online chat, Facebook Messenger and SMS. Alongside this, analytics help the company forecast customer demand and plan for peaks.As a business that exists purely in the virtual world, it’s an example to retailers everywhere of what can be achieved by clever use of technology.Things are changing fast.

My father had locked himself in the toilet for four hours and wasn’t responding to anyone. My brother and I listened at the door. Nothing. The person at the other end of the 999 call had a volley of questions: “Why did he choose the toilet? Does he have a weapon? Do you think he is suicidal?” I replied with don’t know, no and no. They wanted his rejection of life to be defined as an absolute, but it was far more shadowy and ambiguous.Panicked, I called a mental health crisis helpline too, who advised me to connect with my father through the toilet door. “Speak louder, put some force into the words,” he told me, as though I was auditioning for a part. My dad did not reply. It had been hours since I had last heard his voice, fragile, fading to a whisper. My younger brother was trying his best to help. After rummaging through a toolbox, he found a screwdriver to force between door and lock. White flakes of paint flew the door swung open and there was my father. He was wearing his pyjamas, standing upright, his body locked into a strange, repetitive loop. His left arm would rise, jerk above his head, then his right foot would lift, and the mechanical process would begin all over again. His face was scarlet, screwed into a fist of agony.When the ambulance crew arrived, we had difficulty communicating his illness. Catatonia, we explained, uncertainty in our voices. Even his doctors seemed puzzled by the state he had become prone to slipping into: a sort of waking coma, where he was conscious but his body became disconnected. In the days that followed, he was sectioned in a psychiatric ward. He could not walk, eat, speak or see, only hear. The nurses were feeding him but I worried about him becoming dehydrated, and when I visited I took along a bottle of fancy juice, put a straw into his mouth and coaxed him to drink. The sight of liquid seeping up the straw, the sound of it against his teeth and tongue, was a wild relief. It was also one of the few ways I could reach through the bars of his catatonia cage and find a way to communicate. His fists kept flying up involuntarily and hammering on the arms of his chair. I held his hands tight and spoke to him of better times, when he would be well again it was also a way of reassuring myself. The last time he’d had a catatonic collapse, he’d taken months to heal. There was no certainty that he would recover on this occasion.“Are you his carer?” It was a question that I kept being asked around this time. I usually replied: “Well, no, I’m his daughter.” I found the term carer puzzling and wondered why people were trying to pin it on to me. It made me think of nurses, white gowns, Florence Nightingale it made me feel I ought to have specialist medical knowledge and infinite reserves of compassion. Of course, I did care about my father I was desperately worried about him. But I did not consider myself as someone worthy of an official title of responsibility. I was in my late 30s, based in the north, a full-time writer, living a peripatetic, financially precarious existence. My father was in his early 70s and lived in London, alone after the death of my mother, his days bookended by the taking of medicines and filled with quiet habits: reading the paper, doing the odd shop, cooking himself a poached egg for dinner each night.He fell ill when I was three years old. He had always been a playful, loving father. Subsequently he seemed lost to us. He had been sectioned after being made redundant and suffering a nervous breakdown during his stay in the psychiatric ward, he developed schizophrenia. Open a textbook and you’ll find a list of symptoms for the illness – withdrawal, loss of desires, hallucinations, hearing voices – but it affects each person differently. For us, there was a sense of my father withdrawing from the world, becoming a silent, mysterious observer, almost wraithlike.With my father now back in the psychiatric ward, I tried to visit him every day. I liaised with doctors, played Scrabble with him, read to him from the paper, took bags of his clothes home, washed them, carried them back. The nights grew shorter, daffodils springing up on the lawns that framed the ward. The day he started speaking again was euphoric: the first major sign of recovery. Before my mother had died, my relationship with him had been virtually non-existent. Now I found myself becoming closer to him, discovering what a kind and sweet man he was beneath his quiet persona. A tenderness blossomed between us.As he grew better, I went into decline. My workload was heavy. By the end of each day I wanted to curl up foetal in bed with exhaustion, and the walk to the bus stop, the start of my journey to visit him, became a trudge.It was a lonely time. My partner of three years was based in the north, anchored there by his daughter from a previous relationship. Insomnia set in. I would wake in the early hours, worried about Dad, about work deadlines I was failing to meet on four or five hours sleep I fumbled through white-fuzz days. If I was a carer, I thought, then I’m failing at this task. It was a relief when, one night on the ward, I heard a man cheerfully saying to his sick wife: “I’m glad they’ve let me change my shifts, when I was on night duty visiting you every day nearly killed me.” Eventually, I cut back on work in order to devote more time to my father, but then my finances suffered. Bankruptcy became a genuine threat.When my father was released, the relief came: now life can go back to normal. But a few months later, I was working downstairs at the dining table when I heard the sound of water pitter-pattering on the floor. My father had been at the sink, washing his hands, when he collapsed into catatonia. As I returned to a routine of visits and doctors’ discussions, my relationship collapsed. By choosing to stay south for the past year, I had put my father ahead of my boyfriend. It had not felt like a conscious decision. Caring had always felt like something that happened to me, not a choice I’d made. I realised that life was never going to be “normal” again.My father is much better these days, for I have moved in with him permanently. There are times when I feel sad about my love life being compromised, days when I wish I had the freedom to travel or live abroad, but I cherish the close bond between us and the fierce, protective love for him that has taken root in my heart. Being called a carer is something I have grown used to.• Sam Mills is author of The Fragments of My Father: A Memoir of Madness, Love and Being a Carer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fc141175bfb7b30d8aa2c73776c9c29d40a794e/61_0_3446_2068/master/3446.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e1cfd6b26ba0ef4bc68159ff50548ae","title":"cricket england pakistan second test day one live","story":"There’s no immediate prospect of play. The rain has stopped but it is extremely gloomy.“Dear old thing, you can’t talk about Abdul Qadir without contextualising,” says Robert Wilson. “It’s about the pitches on which he played. The least leggie-friendly ever. It was the era of seam or nuttin’. Even swing bowling seemed a little 1940s. We had forgotten that leggies existed. Qadir was like some Jeeves and Wooster character popping up in the middle of The Great Rock ‘n Roll Swindle. Every last atom of ground prep was to maximise seamer advantage. He bowled on something worse than roads and got a lot of tap because of it. But when he sang, he soared. You know it’s true.”I’ll see your purple prose and raise you a hardcore stat. He took over 70 per cent of his wickets in Pakistan, which suggests not all pitches were unfriendly. I agree that he single-lippedly gave mystery spin the kiss of life for almost the entirety of the 1980s. He got 216 Test wickets in the decade no other wristspinner managed 50.“Hi Rob,” says Steve Pye. “Just to let people know - the Test highlights are on BBC Four tonight at 7.”“Re. the debate about Archer,” begins David Murray. “Has he really been ‘treated with a thundering lack of empathy’? Is there any evidence he was being overbowled against his will or better judgement? There seems to be an implication that not only the tabloid press but Root or other management are also a bit racist. Again, I don’t deny the possibility but if that is the charge then it’s a strong one and I’m not really sure what the evidence is. Are there inside sources we don’t know about, or I haven’t heard?”I don’t think the general attitude is born of racism, more a suspicion of outsiders that has been evident throughout my cricket-watching lifetime. I should made it clearer – the empathy comment referred more to the general tone of suspicion in the media (traditional and social), and the ludicrous overreaction to his good and bad days. I’ve been guilty of that too, certainly on his good days – I think I wrote last summer that he might already be the best England bowler I’ve ever seen, which seems ridiculous now, though he has the necessary. I don’t think Root is a great captain and I think he has misused Archer at times, but that and a couple of awkward post-match interviews were all I was referring to I’ve no reason to believe there is any kind of dressing-room problem to compare with the back end of Kevin Pietersen’s career. The reason I mentioned Eoin Morgan is simply because he has a degree in people and I think it would help Archer to spend a bit of time in his team. And he’d only have to bowl four-over spells, which might help with his elbow.“Re: Abdul Qadir’s high average,” says Avitaj Mitra. “It’s pretty common for legwristspinners to have higher averages (above thirty) because they tend to bowl a lot more loose balls (because they rely on their wrist for spin, sacrificing control) compared to offspinners who have better control because they rely on spin generated from fingers. Hence why Shane Warne was so freakishly good, with his ability to bowl long spells without bad deliveries.”Yes, that sums it perfectly. But I find it still jars slightly, even though I know it shouldn’t. Kumble is an interesting one - a completely different type of legspinner, but his economy rate of 2.69 was terrific.“Tuffers may have been (and still is IMHO) many things,” says Charles Sheldrick. “But no one, not even the man himself should ever get away with calling him ordinary…”I think the story was in Mike Atherton’s autobiography, though I might have added the ‘fakkin’.Edit: yes, here we go, page 201 of the paperback.Phil Tufnell was constantly in a flap. For a start, Warne spun the ball twice as far as Tufnell, who often looked innocuous in comparison. ‘That bloke’s making me look crap! He’s ruing my career!’ Tufnell constantly complained.“Does anyone know why the BBC have put the highlights back to 11:30 in the evening?” asks Martin Shepherd. “Surely after all the fanfare about the BBC getting cricket back on terrestrial TV after all this time, they haven’t given up on the 7:00 slot already!!!”I didn’t know that had happened, but it certainly merits three exclamation marks. It might be temporary measure because of the snooker.45.4 overs: Pakistan 126-5 (Babar Azam 25, Mohammad Rizwan 4) A storm is coming, Frank said. In fact, it’s already here. After four balls of Woakes’ over, the last of which swerves past Rizwan’s outside edge, rain stops play once again.45th over: Pakistan 124-5 (Babar Azam 24, Mohammad Rizwan 3) If they’re not careful, Pakistan will lose the series in this session. It’s been a story of good“Hi Rob,” says Pete Salmon. “An afternoon of cricket and discussions of quotation marks – basically my dream, what with being a copy-editor and all. Recently came across the wonderful Richard Ayoade correctly using three apostrophes in a row, viz - doubt, disorientation and infinite rage are not within ‘Don’t Stop Believin’’’s mandate. Of course as you are quoting me quoting him while following the OBO style guide, it is even better: ‘doubt, disorientation and infinite rage are not within “Don’t Stop Believin’’”s mandate.’ I also like cricket.”I usually proofread every email before publishing, but we have no Paracetamol in the house so I think I’ll give this one a miss. Okay, I couldn’t help myself - in the first example, shouldn’t there be two apostrophes? I’m sure I’m missing something, and I’ll be sure to blame it on the brain-melting challenges of OBOing rather than my failure to re-read Eats, Shoots \u0026amp Leaves once a year.43.5 overs: Pakistan 120-4 (Babar Azam 23, Fawad Alam 0) Chris Woakes replaces Sam Curran. Pakistan are one wicket away from a predicament, though you wouldn’t know iut from the seremity of Babar’s batting. He works Woakes confidently for three before the left-handed Fawad survives a big shout for LBW. England are gong to review. I reckon it pitched outside leg.43rd over: Pakistan 117-4 (Babar Azam 20, Fawad Alam 0) Fawad Alam, whose last Test appearance in 2009, is the new batsman. He has spent the last 11 years sculpting a mighty first-class average of 56.78. He has a bizarre stance - he starts square-on, not unlike Shivarine Chanderpaul, and then walks into a side-on position when the bowler is in his delivery stride.Goddim. Shafiq pushes at a good delivery from Broad and edges low to third slip, where Sibley gets down smartly to take the catch. Shafiq is a high-class batsman with only one weakness: he doesn’t score enough runs.42nd over: Pakistan 113-3 (Babar Azam 20, Asad Shafiq 1) An errant delivery from Curran deflects away for three leg byes. Meanwhile, cricket was fun these last 143 years.“Yasir Shah is a touch over five and a half wickets per Test,” says Romeo. “I may have mentioned this to you before. I have to everyone else.”It’s quite surprising to see he has an average in the thirties. Mind you so did Abdul Qadir, and he was the genius’s genius.41st over: Pakistan 106-3 (Babar Azam 17, Asad Shafiq 0) Broad replaces Anderson, who stays in the game by making an excellent stop at mid-on. England are bowling superbly just now, and Broad beats Babar all ends up with a vicious legcutter. Even Bradman would have struggled to nick that.40th over: Pakistan 104-3 (Babar Azam 15, Asad Shafiq 0) Curran is bowling an excellent line to the new batsman Shafiq, on or around fourth stump for the most part. Another maiden. “Sometimes,” says Emma John, “I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion.”I’m voting for Dukakis.39th over: Pakistan 104-3 (Babar Azam 15, Asad Shafiq 0) Babar is beaten thrice during an excellent over from Anderson that also includes an edge along the ground for a couple. Anderson was fortunate to play in this game but he has been close to his best. 38th over: Pakistan 102-3 (Babar Azam 13, Asad Shafiq 0) Asad Shafiq is beaten by his first ball. Curran has good figures of 8-1-19-1.I don’t know whether he’s a golden arm on legs, a Chaminda Vaas tribute in the making or what, but Sam Curran always seems to make things happen. He has picked up Abid Ali for 60 with a nice piece of bowling. Curran followed a series of full, straight deliveries with a back-of-a-length ball angled across Adif Ali, who fenced it to second slip. Really good bowling, that. “He’s outfoxed him,” says Wasim Akram on commentary.Let’s all keep writing Sam Curran off, shall we.37th over: Pakistan 96-2 (Abid Ali 54, Babar Azam 13) Babar Azam plays a beautiful stroke, jumping back in his crease to caress Anderson through midwicket for four. “Following up Karl’s point,” says Philip Rebbeck, “if you are comparing Tufnell to Warne the more salient point would be wickets per test. Warne took nearly 5 wickets per Test throughout his career, which is extraordinary, the Cat fewer than 3.”Oh, I don’t think anyone was comparing them overall, just in terms of economy rate. Even Tufnell didn’t do that, except to lament that that fella’s making me look fakkin ordinary. 36th over: Pakistan 89-2 (Abid Ali 51, Babar Azam 9) There’s a soupcon of swing for Curran, no more than that, and Babar Azam deals with him comfortably. As admirable (and matchwinning) a cricketer as Curran is, I can’t help thinking England should have picked Ollie Robinson or Mark Wood. I told you, I can’t help it!35th over: Pakistan 87-2 (Abid Ali 51, Babar Azam 7) Abid Ali edges Anderson short of slip and through for a couple of runs. That takes him to a fiercely determined fifty, the first of his Test career (he has two hundreds and an average of 81, which takes the sting out of that potential statgasm). He is beaten off the last ball of the over, fencing needlessly at a back-of-a-length delivery outside off.“I’ve just noticed Tim’s reference to Doug Bollinger and his hilarious hot hair piece, and other cricketers who have spotted rugs,” says Steve Hudson. “Does anyone else remember Didier Camberabero, the French fly half, who turned up to the 1991 rugby world cup with a very obvious wig? Amazingly, no-one managed to pull it off, which is incredible.”Have we mentioned the bald Sanath Jayasuriya, who was bald, dislocating his shoulder while reaching for the shampoo, while bald? I used to find this entirely hilarious until the day arrived and I realised that, yep, even bald men use shampoo for the bits at the side.34th over: Pakistan 85-2 (Abid Ali 49, Babar Azam 7) Curran has one delivery remaining in his sixth over. It’s a wide yorker that is defended by Abid Ali.Tea was taken at 3.40pm, as scheduled, which means we’ll have a bumper evening session: about four or five days. (Okay, a maximum of three hours.)I make the statistics slightly different (career economy rate 2.42, 2.37 in the 1990s) but it’s still an excellent spot. It doesn’t surprise me he had a decent economy rate, though I’m surprised it was that good. The spectacular start to his career helped, with matchwinning performances like the one in Christchurch in 1991-92: 46.1-25-47-7 puts a lot of credit in the economy-rate bank. It also helped that he only played two Tests in the 2000s, when scoring rates went through the roof. Shane Warne, for example, had an economy rate of 2.39 in the 1990s and 2.95 in 2000s. And poor old Tuffers was marmalised by Australia in his last appearance. “It’s the first time in three days it’s been cool enough to leave my flat so I’m going out for a walk and DARING this thunderstorm to intervene and stop me. (I was quite, quite cross when I discovered the rain that swept across the rest of the country skirted London yesterday.) Please could you organise for there to be some cricket for me to listen to as I walk?”Who do you think I am, Donnie Darko? Play will resume at 4pm.There will be another inspection at 3.45pm BST, 3.45am SST (on Friday).“Afternoon, Rob,” says Digvijay Yadav. “Where do you stand on this Archer business? I think he’s done alright in his first year in Test cricket but England (or the fans) think if he’s going to bowl mid 80s and swing it around there are about five other blokes who can do the same, to say nothing of the fact that unless he channels his inner Frank Tyson, England won’t be able to regain those Ashes.”I think we’re a weird little country that can’t cope with being gifted a once-in-a-generation talent. Archer’s been an England player for 15 months. In that time he’s starred in a World Cup win, taken three Test five-fors, been involved in the most exhilarating head-to-head battle in an England match since Donald v Atherton, been involved in another with Matthew Wade, hooped the ball round corners like Sir Alec Bedser to skittle Australia, been overbowled and underbowled, been racially abused by people who will never know better and treated with a thundering lack of empathy by those who should. I’ve no idea how we got to this position, but it’s wearingly familiar and I’m pretty worried. If I was in charge I would send him off to the white-ball bubble a fortnight or so with Eoin Morgan would do him the world of good.“’noon, Rob,” says Ian Copestake. “So where do you ‘stand’ on the MBM contributor style guide regarding to ‘double-quote’ or not? Be warned though, hombre: “Don’t push too far your dreams are china in your handDon’t wish too hard, because they may come true.”Tim’s right. This is not infrequently the case, as he’s the finest editor I’ve ever met. In this case, we use double quotes for the email, so any quotes within that email should be single marks. Liveblogs are so frantic that consistent house style often takes a hit (diacritical marks, for eg), but it’s nice to do things properly when we can. There’s nothing worse than waking up at tree o’clock, in a cold sweat, and dashing upstairs to check whether you had the correct quotation marks on the latest Mac Millings XI.“A large thunderstorm has also curtailed my planned lunchtime gardening activities here,” says Kim Thonger, “so I’ve wasted the early afternoon compiling teams for a potential Disney v Pixar Test Match. Surprising how many characters have names that sound splendid in a scorecard situation. For example: Abraham DeLacey c Peter ‘Claws’ Ward b Finn McMissile 83. Disney XI Sheriff of Nottingham Judge Claude Frollo Sheriff WoodyThe umpires are chatting to the groundstaff. There are two problems: a) a wet outfield and b)The barest of margins I must say thanks to the kind folk at Allen \u0026amp Unwin who sent me a copy of Morgan’s Men by Nick Hoult and Steve James. Apparently England won the World Cup last year, which sounds like a great yarn, and this is the inside story of how it happened. I’m three chapters in and it’s terrific stuff.“Hi Rob,” says Graham. “Firstly, a shout out to Krakow Cricket Club in Poland is always welcome. We’re still going strong although this year our only visitors came from the Warsaw Hussars (the only Polish only cricket team!). Secondly, elephant in the room for this Test is surely the weather forecast. Can we get a result in the 6-7 sessions of play we’re likely to manage in Southampton in the next four days?”If we only get six or seven sessions it’ll be a draw. But the forecast I’m looking at isn’t that bad. (I’m not saying my forecast is better than your forecast, btw. Though it is from the Met Office, now you mention it.) Thanks Tim, afternoon everyone. It’s stopped raining in Southampton and there will be an inspection at 3.15pm.After my little plea about quote marks, Adrian Goldman responded by saying he would be “citing” me, complete with chevrons. “Now’s my chance,” he adds, gleefully. “Yes, someone: «In his last few Tests, he’s been thrifty, accurate but not penetrating, and after that bright start this performance seems to be heading the same way.»” As the players say, gotta hold my hand up. And that’s it from me, with Rob Smyth all set to take over. Thanks for your thoughts on everything from selection to hair loss – see you tomorrow.The Hampshire groundstaff sprang into action, but even so Ian Ward on Sky reckons we’re in for a 45-minute delay, which is frustrating for fans of Jimmy Anderson, Babar Azam and good contests.Mid-34th over: Pakistan 85-2 (Abid Ali 49, Babar Azam 7) Sam Curran comes back, bowls a few dots and then has to trot off, along with everyone else, as that lowering cloud empties itself. It’s now raining so hard that the screen has gone white.33rd over: Pakistan 85-2 (Abid Ali 49, Babar Azam 7) Another three to Babar as he clips Anderson gently through midwicket. 32nd over: Pakistan 82-2 (Abid Ali 49, Babar Azam 4) Babar isn’t going to hang around. He plays and misses at Broad, then repeats the stroke and picks up three to the cover fence, where Woakes pulls off a Mr Immaculate stop.“Morning Timmers!” said Hamish Kuzminski, a while ago. “Segueing from the last Test’s OBO conversations about cricket in Germany, I thought I’d send you a link to our local team’s website here in Friedrichsdorf, just North of Frankfurt. Jolly competent they are. Good looking bunch as well. It’s only available in Germish, but I think readers will get the gist all the same.“We had significant rain here overnight, the first proper precipitation in months, and given that the square this summer has been akin to distressed concrete, at the weekend I suspect the ball will be whizzing off the track like Barnes Wallis’s you-know-whats. No game today, only nets - so the likelihood of seeing some scary swinging is low. Auf wiedersehen, pal.”31st over: Pakistan 79-2 (Abid Ali 49, Babar Azam 1) So that’s the end of a fine partnership of 72, a classic ship-steadier. Pakistan could so easily be five down here. Those grey skies are getting even darker, alas.At last! An England slipper holds on to a catch, low to his right, and Azhar’s vigil is over. The ball was nice and full and fatally tempting. Did some idiot just start writing Anderson off again?30th over: Pakistan 78-1 (Abid Ali 49, Azhar Ali 20) England still haven’t got a gully or a third man to mop up Abid’s guides and nicks, and he cashes in again with a stroke that is somewhere between the two. Then, for a change, he picks up two with a shovel off the hip. 29th over: Pakistan 72-1 (Abid Ali 42, Azhar Ali 20) Just a single to Azhar off Anderson, who now has figures of 10-3-20-1. In his last few Tests, he’s been thrifty, accurate but not penetrating, and after a bright start this performance seems to be heading the same way. 28th over: Pakistan 71-1 (Abid Ali 42, Azhar Ali 19) Broad is on the spot, but Azhar knows exactly where his off bail is and pulls off an inch-perfect leave. The cameras find the next man in sitting on the Pakistan balcony: Babar Azam, who, if he gets going, will give England even more trouble than these two.27th over: Pakistan 71-1 (Abid Ali 42, Azhar Ali 19) Another guide from Abid, off Anderson – more of a nick this time, but angled down, with soft hands, and the result is the same, four. Joe Root may be beginning to regret leaving out both his truly fast bowlers.One or two readers were confused by the Bowtell list - sorry. I took him to mean that this was each bowler’s record in his first ten Tests. 26th over: Pakistan 67-1 (Abid Ali 38, Azhar Ali 19) Broad beats Abid with a lifter that held its line Abid retorts with an unruffled guide for four. And Nasser Hussain establishes that that appeal from Root was backed up by a little wiggle on Ultra Edge. Should he have had the courage of his convictions?25th over: Pakistan 62-1 (Abid Ali 33, Azhar Ali 19) Anderson beats Azhar’s outside edge and Root goes up, but it’s a lonely appeal and he doesn’t feel strongly enough to review.Tom Booth has been looking at Tom Bowtell’s stats for novice bowlers (13:02). “Broad’s figures for his first couple of years were indeed fairly poor with the ball (albeit compensated by good work with the bat). This was partly because he was under team orders to act as an ‘enforcer’, bowling too fast and too short to retain proper control. Not long after taking over, Flower publicly rescinded this and instead returned Broad to the line-and-length bowler he was always meant to be, with excellent results.” Good point. And this is your periodic reminder that it’s a big help to us if you can use single quotes, as everything you say may be taken down in evidence and put in double quotes. 24th over: Pakistan 62-1 (Abid Ali 33, Azhar Ali 19) Broad finishes his over under thick grey cloud and bright white lights. Broad is very full outside off, Abid Ali is leaving well alone and Jos Buttler is just about coping with a late wobble as the last ball dies on him. Tom van der Gucht has been thinking about Steve Finn. “I’ve never fully fathomed what happened to him. Was it a lack of form and injury, or something psychological that has tragically left long-standing scars? In The Edge, he was very candid about a period when his mental health deteriorated which I assumed was during the Ashes tour when Giles described him as ‘unselectable’. At the time, I had taken that to mean he had issues with his action, but now wondered whether it was the latest ECB euphemism for mental health issues - such as Trescothick having a virus - which I suspect are used in order to protect the privacy of the players rather than out of fears of any stigma involved with the term. But, either way, it’s sad to see and I still regularly check the Middlesex scorecards in the hope that he’s playing and has taken a bucketload of wickets.”It looks as if they’re going to resume at 1.35.“Hope you are melting nicely,” says Tom Bowtell. Ha. “With a low-level snarkinessvague disappointment creeping in about Archer in certain quarters, I thought I’d check his stats against his peers and the most recent England quicks to get 100+ Test wickets. Turns out he’s doing pretty well. As Broad and Flintoff (66.42!) show, it takes time to nail fast bowling in Tests. It also makes me yearn for what might have been if Finn hadn’t got injured or messed around.”Very interesting. Was Broad really that bad?Yes, that is luncheon. And the morning belongs to Pakistan, who batted first and walked the walk by watching the swinging ball, riding their luck, and taking umpteen singles into the leg side as England bowled a touch too straight. Jimmy Anderson made his point by grabbing an early wicket, and the new old firm of Broad and Woakes would have had one each if the opening batsmen in the slips had done their job. For now, the Alis have it. See you shortly.Mid-24th over: Pakistan 62-1 (Abid Ali 33, Azhar Ali 19) Broad is back to replace Woakes. He finds the edge of Abid Ali’s bat – with a nip-backer, oddly – but the ball drops short of slips. The nicks this morning have either gone very low or fairly high. And then the umps do wave the players off. 23rd over: Pakistan 62-1 (Abid Ali 33, Azhar Ali 19) Anderson puts the plug back in by returning to the eternal verities and aiming at Azhar’s off stump. When he goes wider, Azhar can’t find that cut again, hanging out a limp 45-degree bat that deserves to get a nick. Overall, though, he’s backed up his decision to bat with some sturdy defence. And he may get an early lunch as it’s now raining. 22nd over: Pakistan 62-1 (Abid Ali 33, Azhar Ali 19) Six off Woakes’s over as the batsmen continue to work the angles. By the time he gets to the sixth ball, Woakes is banging it in outside Abid’s off stump. He hasn’t been at his immaculate best, though that dropped catch would make anyone tear their Alice band out. “Regarding Abid Ali’s recent problems,” says Pete Salmon, “it’s been a long time since I bought a cricket box, but a quick google seems to suggest that even the best are the same £3 plastic ones as 20 years ago. Given the advances in not only cricket technology but every single bit of technology in the world, this seems odd given what is at stake. Do test cricketers have some sort of wurtzite boron nitrade thingy down there, or is it all plastic at even the highest levels?” That is a great question. I’m hoping one of our readers is better placed than me to answer it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f5e473633e02e07550433060cf91096b7059fac/0_111_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fce9b0c8e0e51082190bf3f94594e27","title":"tristram kenton chekhov in pictures","story":"In a new series, we open up  photographer Tristram Kenton’s archive of stage photos.

And I don’t think it’s too soon to think about what the community wants, and what the state wants in a leader.”If the Biden-Harris team wins on 3 November, California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, will appoint someone to replace Harris in the Senate for the duration of her term, which ends in 2022. Asked on Wednesday if people have already started pitching themselves for the position, Newsom joked with a reporter: “You may be the only one who hasn’t – unless you just did.” Later, he added that his comment was only a “slight” exaggeration.Everyone has their favorites, but Allison believes Newsom should not replace a woman with a man. “It’s just a bad look,” she said. “And after the protests inspired by George Floyd’s murder – to me it makes sense to have someone of color.”“Kamala Harris has a very important and significant voice and perspective in the Senate, just because of who she is,” said Nathan Barankin, Harris’s former chief of staff and a long time California political strategist. “That’ll certainly weigh on the governor in evaluating his options.”Here are a few of the top contenders.The 43-year-old Democrat has emerged as a progressive, populist voice despite representing California’s ultra-wealthy 17th district, where tech giants including Apple, Yahoo and Intel are headquartered. He served as national chair of Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign, and is co-leading California’s delegation to the Democratic national convention this month. Describing himself as “a pro-growth progressive”, Khanna is viewed as someone who can unite Sanders’ leftwing supporters and moderate Democrats.A progressive icon and memorably the sole Congress member to vote against authorization of use of force in the Iraq war, Lee has long advocated for police reform and criminal justice reform. The 74-year-old Oakland representative has also introduced legislation to create a racial healing commission amid the nationwide reckoning on racism and police violence. Serving in her 12th term in Congress, Lee is deeply established on Capitol Hill.Schiff’s profile rose this year due to his leading role in the Trump impeachment hearings. Schiff has lots of support in California, and he’s a top fundraiser. But as the head of the House intelligence committee, Schiff may wield more power if he stays in Congress rather than shifting to the Senate. That he is a 60-year-old white man also makes him an unlikely choice to replace Harris, who broke barriers as the only the second African American woman and the first south Asian American to serve in the Senate.The Los Angeles congresswoman emerged as a top contender in the veepstakes. In California, Bass has built a reputation as progressive and a pragmatist – a community organizer who fought police brutality and addiction in Los Angeles and a practical politician who helped dig the state out of a historic fiscal crisis in 2008. The chair of the Congressional Black Caucus is “someone who can heal our country – not just from the pandemic, but also from the racial isions, the economic isions”, the legendary labor organizer Dolores Huerta told the . Though her past comments on Fidel Castro raised concerns that she would alienate Cuban expats, 66-year-old Bass maintains strong support in her home state.His efforts to increase voter turnout across the state, and his strong rebukes of Trump’s baseless attacks on mail-in voting, have earned Padilla national acclaim. A longtime friend and political supporter of Newsom, if appointed, Padilla, 47, would make history as the first Latino to represent the state in the Senate. Unlike all the congressional members who might be considered for the role, Padilla has already won a statewide election.Becerra, who succeeded Harris as California attorney general, could also succeed her as senator. He has served 25 years in Congress as a representative from LA, and his national profile has grown as attorney general due to the state’s numerous lawsuits against the Trump administration, including its efforts to roll back environmental regulations, revoke the state’s ability to set its own car pollution standards, and rescind protections for undocumented immigrants. The son of immigrants from Mexico, Becerra, 62, would also make history as California’s first Latino senator. But as the state reckons with its racist policing system, his reluctance to shift investigations of police shootings to statewide agencies has come under criticism.She’s not well known outside California, but as the first Black legislator to chair the state’s budget and fiscal review committee, Mitchell gained popularity in her state and respect in Sacramento for negotiating two state budgets. Having held state-level office, Mitchell is now running for a seat on the LA county board of supervisors – but progressive political groups have also floated her as a contender for US senator. Whoever Newsom appoints as senator, Mitchell told the Los Angeles Times she’d like to see a woman succeed Harris, because women tend to elevate issues such as childcare, affordable housing and workers’ rights.Favored by progressives, Durazo made a lasting impact on Los Angeles politics as a labor leader, long before she was elected state senator in 2018. The 67-year-old is not well known nationally, or even within California – but her decades of activism on behalf of workers and immigrants, and her stint as the first woman to head the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor have earned her a strong base in LA and support from liberal political leaders statewide.This is far from a definitive list – political strategists have also floated California’s lieutenant governor, Eleni Kounalakis, US congresswoman Katie Porter and the California controller, Betty Yee, as qualified candidates for the Senate. “The biggest problem that the governor will have is the embarrassment of riches,” Barankin said. “To choose between all these qualified candidates is going to be very difficult.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e237f67bbe8a1dbf221c489fec98d0b215ff921/38_0_2480_1489/master/2480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=833e497e8533e50a032bcfe935089476","title":"cartier criticised for censoring gay couples in chinese ring ads","story":"Viewers sceptical of commercials with two men identified as ‘father and son’ A new Chinese commercial for a Cartier ring has drawn scepticism for portraying people who viewers believe were meant to be gay couples as family or friends.According to local media, Cartier also posted static adverts on its Tmall store page. Under an image of two women it said: “Mutual understanding beyond words. Witness our everlasting friendship.”A photograph of the two men said they were father and son. When it was pointed out the men were very close in age, different text was posted that said: “Father and son are like brothers.”One internet user said: “It’s weird to use a ring to explain the relationship between father and son.” They added that it appeared they were obviously meant to be a couple.“They look three years apart in age at most. Also, I’ve never heard of fathers and sons wearing matching rings,” said another on Weibo.Others decried China’s censorship, saying such actions “obliterate the value of all cultures”.“The campaign was much better when it stayed in the area of ambiguity. Now it makes me feel like being gay is something to be ashamed of,” said a Douban user after the static ads were posted.Homosexuality is not illegal in China, but it was officially listed as a mental disorder until 2001. LGBTQI rights still occupy a fraught space and discrimination is common. Since 2017 TV and online portrayals of what the censors consider to be “abnormal sexual behaviours”, including same-sex relationships, have been banned by the China Netcasting Services Association.Cartier’s Trinity ring was designed in 1924, with the three intertwined bands of different metals symbolising different aspects of a relationship.

A decision is expected on Friday. Auckland is nearing the end of an initital three-day level 3 lockdown in which people are advised to stay at home unless they need to travel for work, or they are shopping or exercising. All schools and childcare centres, and non-essential businesses have closed.Thirty-six cases are now active in the country, including those in managed quarantine facilities. One of the new cases announced on Thursday was at the Mount Albert grammar school in Auckland, and was confirmed to be a relative of someone in the initial outbreak. The infected student attended class on Monday, and local health authorities said they were contacting and isolating around 100 close contacts they had while at school.“As we all learnt from our first experience with Covid, once you identify a cluster, it grows before it slows. We should expect that to be the case here,” Ardern told a media briefing in Wellington. “We can see the seriousness of the situation we are in. It’s being dealt with in an urgent but calm and methodical way.”Dr Ashley Bloomfield, the director-general of health, said all active cases would now be required to enter government-managed quarantine, in a departure from a previous policy which had allowed infected people to self-isolate at home, or be admitted to hospital if they were severely ill.Bloomfield said despite people’s best intentions many were visited by friends and family when they fell ill, and placing infected people in mandatory quarantine was the country’s best bet at containing the spread. He admitted some Covid-19 patients had resisted the new measure.Bloomfield said isolation and testing of any close or casual contacts to positive cases was the primary response to the outbreak, as was tracing the original source, which remained elusive a day after New Zealand’s largest city entered level 3 lockdown.Genome sequencing was “well underway” on the original four cases, to trace the train of transmission, but Bloomfield confirmed the virus may have been circulating in Auckland for several weeks as the original case started displaying symptoms as early as 31 July.“We will find the source, I have no doubt about that.” Bloomfield said.One of the infected people worked in an Auckland cool store, and it was being explored whether the virus entered the country on imported freight, though Bloomfield stressed this scenario was “very unlikely”. The cool store had been swabbed to rule it out as a source of infection.New Zealand health officials say it’s only a matter of time before they solve the mystery outbreak. Outside of Auckland the rest of the country has had its alert level raised from 1 to 2.Experts agreed that until the original source of the virus is identified, Auckland’s lockdown would likely be extended past the midnight Friday deadline.A protest against lockdown measures was held in the Northland city of Whangarei on Thursday, but police said they encountered little resistance to the measures in Auckland itself.The contact tracing, isolation and testing process has been identified as crucial in New Zealand which, unlike other countries, has pursued an elimination strategy of the virus.It proved successful back in autumn when a 51-day lockdown eradicated the virus from the community and allowed Kiwis to return to their normal lives, aside from strict border controls.The new outbreak has returned New Zealanders to a lockdown tradition: waiting for Ardern’s daily 1pm press conference to learn the numbers of new cases.When the cabinet meets on Friday it must also consider whether to postpone a national election slated for 19 September.The finance minister, Grant Robertson, said the government would also look at further economic assistance for affected iniduals and businesses as needed.On Thursday morning, lines at testing facilities began before dawn, with waits expected to be up to six hours in some cases. Panic buying of basic food-stuffs continued, and supermarkets have now issued buying limits on some items.The police commissioner, Andrew Coster, said most Aucklanders were complying well with the lockdown rules, though some had tried to flee the city for holiday homes on the coast.AAP contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb146c723e820087cb3bb446570387049f6976b3/127_0_3746_2249/master/3746.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=675870898bceb9add74a8bdb4991a1a9","title":"italy pandemic plan was old and inadequate covid report finds","story":"Outdated guidelines and lack of protocols may have led to thousands of extra deathsA severely outdated pandemic plan could have contributed to thousands of Covid-19 deaths in Italy, according to a report set to be presented to prosecutors investigating alleged errors by Italian authorities.Italy had only “an old and inadequate plan” that “makes no mention of scenarios and planning assumptions”, according to the 65-page report compiled by the retired army general Pier Paolo Lunelli, and seen by the .Lunelli estimated that as many as 10,000 of Italy’s over 35,000 deaths may have been attributed to the lack of sufficient anti-pandemic protocols.Italian authorities allegedly failed to update the country’s pandemic plan in 2017, when the World Health Organization (WHO) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) established new guidelines.A “Flu pandemic plan” published on the Italian health ministry’s website shows it was last updated on 15 December 2016. However, the document’s properties on Abode Acrobat Reader show it was created in January 2006.“When you change a document, you should also change the title,” Lunelli, a specialist in NBC warfare and planning operations, told the . “It could be correct that Italy may not have updated its plan since 2006.”In his report, Lunelli compared Italy’s plan with those of other European countries.“We’re not the only ones with an old plan,” he said. “The difference was that we were the first European country to be hit by the virus, whereas others had time to plan.”The UK had an “exemplary” anti-pandemic plan and should have been able to contain the virus even better than Germany. The UK was considered to be one of the world’s leaders in pandemic planning, rated last year as second in the world after the US by the Global Health Security Index for its biological security strategy, published in 2018. But as with the US, it has been criticised for the gap between theory and action.Britain found itself at the back of the global queue for essential pandemic-fighting equipment, including masks and other protective equipment for health staff and carers and vital chemicals for tests. The House of Commons public accounts committee also expressed astonishment last month that there was no planning for the impact on the economy.“I have to say that the UK was in the best situation, but performed the worst,” Lunelli said.Italy was the first European country to be hit by the coronavirus pandemic in late February, when the country scrambled to quarantine 10 towns in the Lombardy region and one in Veneto after the first local transmission was confirmed.A national quarantine was enforced on 9 March as the death and infection toll climbed rapidly and hospitals became overwhelmed. The majority of Italy’s Covid-19 deaths have been in Lombardy, where an investigation driven by NOI Denunceremo, a group set up by relatives of the dead, is under way into possible criminal negligence by authorities.As a result of Lunelli’s report, the group, which has already submitted over 150 legal complaints to prosecutors, will also file a complaint against all of Italy’s prime ministers and health ministers since 2013 for failing to update the pandemic plan.Lunelli, who said he would be willing to face a prosecutor, wrote in his report that the lack of an effective plan had serious consequences on the number of victims and the economy.“Coping with a pandemic without good plans, with insufficient intensive care skills and a scarce stock of health protection devices, is like finding yourself driving a bus on a mountain road in the middle of a sudden and heavy snowfall without snow chains,” he wrote.“Unfortunately, the Italian bus ended up off the road with serious consequences in terms of direct and indirect victims as well as the economic downfall of some regions that mostly contribute to the national GDP.”On 13 May, the WHO published an independent narrative report, examining what happened at the beginning of the pandemic in Italy. The objective was to help other countries avoid the sort of disaster that occurred in Lombardy. It was called: “An unprecedented challenge Italy’s first response to Covid-19”.But the following day, the report was taken down from the WHO website and references to it were deleted, at the request, the  understands, of Dr Ranieri Guerra, WHO’s assistant director-general for strategic initiatives.The report, prepared by the Covid-19 Emergency Team at the WHO European Office for Investment for Health and Development in Venice, stated that Italy’s pandemic plan dated to 2006, in the aftermath of Sars, and was later “reconfirmed”.Dr Guerra has been the director general for preventive health at the Italian ministry of health and chief medical officer of Italy since 2014 – in charge of the office that was responsible for any updating.“Italy was not totally unprepared for an epidemic when the first news bulletins came from China,” said the deleted report. “In 2006, after the first severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) epidemic, the Italian ministry of health and regions approved a national pandemic influenza preparedness and response plan, reconfirmed in 2017, with guidelines for regional plans.”Guerra declined to speak to the  when contacted on Wednesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef8f83d26ad742b95296114f484dee37cf70a67f/0_273_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ba8a6287fa2bf1fbe1b8aea2a56e388","title":"operation empty plate xi jinping makes food waste his next target","story":"Restaurant diners told to order one dish fewer than number of people under new system criticised as overly controllingThe Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, has launched a campaign targeting a new enemy of the country: food waste.“Waste is shameful and thriftiness is honourable,” Xi said in a speech published on Tuesday, describing the amount of food that goes to waste in the country as “shocking and distressing”, according to the state news agency Xinhua.Quoting a poem, he said: “Who knows that of our meal in the dish, every grain comes after hard toil?” He added: “We should still maintain a sense of crisis about food security. The impact of this year’s Covid-19 pandemic has sounded the alarm.”The focus on food waste comes after weeks of mass flooding across the country wiped out crops, contributing to rising food prices – already higher after the Covid-19 outbreak paralysed the Chinese economy.Local authorities immediately sprang into action with proposals targeting the scourge of food waste, or “operation empty plate”, an initiative first mentioned in 2013 but elevated anew by Xi’s speech. The Wuhan Catering Industry Association called on restaurants in the city to issue a system called “N-1 ordering” whereby a group must order one dish fewer than the number of diners.Restaurants should offer half-size and smaller portions as well as offer to-go boxes to pack up leftovers. Following Wuhan’s lead, the cities of Xianning, also in Hubei province, and Xinyang, in Henan province, also proposed implementing the N-1 system.In Chongqing, the Federation of Industry and Commerce issued a statement promising to implement Xi’s guidance, setting up LED screens with prompts to “establish a frugal consumption reminder system”, as well as measures to “supervise consumers to eat frugally”.In a country where it is seen as polite to order more than the amount needed, “operation empty plate” will encounter difficulties. Meals are often served family-style with shared dishes and hosts tend to order more dishes than the number of diners in the group.In his speech, Xi called for strengthening legislation, supervision, and long-term measures as well as better public education to “resolutely stop food waste”. A report in 2015 by the China Academy Science and partners found that up to 18 million tonnes of food a year was wasted in large cities, enough to feed 30 to 50 million people a year.Under an article on Wuhan’s N-1 dining initiative by the official People’s Daily, internet users on Weibo left sceptical and in some cases angry comments. “Can you first limit the dining of officials?

The ports of Trieste and Genoa are said to be more practical for access and for managing passenger flow safely within coronavirus regulations.Other cruise companies that usually stop in Venice, including Royal Caribbean, are said to be on standby, with services more likely to resume in 2021.No Grandi Navi has organised a celebration on San Giorgio island on Friday evening. “We said it, we promised it, and this is how it will be: no ship will enter the lagoon for the entire season,” the group said in a statement.However, the planned celebration has been criticised in some quarters because around 5,000 jobs that are maintained by the cruise industry are at risk. Staff at the Venice cruise terminal have been furloughed since the outbreak of the pandemic.“We receive calls every day from people who haven’t worked since March,” Antonio Velleca, a spokesperson for Portabagagli, a luggage handler cooperative in Venice, told the Italian press. “Many have not received their furlough money and are anxious about the future.”Protesters argue that cruise ships have seriously damaged Venice’s fragile lagoon and pollute the environment. They have long called for the vessels to be banned from the city, and the protests grew more fervent in June last year after four people were injured when the 13-deck MSC Opera crashed into a wharf and tourist boat along the busy Giudecca canal. A few weeks later the 12-deck Costa Deliziosa narrowly missed colliding into a yacht during a storm. The Italian government pledged to reroute the vessels, but a plan is yet to materialise.“The loss of the cruise industry is an economic damage that Venice can’t afford,” said Pier Paolo Baretta, an under-secretary at the economy ministry. “But to maintain it, we need to find a solution as soon as possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa23d45e4813e3a585bdc005e1d70e7860eb19b3/330_437_4877_2926/master/4877.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7e42e4095cf6cf4b631ee37fc71c130","title":"beirut explosion devastates sursock palace and museum in pictures","story":"Among the many homes and buildings damaged by the Beirut explosion were the Sursock Palace and Museum.

Bavarian premier Markus Soeder has been forced to apologise over an embarrassing delay to thousands of coronavirus test results, just as Germany was seeing a new spike in virus cases.Some 44,000 people who took advantage of free coronavirus tests in the southern German state have had to wait more than a week for their results, Bavarian health minister Melanie Huml admitted on Wednesday.These included around 1,000 who tested positive, Huml said at Thursday’s press conference, adding that 900 of them had now been identified and were being informed after officials worked through the night to clear the backlog.Many of those tested were travellers returning to Bavaria and other parts of Germany after their holidays.“This is a difficult situation, no question,” Soeder told a press conference in Munich, calling the delays “annoying” and “regrettable”.“The entire state government is sorry that these mistakes were made... and that now many people are unsettled,” he said.Huml said the delay, which affected tests carried out at centres along the region’s motorways and in train stations, had been caused by problems with processing handwritten contact details.Soeder said his health minister had offered her resignation but he had not accepted it, calling the delay a failure “not of strategy, but of execution”.Green party politician Michael Kellner, however, said on Twitter that it was “the result of a policy that focuses on style instead of substance”.The World Health Organization downplayed the danger of the coronavirus latching on to food packaging and urged people not to be afraid of the virus entering the food chain.WHO head of emergencies programme Dr Mike Ryan told a briefing:People should not fear food, food packaging or delivery of food. There is no evidence the food chain is participating in transmission of this virus.The European commission said it had concluded preliminary talks with the US pharmaceutical company Johnson \u0026amp Johnson for an advance purchase deal of a potential Covid-19 vaccine the company is developing.The EU executive arm said this could pave the way for the signing of a contract that would allow EU countries to buy the vaccines or donate it to developing countries. The Canary Islands became Spain’s second region to all but ban smoking in the streets on Thursday as part of measures to stop a resurgence of coronavirus infections, and other regions considered a similar ban.Smoking will be banned when people cannot maintain a 2-metre distance between each other on the islands, which are popular with tourists.Authorities also imposed new restrictions including the use of masks in public at all times, a limit of 10 people in gatherings and restrictions on nightclub capacity.“The last few days point to an increase in positive cases ... We will increase checks to make sure people follow the rules because otherwise it will be our health and economy paying the price,” the president of the region, Ángel Victor Torres, said.The northwestern region of Galicia imposed a similar ban on smoking on Wednesday.Officials in both regions said smoking in public places, such as outdoor bar terraces or simply in the street with other pedestrians close, represents a high risk of infection.Since lifting one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns about seven weeks ago, Spain has struggled to keep a lid on new infections, with average daily cases rising from less than 150 in June to more than 1,500 in the first 12 days of August.There were 99 new cases reported in the Canaries and 107 in Galicia on Thursday, bringing Spain’s total new infections to 2,935 and the cumulative total for the country to 337,334. British prime minister Boris Johnson said his government was prepared to be ruthless with even its closest partners over Covid-19 quarantine rules, after he was asked whether France would be removed from the government’s safe-travel list.Britain has in recent weeks imposed a 14-day quarantine period for arrivals from countries like Spain and Belgium, responding to rising infections and fears of a second wave of the virus, having initially declared them safe for travel.Johnson told reporters on a visit to Northern Ireland:We’ve got to be absolutely ruthless about this, even with our closest and dearest friends and partners around the world.We will be looking at the data a bit later on this afternoon ... looking at exactly where France and other countries are getting to, and you know we can’t be remotely complacent about our own situation.The French health ministry reported 2,524 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday - the highest since its lockdown restrictions.That has prompted speculation it could be the next European country added to Britain’s list - a move that would affect the large number of British tourists travelling there during English school holidays.For UK holidaymakers, France is the second most-visited country behind first-choice destination Spain. Almost 13 million Britons travelled to France in 2017, data from Statista showed.Britain usually welcomes about 3.5 million visitors from France each year according to the same data, making France the second biggest market for tourists coming into the UK behind the United States. German airline Lufthansa said it had broken off negotiations with the Verdi union on cutting ground staff wages, warning that forced redundancies may be unavoidable as the pandemic wreaks havoc on the travel industry.Verdi union’s deputy chairwoman Christine Behle called Lufthansa’s walkout, after 20 rounds of talks, “a slap in the face” for 24,000 ground crew members.Europe’s largest airline by passengers said it was negotiating with all employee groups “to stabilise the company” amid the collapse in air traffic because of the coronavirus crisis.But without union backing for its proposals, forced redundancies “can no longer be avoided”, it warned.The flag carrier, which received a €9bn ($10.7bn) government bailout to stave off bankruptcy, announced in June that 22,000 jobs would have to go.Although it initially said it would use schemes for shorter work hours and other crisis arrangements to avoid redundancies, the company said at its earnings announcement earlier this month this was now “no longer realistically within reach for Germany”.In exchange, Lufthansa said it would offer “the exclusion of compulsory redundancies for the duration of the crisis measures.”But Behle said the proposed cuts were “not bearable”.“The income losses demanded by Lufthansa went so far that employees who had worked for the company for years would be pushed to the edge of the subsistence level,” she said.The union said it had offered €600m in contributions to cost cutting so far.Behle said the government should step in and “use its influence on the company to protect employment and maintain Germany’s air transport infrastructure.”Africa will continue to see new coronavirus cases as countries begin to reopen lockdown-devastated economies, but increases will not be exponential, the head of the African branch of the World Health Organization (WHO) said.Africa last week surpassed the figure of one million infections, with the continent’s most developed economy, South Africa, accounting for more than half of those cases.Seeking to strike a balance between saving lives and avoiding worse economic damage, many African governments are beginning to remove mobility restrictions imposed at the start of the pandemic and resuming business, including tourism.“We are very much expecting to see continuing increase in cases, a gradual increase... some upticks as these measures are being released,” WHO Africa regional director Matshidiso Moeti told journalists.But “we don’t expect to see actually an exponential increase. We hope very much this is not going to happen like we have seen in other parts of the world,” Moeti said.The briefing was held to mark six months since the first case was detected on the continent.Egypt was the first country on the continent to detect coronavirus, on 14 February. Since then Africa has registered 1,076,744 cases and 24,282 deaths according to an AFP tally.Countries that have started to experience rising numbers after easing of restrictions include Kenya, Algeria and Ghana, she said.And other countries that have seen rising new cases over the past two weeks include Nigeria, Madagascar, Zambia and Namibia.“We will have to contend with this increase... until such a time (as) we manage to have access to a vaccine and manage to deploy the vaccine. So this will continue until well into next year,” she said.Moeti arrived on Wednesday as part of 43-member team of WHO experts, who are being deployed to help South Africa respond to the pandemic.The key to fighting Covid-19 is stopping clusters spreading into community transmission, Dr Mike Ryan, head of the World Health Organization’s emergencies programme, said in today’s press conference.A very small percentage of the world population has had the virus already and it has a “long way to burn” if allowed, he said.The WHO does not have enough information to make a judgement on the expanded use of the new Russian vaccine, WHO senior adviser Bruce Aylward said at the briefing in Geneva.Russia on Tuesday became the world’s first country to grant regulatory approval for a Covid-19 vaccine, to be named Sputnik V in homage to the Soviet Union’s launch of the world’s first satellite.Spain reported a sharp rise in new coronavirus infections on Thursday as 2,935 cases were diagnosed in the past 24 hours, up from 1,690 reported the previous day.That brought the cumulative total to 337,334 cases. The ministry also said 70 people had died over the past seven days, with the cumulative death toll reaching 28,605.Brazil will require more information and talks before it commits to buying the Russian Covid-19 vaccine, which is at a very early stage, the country’s acting health minister has said.With the world’s second-worst coronavirus outbreak, Brazil has become a magnet for drugmakers seeking partners to test their potential vaccines - and then produce and buy the successful candidates.On Wednesday, a Brazilian technology institute said, shortly after the state of Parana signed a memorandum of understanding with Moscow, that it expects to produce the Russian vaccine by the second half of 2021.Speaking with lawmakers on Thursday, the health minister, Eduardo Pazeullo, said he took part in a video conference on Wednesday with representatives from national health regulator Anvisa, the Russian embassy in Brazil and the Parana government but said the Russian vaccine was still at an early stage.“It is just emerging,” he said. “We do not have depth in the answers, we are not able to monitor the data ... There will still be a lot of negotiation, a lot of work for this to be effective.”Nonetheless, he added that “we must also participate” if the Russian vaccine, which has faced skepticism from scientific experts due to a lack of test results, is shown to work.At the moment, he said, the most promising vaccine is being developed by Oxford University researchers in partnership with AstraZeneca.AstraZeneca has agreed to sell the federal government tens of millions of doses of its potential vaccine, and has arranged to transfer technology so Brazil can eventually produce it domestically at the Fiocruz institute, in Rio de Janeiro.Fiocruz has said production of the new vaccine will begin by mid-2021, but experts warn it may take at least twice as long. Some more words from Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus speaking at today’s WHO press conference.If we don’t get rid of the virus everywhere, we can’t rebuild economies anywhere.The sooner we stop the pandemic, the sooner we can ensure internationally interlinked sectors like travel, trade and tourism can truly recover.The director general of the World Health Organization has urged the world to work together as it moves forward in the Covid-19 pandemic, rather than focusing on “how to get back to normal”. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus talked in detail about how the world has come together since the outbreak of the disease to share resources and information on the virus to enable the rapid development of tests and vaccine candidates. However, he warned much greater financial investment will be needed to ensure multiple vaccine candidates are researched and therefore increase the likelihood of success. When a successful vaccine is found, there will be greater demand than there is supply. Excess demand and competition for demand is already creating vaccine nationalism, and risk of price gouging. This is the kind of market failure that only global solidarity, public sector investment and engagement can solve. He said the world needs to spend at least $100bn on new tools to address the coronavirus pandemic.He added that the IMF estimates the Covid-19 pandemic will cost the global economy $375bn a month, and predicts a cumulative loss over two years of over $12tn. New Zealand’s sharp response to a cluster of cases contrasts with the uncertainties surrounding the UK prime minister’s plans, writes David McCoy, a professor of global public health and director of the Centre for Public Health at Queen Mary, University of London.Unlike New Zealand, England’s approach is not to eliminate Covid-19 altogether, but to minimise its impact. Instead, there are good reasons to be worried about the approaching winter, when transmissibility of the virus will be greater and schools are expected to reopen. Crucially, the country’s over-centralised, fragmented and semi-privatised test-and-trace system has been costly and ineffective despite the proclamations of Boris Johnson, a system based on outsourcing centralised contracts to Serco, which then outsourced contact-tracing jobs to call centre operatives, was never going to be “world-beating”.Berlin’s legendary Berghain nightclub will relax its notoriously strict door policy for art lovers from next month as the venue turns into a gallery, while the German capital’s nightlife remains on hold because of the pandemic.Berghain, housed in an old power plant on the border between the Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg districts, will from 9 September show works produced during the Covid-19 lockdown by 85 Berlin-based artists, including established figures such as Olafur Eliasson, Tacita Dean and Wolfgang Tillmans and younger names such as Shirin Sabahi, Christine Sun Kim and Sandra Mujinga.Visitors will be able to book guided tours that will take them through the club’s 3,500-sq-metre premises, including the dancefloor, the Panorama bar and “dark rooms” designed for casual sexual encounters between clubbers.The entrance fee will go towards supporting Berghain, one of 140 nightclubs in Berlin facing an uncertain future because of the pandemic.Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta, has extended restrictions to stem surging coronavirus transmission, as the country reported 2,098 new cases.Indonesia has reported a total 132,816 coronavirus infections and 5,968 deaths. Jakarta logged 608 new cases on Thursday, bringing the total to 27,761, the most in Indonesia’s 34 provinces, according to central government data.The governor, Anies Baswedan, extended restrictions, with restaurants, places of worship and public transportation operating at limited capacity, to 27 August.“Through this extension, we, along with the police and the military, will focus on law enforcement, especially on the use of masks among the people,” Baswedan said.Iraq’s health ministry has reported 3,841 new Covid-19 cases over the past 24 hours, a record since the first infection was registered in February.The latest count raises total confirmed cases in Iraq to 164,277, including 5,641 deaths, according to the ministry.Covid-19 has brought Iraq’s fragile economy to its knees and overwhelmed hospitals already stretched by decades of conflict and a lack of investment.Iraq reopened to commercial flights in late July after four months of lockdown. Earlier that month it had lifted other restrictions and reopened malls and shops.But the number of confirmed virus cases had risen steadily until Thursday’s record tally.It makes Iraq one of the worst-hit countries in the Middle East, but still far behind neighbouring Iran, where total confirmed cases since February are more than 300,000."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/551f9ac151cf3f94db3f0226425cc52f2dac98ab/0_603_3002_1801/master/3002.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ecceb0d5e62774d2599bf2b76fd2233","title":"uk coronavirus live news covid 19 latest updates","story":"Outbreak affects nearly 300 people at Northampton factory app to be trialled on Isle of Wight and in Newham NHS England wait lists longest everA banana distribution centre in Coventry is working with public health officials to contain a coronavirus outbreak, Sky News reported.All staff at Fyffes Group Limited, at Cross Point Business Park, are to be tested as a precaution after 10 members of staff tested positive for the virus.The management at the company are working with public health officials at Coventry City Council, Public Health England Midlands and the Health and Safety Executive.The sandwich factory in the East Midlands where almost 300 people have tested positive for coronavirus (see 3.21pm) supplies Marks \u0026amp Spencer.Northampton, where the site which employs more than 2,000 people is located, had already been identified as potentially facing a local lockdown.One of those to test positive was the Bakers’ Union’s branch secretary for the factory, Nicolae Macari. He said he tested positive on 4 August, along with his mother and father – who also work at Greencore – and his wife. He told the BBC:When suddenly three or four people are pulled out of a line because they have tested positive, people are terrified.The company spokeswoman told the BBC Greencore had “highly effective measures in place and they continue to work extremely hard to exceed the requirements needed to be Covid-19 secure within the workplace”.She suggested the outbreak was “about how people behave outside of Greencore, not at work.” Production is said to be continuing as usual as the plant, with no apparent concerns about the products.The competition watchdog has been forced to abandon some of the remedies it was considering to mend the funeral sector because the coronavirus pandemic allegedly made them unsafe to implement.The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it would require funeral directors and crematoria to be more upfront with their pricing, but could not take some of the more radical measures that it had considered, such as price caps.Martin Coleman, who chaired the CMA’s inquiry panel, said: Given the inherently distressing circumstances in which people arrange a funeral, we want to make sure they can be confident that they are not being overcharged and that their loved one is cared for properly - this is what our investigation has focused on.The CMA said it struggled to obtain the right data from overstretched funeral directors and crematoria, and therefore could not forecast the impact of price controls on their businesses.It said the pandemic had created “insurmountable obstacles”, but planned to consider if it needed to carry out another investigation when conditions were more stable. The industry has been waiting 17 months to hear the CMA’s findings.Insurance company Royal London had been pushing for funeral help for low-income families, and for information on pricing to be available in hospitals and care homes. It said:It’s disappointing that the CMA’s investigation hasn’t resulted in the change we had hoped but it is encouraging to see that funeral directors will have to be more upfront with the pricing and services they offer.While there has been change in the market since it was put under scrutiny by the CMA, there is more work to be done, particularly for low-income families who fall into funeral poverty.”The CMA also said people in the UK were typically being overcharged by at least £400 – and possibly a lot more – when they paid for a funeral. However, it recognised this figure was “likely to underestimate the customer detriment per funeral significantly”.Boris Johnson has said the government will be “absolutely ruthless” in deciding whether to impose a requirement on people arriving in the UK from France to quarantine for 14 days.His statement comes after the  learned Netherlands and Malta were set to be removed from England’s travel corridor list but that ministers were still mulling over a decision on the UK’s nearest easterly neighbour.The prime minister told reporters during a visit to Northern Ireland that officials would be looking at the latest coronavirus figures later today.We have got to be absolutely ruthless about this, even with our closest and dearest friends and partners. I think everybody understands that.We will be looking at the data a bit later on this afternoon - looking exactly where France and other countries are getting to. We can’t be remotely complacent about our own situation. Everybody understands that in a pandemic you don’t allow our population to be reinfected or the disease to come back in.That is why the quarantine measures are very important and we have to apply them in very strict way.The Royal College of Surgeons of England’s president, Professor Neil Mortensen, has said the new data on record NHS waiting times (see 10.34am) showed that the responses to coronavirus have effectively caused a “wrecking ball” to strike targets. He added:In June most planned surgery was suspended while the country rallied to flatten the first peak of coronavirus, so these record waits are understandable. Nevertheless, each of these numbers represents another patient waiting in need, potentially in pain, for hospital treatment.Long waits have a knock-on effect on patients’ families, their jobs and the wider economy. It is a real crisis.The looming crisis facing cities in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic has been underlined by new data which shows that the number of people on London’s West End shopping streets is still only a third of normal levels.The figures came as the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, warned that the capital faced an “existential threat” from the pandemic.One in 10 Londoners are employed in the West End, and without a boost to consumer confidence, the capital’s premier shopping area is facing job losses of 50,000 and more than £5bn in annual sales, the NWEC warned.Footfall had been rising slowly in the West End since the reopening of non-essential shops on 15 June, but has now plateaued. Research carried out on behalf of NWEC reveals that the majority of UK consumers are anxious about going on public transport. The West End is also usually a prime destination for overseas tourists, but only a small fraction of the usual tourist numbers are in London this year.The Netherlands and Malta are set to be removed from England’s travel corridor list but ministers are still mulling over a decision on France, the  has learned.The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, met with ministers on Wednesday afternoon where it is understood it was decided the Netherlands and Malta would be taken off the list after a rise in Covid-19 cases in the countries, but that a decision on France was delayed.Ministers at the meeting are also understood to have agreed that the British overseas territory the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the island of Aruba, a Dutch constituent country in the Caribbean, should be listed for removal.The move to take the four locations off the list – which means arrivals from those places to England will have to quarantine for 14 days once the measures are imposed – was initially expected to be announced on Thursday. However, it is understood Boris Johnson intervened to pause plans on Wednesday evening, with more time now being given to analyse Covid cases in France to see whether it should be removed alongside the other four locations.An outbreak of Covid-19 has been confirmed at a sandwich factory in Northampton.The company took the decision to test workers as a result of a rise in cases in the town. A spokeswoman for Northamptonshire County Council said 79 people returned positive NHS tests and a further 213 tested positive through Greencore’s private testing.As a result of the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the Northampton area, we took the decision to start proactively testing all of the colleagues at our Northampton site.We can confirm that a number of colleagues have tested positive for the virus and are now self-isolating. We are liaising closely with PHE East Midlands, Northamptonshire County Council and Northampton Borough Council, who are fully supportive of the controls that we have on site.In each case we have immediately conducted contact tracing and instructed potentially affected colleagues to self-isolate. All of Greencore’s sites have wide-ranging social distancing measures, stringent hygiene procedures and regular temperature checking in place, and we are doing everything that we can to keep our people safe. As ever, the health and wellbeing of our colleagues is our number one priority.Lucy Wightman, director of public health at Northamptonshire County Council, said employees have been asked to “act now” after the number of confirmed cases in the town increased from 66 in the week ending 2 August to 85 for the week ending 9 August.We are working with colleagues at Greencore in Northampton after the discovery of an outbreak of Covid-19 in the workplace. Public Health England Midlands have been providing support to colleagues at Greencore in managing the outbreak.This has been supplemented by support from the local infection prevention and control team and Northampton Borough Council’s environmental health colleagues. It is evident that Greencore has highly effective measures in place and they continue to work extremely hard to exceed the requirements needed to be Covid-19 secure within the workplace.Northampton borough has been experiencing a high number of cases over the last four weeks and residents and employees have been asked to ‘act now’ to follow additional measures, to avoid a local lockdown or further government intervention.The Kings Fund, the healthcare thinktank, has warned that people could be faced with lengthy waits for years to come, following the news that the number of people waiting longer than 18 weeks for routine hospital treatment in England is at the highest level since records began.Gbemi Babalola, senior analyst at The King’s Fund, said: The sheer scale of pent-up demand for healthcare services and the ongoing challenges facing staff during the pandemic mean there is a long and difficult road ahead.Health and care leaders are already bracing for an intense winter spike in demand and patients should expect long waits for care to continue for many months and maybe years to come.Dr Lilith Whittles, a postdoctoral researcher in infectious disease epidemiology at Imperial College London, has warned there is not enough immunity within the UK population to prevent a second wave of coronavirus infections.At a Covid-19 webinar hosted by the Royal Society of Medicine on Thursday, she agreed that if local outbreaks were not managed correctly they could potentially lead to a second wave.Speaking on the results of the largest study on home coronavirus antibody testing, led by Imperial College London, Dr Whittles said: We’re nowhere near the level of population immunity that we would need to prevent the occurrence of a second wave. In a worst-case scenario of a second wave we could see a peak of a similar size to the first.Meanwhile, Ivan Browne, director of public health for Leicester, has suggested making test and trace more localised to help reach more people, as he described the centralised system as “ludicrous”.He added that the government needs to refocus its narrative regarding the easing restrictions, as he expressed his concerns over schemes such as Eat Out To Help Out.His comments came as the latest weekly NHS test and trace figures showed a drop in the 24-hour turnaround target for coronavirus “in-person” test results to just two-thirds, despite Boris Johnson pledging that all such tests would be back within that timeframe by the end of June.He added that one of the measures initiated in Leicester was iniduals who could not be contacted through test and trace within the first 48 hours being passed across to the local authority.Figures released on Wednesday show the infection rate in the city has gone up from 56.7 to 68.9 per 100,000, with 244 new cases.The way the central system was set up was it takes everyone as an inidual, which is ludicrous really.We’ve got to get a clear narrative of where we are, being in control and being cautious, and make sure we are not giving this virus the opportunity to pass on, because it will.A further 13 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals to 29,444, NHS England has said.The patients were aged between 49 and 90 and one patient, aged 86, had no known underlying health conditions. Another four deaths were reported with no positive Covid-19 test result.Plans for comprehensive health devolution across England should be developed within the next year in the face of worsening inequalities amid the coronavirus pandemic, a report has recommended.Democratically led local partnerships could help to create “healthy, resilient and prosperous communities”, the Health Devolution Commission said.The group, made up of five former health ministers across the Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat parties, said there was a “compelling ‘burning deck’ of circumstances that requires an urgent and radical response”.It said the pandemic had had a disproportionate impact on economically disadvantaged and black, Asian and minority ethnic communities, that people with health conditions like cancer and dementia had been badly affected, and that NHS and social care services were “deeply ided” while the demand for care was increasing.The firm’s cruise operations remain suspended until later in August.Manchester’s night time economy tsar Sacha Lord has warned members of the public are not being honest about how many people are in their households.Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, has said infection rates in Oldham are a “major cause for concern”.But he said he did not think the town should be subject to a tighter, Leicester-style lockdown “at the moment”.“We want to continue with the current restrictions, but with much more high profile work on the ground in Oldham,” said Burnham at his weekly press conference.Oldham has the highest infection rate in the UK at the moment, with 108.8 cases per 100,000 people as of four days ago.The deputy mayor, Sir Richard Leese, the leader of Manchester city council, said the “vast number” of positive cases across the region were either asymptomatic or with very mild symptoms. Hospital admissions had halved week on week and not many people were calling 111, he added.Infection rates were up in seven out of ten of the Greater Manchester boroughs, he said – with Wigan having the fewest cases and Salford and Trafford also on the decline.Asked if Wigan could be released early from the tightened restrictions, with positive cases “in single figures”, Burnham said he wouldn’t support that now, but suggested he may rethink his position next week if their numbers continue to fall.Wigan is testing fewer people than other boroughs, he warned, suggesting the numbers “aren’t fully comparable”.The number of job adverts has increased, including a big rise in vacancies for debt collectors, a study suggests.The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said adverts in the first week of August rose to the highest weekly total since the lockdown began.There were 1.1 million vacancies in the week starting August 3, up from 1.04m the previous week, although this remains well below the 1.35m before the first week of March, said the report.Last week also saw the highest number of new job postings since lockdown began, with almost 126,000 adverts between 3-9 August. REC said hiring “hotspots” included parts of Northern Ireland and London.Neil Carberry, chief executive of REC, said: The latest economic data tell a stark story of the scale of the lockdown recession, but now it is all about how quickly we recover. Many firms will face cash struggles in September and October, so redundancies will be with us for months to come and unemployment will rise, but a recovery is under way, as today’s tracker data shows.Construction sites have reopened, logistics companies are dealing with high demand, and with people spending more time at home, many have been looking to spruce up their house and gardens."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"\u0026lsquoExtensive Irish commitment to data centres\u0026rsquo could cause cost to consumer, study findsBuyers may want to go green, but for those travelling long distances the range is smallReform needed to safeguard \u0026euro6bn income while promoting electric vehicles, economist warns"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoring"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

A new £650 million Brexit support and peace and reconciliation package for Northern Ireland was announced by British Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove who was visiting the North on Friday.The funding comprises £300 million of support for the European Union’s Peace Plus programme and £355 million to assist traders in the North deal with the complications of Brexit. Of the £355 million the package involves £200 million towards a new free-to-use Trader Support Service that will assist with import, safety and security declarations on behalf of traders.The other £155 million, according to Mr Gove’s office, will fund the development of new technology to ensure the new processes can be fully digital and streamlined.Mr Gove’s department said the “new service will be available to businesses bringing in goods from Great Britain or the rest of the world, providing guidance as well as dealing with their requirements for moving goods into Northern Ireland”. The £300 million confirmed by Mr Gove for the Peace Plus programme will help “to support peace, prosperity and reconciliation projects on the island of Ireland”.Mr Gove who, accompanied by Northern Secretary Brandon Lewis, was visiting Northern Ireland on Friday, said the £650 million investment underlined the British government’s “absolute commitment to the people and businesses of Northern Ireland as we move towards the end of the transition period”.“Our new free-to-use Trader Support Service will provide vital support and guidance to traders, while our £300 million investment in reconciliation projects will help to preserve the huge gains from the peace process and the Belfast Agreement,” he said. “As we continue to engage with businesses, and our discussions with the EU proceed, we will update these resources to ensure that traders are ready for the end of the transition period,” added Mr Gove.Mr Lewis said the Trader Support Service “will ensure that businesses of all sizes can have import processes dealt with on their behalf, at no cost”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4329491.1597331850!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach says landing zone exists for trade deal between eu and uk","story":"Micheál Martin and Boris Johnson in their first meeting as Taoiseach and British prime minister in Hillsborough, Co Down, on Thursday concentrated developing the “warm relationship” between Britain and Ireland.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA Wire Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said a “landing zone” exists for the EU and UK to strike a trade deal before the end of the year.Speaking after his first meeting as Taoiseach with British prime minister Boris Johnson at Hillsborough, Co Down on Thursday, Mr Martin said both sides knew that they needed to avoid another economic shock following Covid-19.“I think where there’s a will, there’s a way,” he said.“It seems to me that there is a landing zone if that will is there on both sides and I think it is, on the European Union side and on the British side to find that landing zone.“My own gut instinct is we both understand that we don’t need another shock to the economic system that a no-deal Brexit would give or a sub-optimal trade agreement would give to our respective economies across Europe, Ireland and of course within Great Britain itself alongside the enormous shock that Covid has already given.”Mr Martin said he hoped for a “productive outcome” when Brexit negotiations resumed later this month.The Taoiseach also said it was important that the centenary events to mark the partition of Ireland were respectful and enlightening.“History for me is about enlightening the generations to come and current generations,” he said.“It’s not about trying to prove a point — there will be different perspectives in relation to obviously the centenary commemoration of 1920 and 1921 in respect of the island of Ireland, both in the Republic we will be doing our centenaries and likewise in the north.”He said he had told Mr Johnson that the model used to commemorate the various 1916 centenaries had proved successful.“He accepts readily that different traditions will have a different perspective on these big events,” he added.“The key point is that you tell history, you teach it, you present it in as broad a way as possible, warts and all, and you invite people to make their observations, to take their own insights from an objectively presented narrative.“That’s the key. No one party owns our history. No one political party does. No one tradition does. The challenge for us really is can we organise centenary commemorations in a way that is as inclusive as possible, as respectful as possible of the different traditions, but done in a way that brings new insights into what actually transpired 100 years ago?”‘Warm engagement’Earlier, after he was greeted by Mr Johnson at the door of Hillsborough Castle, Mr Martin said he and the prime minister would work “very warmly together”. “We look forward to a very warm engagement,” he said. “It is important for us both in terms of the British-Irish relationship, which has been the cornerstone of much progress on the island of Ireland, and between our two countries for well over two to three decades, and we want to maintain that.” Mr Martin said there were “challenging times ahead” with Covid, Brexit, and other issues. He referred to how this engagement was due to take place last week but had to be postponed due to the death of John Hume. The Taoiseach said it was particularly fitting that Mr Hume was remembered at times like this “because he did so much to facilitate these kind of meetings and make them much more regular in the normal course of events”. Mr Johnson endorsed Mr Martin’s comments about Mr Hume. He said he had the honour of meeting Mr Martin a number of years ago and looked forward to developing the relationship. “It’s great to see you Taoiseach, it’s great to be here in Northern Ireland and we look forward to developing our relationship in all sorts of ways, east-west, north-south , you name it,” said Mr Johnson. The Taoiseach and prime minister then went on a tour of the Hillsborough Castle Castle before having a working lunch. –Additional reporting PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph:  David HaskellAt a distance Charles Fort in Kinsale looms up from the landscape in shades of grey stone but once you get closer you can see that its surface is actually multicoloured. Lichens crust the walls, including the bright yellow Caloplaca decipiens and the deep black Varrucaria maura. The tops of the walls are home to flowering grasses, mosses and heathers. Rather than a dead artefact it is a living habitat.Of all the organisms now living among the 17th-century walls, the lichens have probably been there the longest. Lichens are an organism made up of fungus and algae and they can live for thousands of years, growing very slowly and regularly. Recognition of their age and their regular growth rate led to the science known as “lichenometry”, pioneered in the 1950s. It uses the growth rate of lichens to determine the age of the surface that they grow on.Movement of glaciersRoland Beschel, an Austrian scientist, first suggested the use of lichens for dating. He had noticed that larger lichens appeared on older glacial moraine (the rocks left behind when a glacier retreats) and proposed that a lichen growth pattern could be used to date the movement of glaciers in the Alps. Lichenometry continues to be an important way to study the retreat of glaciers, especially now in the context of climate changes observed at the poles. Other geological events can be dated using lichens including volcanic eruptions and landslides.Lichenometry has also been extended into the realm of archaeology where it can be useful when radio carbon dating is either not possible or not likely to prove especially helpful.The technique is not without difficulty. Lichen growth rates can be affected by weather changes and the same species will grow differently in different environments (despite the fact that a single species of lichen may be found across the globe). Lichens on a surface may merge with one another, making it difficult to determine the precise size of a single specimen. Fire destroys lichen thereby “resetting” the lichenometric clock. The technique further assumes that a lichen immediately colonised the rock in question, but this may not be true.GravestonesNonetheless, lichenometry can be helpful in dating particular kinds of sites and objects when other methods of dating prove difficult. Unmarked or degraded gravestones are one useful example. A study by Brandy Luthe et al in 2018 used lichen growth to date headstones in a cemetery in Arkansas that was associated with the advance of western settlement.No documentary evidence existed about the establishment of the cemetery and some headstones were not dated. Dated headstones could be used to establish a growth curve for the relevant lichens. Lichenometry (combined with other methods) suggested that the cemetery was founded about 1800, earlier than the dated headstones.The fact that lichens need sunlight to grow is also helpful in dating. For example, a rock that has lichens on a surface not exposed to the sun suggests that the rock has been recently moved. For archaeologists studying Native American sites lichenometry can help to establish how much the form of a wall, for example, has been altered by 21st century hikers or campers moving the stones out of place.In Ireland, lichens have been used by Eoin Halpin to make an argument about the shape of portal tombs. Halpin supports the idea that the tombs were not fully covered with cairn stones by the observation of a lichen “tide mark” on the large stones forming the portal. Lichens above the mark are different than those below, suggesting that the lower parts were originally covered with cairn stones. Lichens only began growing below the tide mark after the cairn stones were disturbed.Matilda KnowlesIrish botanist Matilda Knowles dedicated many years to the study of lichens, identifying new species and publishing a book on them in 1929. Her list of lichen species found in Ireland is a compilation of her own diligent work and that of many Irish naturalists over more than a century and a half.Lichens have born silent witness to thousands of years of Irish history, colonising new surfaces as they have become available from trees in the deer park of the Castlemartyr estate, to the sea wall in Sutton, to limestone walls at Tara, to the Fort Hotel in Greencastle, to mud walls on the Circular Road in Dublin and apple trees at Ardnacrusha.Dr Juliana Adelman lectures in history at Dublin City University"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Jacinda Ardern sounds warning as number of cases in locked-down Auckland rises to 17Hundreds of police had raided Apple Daily in move decried as assault on press freedom\u0026lsquoGoing hard, going early with lockdown is still the best response,\u0026rsquo Jacinda Ardern saysReturn to nationwide restrictions announced by PM Jacinda Ardern in surprise press conferenceReaders queue from 2am to buy pro-democracy tabloid after owner Jimmy Lai\u0026rsquos arrestFair Work Commission\u0026rsquos decision that man made \u0026lsquooffensive\u0026rsquo video overturned on appealMaria Ressa\u0026rsquos news organisation Rappler is a buffer against dictatorship in PhilippinesLai has been a prominent democracy activist and an ardent critic of BeijingAuthorities warn against complacency as other countries battle a resurgenceCrack in hull of Japanese-owned ship is spilling oil into country\u0026rsquos famed blue lagoonsAttitudes still shaped by legacy code of conduct that dictates women must be submissive and patientAircraft with 190 passengers and crew on board overshoots runway in heavy rain in CalicutAbe avoids reference to nuclear treaty during scaled-back ceremony due to coronavirus\u0026lsquoWhat frightened me the most was how we got used to the piles of dead bodies\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash survivorIndia\u0026rsquos supreme court handed site to Hindus last year in culmination of complex disputeChina says attempts by Washington to engage more closely with Taipei \u0026lsquodoomed to fail\u0026rsquoCountry\u0026rsquos move closer to China set to be confirmed after unusually subdued pollThree men stuck on tiny Pikelot Island after boat ran out of fuel spotted by military aircraftAustralian state to deploy military, impose hefty fines to enforce Covid-19 isolationNorth Korea subject to UN sanctions since 2006 over nuclear and ballistic missile programsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4329618.1597334665!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bavarian test lapse in 900 positive covid 19 cases","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBavaria’s health minister Melanie Huml: she admitted the political rush to introduce testing  had overloaded an improvised, manual system reliant on volunteers from the local Red Cross.  Photograph: Getty ImagesMore than 900 Germans who tested positive for Covid-19 after a holiday abroad have yet to be informed of their infection – up to two weeks on.On Thursday it emerged that of 85,000 people tested after crossing the border into Bavaria, more than half – 44,000 – have yet to be fully processed.Some 60 per cent are from Bavaria and about 40 per cent live in the rest of Germany, according to state health authorities.“We were trailblazers but mistakes happened, mistakes that are regrettable,” said Markus Söder, Bavarian premier and head of the ruling Christian Social Union (CSU). The testing setback is a major political embarrassment for the 53-year-old, who has worked hard to build his profile in the pandemic as a reliable crisis manager.Mr Söder pointed out that Bavaria, which borders Austria and the Czech Republic, was the first federal state to introduce Covid-19 tests for returning holidaymakers. It introduced voluntary tests on July 25th, while obligatory tests were introduced at the start of August for all returnees from 130 countries on a “risk list”.On Thursday Bavarian health minister Melanie Huml admitted the political rush to introduce testing – and an unexpectedly high uptake from travellers – had overloaded an improvised, manual system reliant on volunteers from the local Red Cross. Many volunteers, she said, had spent the last days working at Autobahn border crossings in 35-degree heat, wearing full protective gear.Ms Huml expressed thanks to volunteers for stepping in as a professional provider – and a digital test registration system – had not been available at short notice. She offered her resignation but this was refused by Mr Söder.Health authorities have described the Bavarian case as a serious lapse given many of the 900-plus people with positive tests may not have been isolating. A private operator has taken over Bavarian border testing this week. Early May The news comes as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases across Germany rose again by 1,445 to 219,964 within 24 hours, the highest increase since early May.Official health statistics show that the vast majority of new cases in the last month were contracted in Germany – 8,607 – followed by returnees from the Balkans, Poland and Spain.He said the country’s health system was coping, but that the virus could “quickly gain momentum”.“We’re seeing that through holiday returnees, parties and family gatherings, and other causes that we have smaller and larger outbreaks in almost every part of the country.”Despite concern about lapses in social distancing and other pandemic measures, a new survey shows Germans think consideration for others is on the rise. In February, a survey for the Bertelsmann Foundation suggested 41 per cent believed citizens did not care about others, down to only 19 per cent by early summer.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Netanyahu plan to annex part of occupied West Bank suspended as part of agreementCountry needs administration that can fight graft, says German ministerWith 200 dead, 6,000 injured and 300,000 destitute, the mood in Beirut is unbendingNames of victims read aloud at demonstration near site of explosion that killed at least 171Prime minister Hassan Diab says blast that killed at least 163 was result of endemic corruptionResignation of government could enable international donors to sideline corrupt administrationPolice fire tear gas near parliament as donors pledge \u0026lsquomajor resources\u0026rsquo after explosionPort officials globally have a tough time preventing the abandonment of ships or seafarersTwenty-five years after the Balkan conflict\u0026rsquos worst atrocity the Bosnian town remains idedDemonstrations stretch far beyond prime minister\u0026rsquos official residence in Jerusalem\u0026lsquoWe have no trust in our government . . .

Historic Peace Agreement between our two GREAT friends, Israel and the United Arab Emirates!”, US president Donald Trump said on Twitter. The UAE, a staunch US ally, has been increasing its intelligence and security co-operation with Israel in recent years as both share common goals in countering Iran’s influence in the region and fighting Islamic extremism. Under Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, Abu Dhabi’s crown prince and the UAE’s de facto leader, the Gulf state has pursued an increasingly assertive foreign policy across the Middle East that has barely disguised its burgeoning ties to Israel. The UAE move will be a significant victory for Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who regularly touts his success in improving Israel’s relations with Arab states that were once sworn enemies.As part of the deal, Israel has agreed to suspend annexing parts of the occupied West Bank.

The Democratic candidate for the White House wears the years with a heaviness that is not lost even on his enthusiasts. While he never rules out a second term, this self-avowed “bridge” to the next generation implies just the one. With its lack of travel and live events, this Covid-19 election campaign, The Campaign That Isn’t, has spared him. The grandest public office in the world will not.Kamala Harris is, then, in line to be as much co-president as vice-president of the US. In the senator for California, Biden has hired not just a running mate but an executive burden-sharer and – forgive the macabre note – a viable stand-in. Given Biden’s taste for foreign affairs, she might have space to impose herself on the domestic realm in particular. Her potential influence is vast.It is also ambiguous. Biden has chosen Harris, yes, but which one? Disaffected Republicans will hope for the tenacious prosecutor with the Third Way patter. “It’s not progressive to be soft on crime,” she said, running for district attorney of San Francisco in 2003. As California’s attorney-general, she confronted the parents of truant children more zealously than she did the state’s draconian justice system.Progressives, for their part, will expect the other Harris. This is the one who opposed the death penalty earlier than many in her party and votes well to the left in the Senate. She was the untiring scourge of Republican nominees and witnesses in that chamber.There is no disgrace in inconsistency: give me an opportunist over an ideologue. Whether he actually said it or not, John Maynard Keynes’s airy line, “When the facts change, I change my mind”, is too stifling. People’s views can evolve even where the facts do not.It is just that Harris is such a pronounced case. A 55-year-old political lifer – she has never worked in the private sector – should have some definition by now. “Enigma” is the euphemism for someone whose core beliefs are so up in the air. Were she bidding to be a ceremonial vice-president, a less maladroit Dan Quayle, we need not worry. If elected, however, she is going to matter. And therefore so do her views.Presidential campaignLooking back, it is odd that such a fancied candidate did not do better in her own presidential campaign. She was a major politician from a state with a larger economy than that of most G20 countries (and all the donors that implies). She was of mixed race in a party that draws much of its support from minorities. Her Senate performances suggested not just ruthlessness but guile.In the end, what she did not have was perceived authenticity. In fact, every candidate in the Democratic primaries who had made a late-career turn to the left, namely senators Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand, flopped. Voters preferred the real thing (Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren) or an unabashed moderate like the South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg. Policies mattered less than the conviction with which they were espoused.Biden ran some way to the left of his former self, but then he already commanded trust. Personal tragedy and almost 50 years in public life will do that. He had “earned” the right to stick a licked finger in the air and sense the wind’s direction.Of course, the national electorate is not the Democratic base. And had Biden named Warren or an untested mayor this week, President Donald Trump might be high-fiving campaign aides. The Biden-Harris pairing is far more daunting.Just not, in part thanks to that vagueness of hers, unbeatable. In a reptilian passage of Tony Blair’s chatty memoirs, the former UK prime minister explains how to go about negative campaigning. The classic error, he says, with the sureness of the thrice-elected, is the lurid, over-the-top attack. Swing voters learn to tune these out. What moves them is the lesser charge, expressed more in sorrow than in anger.UncertaintyTrump will never persuade Americans that Biden is a menace to the republic and “against God”. The criticism that might land is that he is too old and weak to run his presidency. Other forces will end up dominating. If one of them is a protean vice-president, a crime-hawk until she wasn’t, with changeable healthcare plans, the uncertainty is doubled. Caveat emptor.“Look, I like Joe,” a canny president might say. “But do you really know what you’re getting?” It would insinuate that Harris is an agent of the far left, but then blank canvases are there to be painted on. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"a levels 2020 algorithms winners losers","story":"This year\u0027s cohort of A-level students have been the first ever in England to open results letters with grades determined not by exams, but by an algorithm.With the coronavirus pandemic cancelling assessments, Ofqual, the authority that regulates qualifications, exams and tests in England, instead developed and deployed a statistical model to award students their grades.The process relied on schools sending on predicted grades to the regulator along with a ranking of students by performance, which were then standardised in light of past inidual achievement and the historic performance of the school. The result: just under 40 per cent of grades determined by teachers - termed formally by Ofqual as Centre Assessment Grades (CAGs) - have been downgraded by the model, with around 36 per cent downgraded by just one place and the rest dropping by two or more. Some students had exam results downgraded by three grades - 0.2 per cent of all entries.Read more: Almost 40 per cent of A-level results downgraded as Government under pressure to U-turnThese CAG downgrades has not been felt equally, however - poorer students in particular have been hardest hit, as was the case in Scotland earlier this month.Technical documents released by Ofqual shortly after results were first opened this morning show that, on average, a student from the lowest socio-economic groups saw their teacher\u0027s grades downgraded by 10.4 percentage points (pp).That compares to students of medium and high socio-economic groups, which saw downgrades of 9.5pp and 8.3pp respectively.Ahead of A-level results day Ofqual had claimed that, without lowering the predictions of teachers, grades this year would have risen by an average of 12 pp. To avoid that, the regulator stated it was aiming for a two pp rise in grade inflation instead.Indeed top marks are up this year - by 2.4pp, meaning the share of students receiving A*s or As is at its highest since at least 2001, at 27.6 per cent. But poorer students again have lost out when it comes to high grades  - Ofqual data also shows that though all socio-economic groups saw a rise in grades, those in higher groups saw an increase in the A* and As this year when compared to their share in 2019. Analysis of data from Ofqual has also found that the number of grades at A and above rose by 4.7 percentage points in private schools compared to last year - the highest of any type of institution.Sixth forms, further education and tertiary colleges saw the lowest shift of just 0.3 percentage points.Academies saw a rise of 1.7 points, while comprehensives and selective state schools all saw a rise of 2.0 and 1.2 respectively.Read more: A-Level results day - live updatesWhile grades rose from 2019 across the board, the rise was not evenly spread across the regions, with attainment highest in the south of the country.Students in the East Midlands and London saw a greater rise from the 2019 results in the proportion of entries achieving at least an A grade - up 3.4 percentage points in the East Midlands to 24.4 per cent, and up 2.9 percentage points in London to 29.8 per cent.The regions where most students achieved the top grades were the South East (30.7 per cent), London, (29.8 per cent) and the South West (28.6 per cent).The lowest attainment came in the Midlands, with 24.2 per cent of entries in the west and 24.4 per cent in the east achieving at least an A grade.Some heads have hit out at Ofqual\u0027s model for, they claim, penalising their bigger schools with systemic bias. We are deeply concerned that the adjustment process may have disadvantaged larger centres such as colleges and those with historically strong value added data, said David Hughes, the Chief Executive of the Association of Colleges.There seem to be inconsistencies across the board. While 39.1 per cent of Centre Assessment Grades were adjusted down by one or more grade overall, we are hearing from a number of colleges that over 50 per cent of their grades have been adjusted downwards.Colleges with large cohorts and very stable and predictable results over time are seeing their lowest grade profile ever, particularly at the higher grades, A to C. Because on average more disadvantaged students attend further education colleges this may have resulted in a systemic bias.It is for this reason that I have written to the Education Secretary and the Chief Regulator of Ofqual this morning to ask for an urgent technical review into the A Level results standardisation process. If colleges, and subsequently many disadvantaged students have been hit by an unfair or inconsistent process then this needs to be investigated immediately – and adjustments made quickly.This should not be left to inidual colleges or students having to use the appeals process.”In a letter released to universities across the country ahead of results day, Sally Collier, chief regulator at Ofqual, said relying on CAG results would have created unfairness between different schools and colleges. Data provided by Ofqual reveals the CAG system would have given some grades an uplift of more than 12pp on the previous year.A grades would have risen by 12.5pp and B grades by 13.8pp without the introduction of the algorithm.We tested our approach to standardising students’ grades extensively to ensure it would not advantage or disadvantage particular groups of students over others, said Ms Collier. We are reassured that our preliminary analysis of the data shows no widening of the attainment gap between students according to their backgrounds.She added she hoped universities would be flexible toward students who had missed out on a conditional offer due to downgrading.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ben jerrys wokeness irritating savvy firm right stand ground","story":"In a world where tea brands are voices of reason and TV stars are presidents, why shouldn’t ice-cream makers chip in on immigration policy? That’s what happened this week, with Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s and Priti Patel engaging in a war of words over migrants in dinghies crossing the English Channel.As is customary when a company raises its head above the parapet, Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s soon found itself at the centre of a “Twitterstorm,”. The company’s mistreatment of migrant workers being one major bone of contention.Normally what happens when a company comes under fire is capitulation. The firm will rush out a statement about owning up to its mistakes, ignorance, and about how it will use this opportunity to listen and learn from those it has wronged. It will usually also allude to some form of structural prejudice at its core (sexism, racism, a dislike of the lactose intolerant) which it needs to address. It may, too, say it has sacked an employee or two, who it has deemed responsible (and expendable).Does anyone think Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s is about to do any such thing? Of course not.Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s is a junk food company that has decided to take on the British government just as Westminster contemplates restrictive bans on junk food advertising, not to mention a sugar tax. Moreover, it has decided to do so at the exact moment a heat wave has engulfed the country. It wants as much publicity at this point as it can get. But though Twitterstorms are largely seen as bad things, it has worked out this need not be.The phenomenon known as the Majority Illusion, where the amplifying of certain, well-connected voices on social media gives the impression of a view being more popular than it really is, is what allows many of these Twitterstorms to blow. Plenty of companies have folded on a position as a result, over the fear that a woke horde is descending across the digital steppe, when in fact just a few high-profile activists can create a whirlwind from waft. It also works in reverse — even if a majority of people are outraged over something, all it takes is for a similarly connected network to praise something (like, say, an ice cream company criticising a wicked, anti-migrant government) to amplify its message as the mainstream view.It’s not just through social media. Despite the majority of the nation being opposed to illegal immigration, that is not entirely true of those who control the channels through which news filters to the masses. For standing its ground, Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s will continue to garner favourable coverage on this issue, rather than negative, for as long as it chooses to be vocal.What are those who disagree with that stance to do? Declare they’ll never buy the product again? We all know it would be a lie few of the people now haranguing Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s seemed to have a moral issue over its exploitation of migrant labour. A tedious double insult ordinary people, who just want their borders properly policed and to be able to eat ice-cream in peace, could frankly do without. From a PR perspective, Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s is right to stand its ground. It has more to gain from doing so than abandoning their position. What grates is that so many other companies that should stand theirs fail to, for fear of the online mob. How many people have been sacked, and how many firms have gone grovelling to a few outraged keyboard warriors, because of perceived injustice, hypocrisy or prejudice that didn’t really exist? We can all think of plenty of examples. Every time it happens, the majority feels a little more disheartened. It feels as though our prevailing view is less prevalent than we had thought, and we wonder what hope is left, as one by one, companies “go woke” to avoid going broke. It may sound counter-intuitive, but more need to do what Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s have done, and stand their ground when the shadowy monsters come for them. The idea of monsters can terrify us into doing things we don’t want to, but we shouldn’t be scared of shadows. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"climate change rather overhunting may have caused woolly rhinos","story":"Climate change rather than overhunting may have caused the woolly rhinoceros to become extinct around 14,000 years ago, scientists have said.The findings, published in the journal Current Biology, showed the megaherbivores\u0027 populations remained stable and erse for more than 13,000 years following the arrival of humans.Senior study author Love Dalen, a professor of evolutionary genetics at the Centre for Palaeogenetics, a joint venture between Stockholm University and the Swedish Museum of Natural History, said: It was initially thought that humans appeared in north-eastern Siberia 14,000 or 15,000 years ago, around when the woolly rhinoceros went extinct.But recently there have been several discoveries of much older human occupation sites, the most famous of which is around 30,000 years old.The researchers said this stability lasted until well after humans began living in Siberia, contrasting the declines that would be expected if the woolly rhinos went extinct due to hunting.Based on their findings, the scientists believe this species, which was particularly suited to the frigid north-east Siberian climate, may have declined due to the warming period towards the end of the last ice age.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dithering britain denial eu turkey geopolitical time bomb","story":"President Macron’s lightning visit to Lebanon after the Beirut explosion highlighted France’s increasingly active interventions around the Mediterranean. Yet few policymakers here seem to have taken on board the risk of a geopolitical explosion at sea between France and Turkey.The two estranged NATO allies are jousting for influence and energy resources from Libya to Cyprus. France is sending out warships and fighters as the war of words between President Macron and his Turkish bête noire, Recep Erdogan, intensifies.France is backing Greece and Cyprus with a show of force as Turkish warships escort a Turkish drilling ship into waters claimed by the two EU states. That Turkish exploration vessel is named in honour of the great Ottoman pirate and slaver, Oruc Reis, whose rampages ranged as far as the French coast from his Algerian base. The symbolism of its name is obvious. High summer ought to be holiday season around the Mediterranean but the buzzing of fighter jets increasingly disturbing.Our Foreign Office provides travel advisories for danger zones, but its advice about Greek islands in the frontline in sight of the Turkish coast is about the marginal risk of Covid-19 not war. If Whitehall had given travel advice in August 1914, it probably wouldn’t have noticed the unusually busy trains on German railways heading towards Belgium. Post-Brexit Britain has its own problems with France over cross-Channel illegal migration, but President Macron is showing how an independent foreign policy might look.Don’t let President Macron’s rhetoric about defending the European Union’s borders and sovereignty mislead you. The reality is that Greece and Cyprus are looking to France as a great power ally. The rest of the EU maybe good for a statement of support and even a threat of sanctions but when it comes to possible use of force only France counts. Paris has military power. Brussels has words. Britain still has two sovereign bases on Cyprus which is in the eye of the storm. Turkish troops still occupy the northern half of the island. Ankara remembers  the crisis of 1974 when Turkey intervened in Cyprus. Britain remained passive despite being a guarantor of Cyprus and its constitution.That was at the low point of our post-war decline. Yet today, Harold Wilson rather than Margaret Thatcher, let alone Winston Churchill, seems to be the guiding spirit of British policy towards the gathering storm in the Eastern Mediterranean. British expats and tourists in Cyprus might continue to enjoy a quiet life if the tensions lift, but there is little sign that London is alert to the risks to them and our military there.Nonchalance in a crisis can be an impressive pose, but the lassitude gripping British foreign policy this mid-summer is a symptom of a deeper confusion in Whitehall about what this country’s role should be around the world post-Brexit. It is not a conscious retreat to a “Little England” outlook. That would be a policy. Instead passivity seems a substitute for knowing what Britain wants and how it can achieve that.

An unsanitary, untamed place with humans and wildlife packed in close quarters. The venue where a mystery virus can jump into the global population, creating devastating pandemics. The image of wet markets as disgusting and lawless – though a misperception – has already stuck. Calls have increased from around the world for China to shutter them to prevent a future outbreak. Such demands came after the coronavirus emerged at a seafood market in Wuhan, leading researchers to believe that a bug found in animals had mutated and jumped over to humans there.“I don’t think it’s necessary to close them – it’s a staple in daily life. But the sanitation regulations overall could be improved,” said Mrs Huang, 50, who has shopped at wet markets her whole life. Similar to what many in the West know as farmer’s markets, wet markets are typically rows of open-air stalls selling fresh meat, seafood, fruits and vegetables. They’re the place where many Chinese people visit to stock up on groceries. Some do sell and slaughter live animals, providing a fresh cut for the table. But exotic wildlife, like bats or civet cats, aren’t exactly common fare. Hu Tian, 30, is a fishmonger who peddled crabs and fish at the now-closed Wuhan market. He used to earn a living there to support his family of four. “I’ve sold goods in the market for more than 10 years, and I’ve never seen any bats,” he said. He now scrapes by via government subsidies.That’s not to say such animals aren’t being bred and traded. The Chinese government has pushed traditional remedies as part of a broader soft power campaign. Many of those herbal medicines use animal ingredients, such as bear bile, rhino horn and tiger bone. The rarer the remedy, the higher the price it sells for, an incentive for breeders to get in the game. Some looking to cut corners might engage in poor hygiene practices potentially dangerous to public health. As with many industries, regulating effectively is a challenge, even in an authoritarian state.Such nuance and distinction around China’s animal trade and its potential link to the Covid-19 pandemic has been completely lost as the world descended into emergency mode. A ergence in understanding about wet markets reflects a broader geopolitical ide that has occurred alongside the pandemic, with China and Western nations in many ways talking past each other. “Fracturing is a good word to describe where things are,” said Nadege Rolland, a senior fellow at the National Bureau of Asian Research. “I would argue that it started a while ago, and the fracture was already visible, but not as deep and probably, there was still hope that ‘we can do things together.’”“The last few months seem to have proven us otherwise,” she said. “This pandemic has accelerated this trend it served as a catalyst.” This puts the world in a dangerous place. Less engagement overall “is going to make the quality of understanding the other side much worse, and that’s going to lead to many more miscalculations,” said Martin Chorzempa, a research fellow who specialises in China at the Peterson Institute of International Economics. China’s handling of the pandemic – a heavy-handed response that included surveillance and suppression – made it clear to the world that the ruling Communist Party governed its country in a very different way to the West. On paper that had always been the case. But for many nations the coronavirus has highlighted the perils of dealing with an ever-powerful China driven by its own political motivations. It has prompted a rethink on engagement with Beijing, widening geopolitical fissures that were already in place. For years China seemed to accept that it had to play by rules set by the West in order to continue its rise. Now Beijing has indicated it wants to play by its own rules, and even have a say in setting them – brandishing its true colours in a way that can’t be ignored.Whether Beijing is successful in carving its own path – perhaps allowing other like-minded nations to follow suit – will shape global dynamics for years, perhaps decades, to come. As China grows ever more bold, the question is: Does Beijing even care what the West thinks any more?Before the pandemic, China was already at loggerheads with the US over trade. In Washington, there was talk of “decoupling” – essentially installing a firewall between the two countries as a way to protect America from the potential risk that came with the rise of China. Academics wondered whether the world was entering a “new Cold War.” None of this stopped Mrs Huang, part of China’s growing middle class, from saving funds to send her son, 20, to university in America to expose him to more ways of thinking. “In China, we look at issues from a single point of view, while in foreign countries, there are multiple perspectives taught,” she said. “To be a more open-minded person, you can’t just look at things your way.”Beijing was also embroiled in various diplomatic rows with countries including Australia, Canada and Sweden. In efforts to squeeze those nations, China acted boldly. Beijing arbitrarily detained two Canadians as retaliation after Ottawa arrested a Chinese tech executive during a layover in response to a US extradition request. There were mounting questions about the security threat of having Chinese companies involved in building key infrastructure, such as 5G mobile networks, or Chinese tech suppliers selling surveillance cameras and drones to national police forces. What would happen if the Chinese state compelled companies to give up data – a power inscribed in law? Then, pro-democracy protests roiling Hong Kong for months last year captured the world’s attention. Screens filled with images of riot police firing tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators fighting against Beijing’s encroaching control. The youngest person arrested was 11. Calls from the UK and US grew, urging China to employ a lighter touch. Beijing, tired of being scolded by the West, appeared to get more aggressive, not less. This was the backdrop against which the world entered the pandemic. In retrospect, it marked the beginning of a grinding decline that risks permanently souring China’s relations with the West.China has long had global impact, climbing quickly to become the world’s second-largest economy, powered by low-cost manufacturing and exports. At home, the Chinese watched their country transform from rice paddies and industrial wasteland into megacities – Shanghai and Beijing both have more than 20 million people. Mrs Huang, who declined to give her real name, talked of old Beijing, before small lanes disappeared into highways. The Costa Coffee branch we met in was located in a shiny mall towering over what used to be a patch of overgrown dirt. Like others in her generation, she lived through the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 when the Chinese military opened fire on peaceful pro-democracy student demonstrators – an incident the government still refuses to acknowledge. The bet the ruling Communist Party made was that the country of 1.4 billion people would accept less social and political freedoms in exchange for continued economic growth and upward mobility. At least so far, that gamble has proven right.“Our lives really did improve for the better,” said Mrs Huang. “There are two reasons we tolerate the way things are here – one, the standard of living is always advancing and second, from a young age, we were taught that things could only be this way.” Outside of China, many people likely felt it first in their wallets, enjoying lower retail prices as the country became the world’s factory of choice – cheap labour, fast production. Then, over the last decade, students from China began to fill more and more spots in universities around the world. Chinese investors snapped up prime assets – the Cheesegrater in London, the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York, Italian football club Inter Milan. Chinese shoppers, splashing their newfound wealth, boosted sales for luxury brands, like Louis Vuitton and Prada. But much of this was in the periphery, and didn’t touch the global population in a tangible way. That didn’t come until the coronavirus pandemic, when suddenly people encountered China in their living rooms.“It’s Covid that really stirred people up,” said Charles Parton, a former British diplomat who spent more than two decades working on greater China. The pandemic “brought the Chinese Communist Party into focus in people’s minds.”China’s cover-up and lack of transparency exacerbated the initial outbreak in Wuhan with unprecedented consequences. For weeks, Chinese authorities seeded complacency, telling the world there was no reason to worry. At the same time, whistleblowers – including doctors who noticed patients with strange illnesses – were detained, fined and reprimanded by police. Delays in reporting information occurred between the local and central government, and later, between Beijing and the world. Cases were discovered in other countries – Thailand, South Korea, Japan – for a full week before Chinese authorities admitted that human-to-human transmission was possible. Three days after announcing as such, the government locked down 11 million people in Wuhan. Hospitals didn’t have enough patient beds. Staff were so overwhelmed with coronavirus cases that pregnant women and cancer patients – even if they managed to obtain permission to travel during lockdowns – couldn’t get medical care.Evidence surfaced uncovering what appeared to be a far greater death rate than authorities had revealed. Pictures of corpses piled high circulated online briefly, before being deleted by government censors. But Beijing continued reassuring that all was under control. Early missteps were a direct consequence of how things run under the ruling Chinese Communist Party. And for the first time, repercussions due to the inner workings of the Party hit the world in a deeply personal way. The Party values stability above all, a characteristic leaders believe will allow them to stay in power, and avoid being dismantled, like the Soviet Union. What that translates to on the ground is an impulse to give the impression that everything is normal. Suppression of information is common – anyone challenging authority is squashed, and lower level cadres, whose promotions are linked to hitting at times impossible targets, are hesitant to report unsavory information up the chain.Chinese authorities would never allow anything to sully its image in the eyes of its people – fed a steady propaganda diet about how the Party, at the core of life, knows best. An educated class in China, like Mrs Huang – who works for a startup tech firm – is aware the authorities made mistakes, despite the government’s efforts to rewrite the narrative. She thinks they should be held accountable, but acknowledges there are no avenues to do so. What worries her more is that international backlash against the Party’s errors will spill over onto regular people like herself, and her son. “I really do think there were issues at the start of the pandemic, but the government is separate from the people,” said Mrs Huang. “I don’t know if regular Americans can avoid conflating the two.”Even in Wuhan, ground zero of the pandemic, people doubt the government’s version of events. “Ordinary people like us will never know the truth,” Long Menglei, 30, told me in April as lockdowns began lifting in the city. Her mother-in-law was severely ill with the virus for weeks. But it’s much easier to keep your head down, as government suppression never lets up.When infections began to fall and China crowed of containment success to the world, police continued to punish thousands of people for sharing information about the coronavirus online. Those trying to file lawsuits and seek reparations for deceased relatives have been harassed and intimidated by police, causing most to drop proceedings. Government control has extended into the afterlife, as grieving families haven’t been allowed to visit cemeteries.They may never be allowed to freely pay respects authorities still don’t allow families to remember those who died in the Tiananmen massacre, and from natural disasters, like the 2008 Sichuan earthquake – the ruling Party is always wary of groups gathering and griping about the government. It’s all so sensitive that a phalanx of police, minders and officials surrounded myself and a colleague when we visited a Wuhan cemetery to investigate, detaining and physically assaulting us, and harassing our driver. So it’s no surprise many feel resigned to whatever the government says is the truth. “I think we should believe the government,” said Mr Zhang, 40, a tech worker in Wuhan who was enjoying sunshine for the first time after 70 days indoors when we met. “There is no other possibility.” As the first country to discover infections, China was also the first to see cases subside.Authorities gloated about turning the corner and publicised a far-fetched origin story – that the US military had brought the coronavirus to China. Beijing was trying to deflect blame over its mishandling of the outbreak by redirecting public discontent toward stories of the country emerging victorious in what leader Xi Jinping called the “people’s war” against the coronavirus. Peddling this nationalist sentiment was an easy sell while the rest of the world remained in chaos. The government spied a chance to use global disruption to its advantage. “It is possible to turn the crisis into an opportunity – to increase the trust and the dependence on all countries around the world of ‘Made in China,’” said Han Jian, a director at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a government think tank, in March. To that end, China began exporting medical materials and bragging about helping the world. Chinese state media conflated purchases of supplies by foreign nations with donated aid. “This boasting propaganda, which was of course aimed at the Chinese people although it’s conducted externally, enables them to say to the Chinese people, ‘Look at what we’re doing in the world China is leading the fight,’” said Mr Parton, now senior associate fellow at RUSI, a think tank.“This was, frankly, resented,” he said. “The Party is legitimising itself with its people, but at the same time, it mightily upsets the foreigners.” Some of the equipment that arrived was defective – inaccurate testing kits were sent to Spain, ventilators that couldn’t be sanitised properly were sold to the UK, and masks exported to the Netherlands didn’t meet required standards.Nations felt slighted, especially as many had sent supplies to China earlier in the year. Plus, global shortages existed partly because Beijing had hoarded equipment, instructing employees of state-owned enterprises to bulk-buy face masks and mail them home. There was little to be done – before the pandemic, China provided 40 per cent of the world’s imports of face shields, protective garments, gloves and goggles, according to PIIE. After ramping up production, China was making more than 100 million masks a day, 12 times more than prior to the outbreak. Countries that needed medical gear had no choice but to import from China.China had always trusted that such trade reliance meant countries would tread lightly but the pandemic highlighted the dangers of nations outsourcing key manufacturing to a country they couldn’t quite trust. This prompted deeper thinking on longstanding security concerns about Chinese involvement onshore in other areas.Halfway through 2020, the geopolitical ide is more evident than ever.The US and China are barreling down a rocky path. Relations have hit a new low after clashes over trade, technology, coronavirus, human rights concerns, Beijing’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, and its recent imposition of a draconian national security law in Hong Kong. The UK has reversed its decision on allowing Chinese telecoms firm Huawei a role in building the nation’s 5G networks over security concerns. London’s offer to allow three million Hong Kong people a pathway to British citizenship has further angered Beijing. Beijing is “very surprised by the outcome,” said Kitty Smyth, founder of Jingpinou, a UK consultancy specialising in China. “They’re genuinely shocked that Britain would choose to remain with a struggling America, rather than go forward with a rising China.” Even Switzerland – known for neutrality in its foreign policy – has asserted its stance. In early August, Swiss foreign minister Ignazio Cassis said that China’s “human rights violations are on the increase.”“We are seeing China stray from the path of openness,” he said. “This means that Switzerland, too, must defend its interests and values more robustly.”The Chinese “haven’t experienced pressure this intense from foreign governments for several years, if not decades,” said Ms Smyth. But China has steadily increased its swagger to defy the West, ramping up territorial disputes on land and at sea this year. In June, skirmishes broke out along the high-altitude border to India, leading to casualties. Chinese maritime activity has increased in the disputed South and East China Seas, where Beijing and many Southeast Asian countries lay claim to the resource-rich waters. China has also buzzed fighter jets over Taiwan, a democratically-governed island with its own military, currency, passport and foreign policy that Beijing considers a renegade province. Beijing has encouraged Chinese in Australia to return home, or at the very least remain vigilant, citing a rise in racism. The government has warned its people away from the US over discrimination. That swagger has also been deployed at home, with authorities crowing that invasive contact tracing tools contributed to containment success – justification for more draconian surveillance in what is already the world’s most intense digital police state.Facial recognition thermal checks and apps that track people’s movements are now the norm. Those under home quarantine have had cameras and sensors placed at their doors to ensure compliance. “This will absolutely continue,” said Mrs Huang. Surveillance and contact tracing apps “have been so successful, why would they stop using them?“I can’t do anything about it, and you can’t refuse to use them,” she said. “There’s no such thing as privacy here.” Such surveillance could quickly proliferate in countries with leaders who want to emulate China’s brand of authoritarian capitalism. China has also exported related technology around the world – facial recognition programs, surveillance cameras – including to the UK.More aggressive behaviour signals China is happy to disengage – at least with some of the world. Chinese ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming has threatened that Britain “will pay the price” after the Government reversed on Huawei. Chinese state media vowed “public and painful retaliation,” saying Beijing may not sit for post-Brexit trade talks. British businesses including HSBC, Burberry and Jaguar Land Rover have been named targets for consumer boycotts – a move that has before been hugely damaging for foreign brands amidst diplomatic spats.But “China is not going to become a hermit kingdom,” said Ms Rolland, who sees Beijing as “asserting its own influence, authority and power...over the non-Western and developing world, rather than Western, advanced industrial democracies.” The ide, she thinks, will fall along “a difference of systems and models that are based on very fundamentally different values.” The outlines of different bubbles of influence are emerging, especially as countries face off in the global vaccine race. The US and China have “pushed ethno-nationalist rhetoric toward science and technology as a way to boost national competitiveness, national interest,” said Yangyang Cheng, a particle physicist and postdoctoral fellow at Cornell University. China has long seen STEM fields as tools of national greatness, and pre-pandemic, was already investing significantly in these areas, including biomedicine and high-end medical devices. Plans are afoot to build 30 high-grade biosafety laboratories over the next five years.The coronavirus has bolstered China’s desire to grow stronger in science. Success could help Beijing deflect widespread anger over its cover-up of the pandemic, and buoy its coronavirus-ravaged economy. Beating the West in the vaccine race might even be the ultimate sign that China has become so self-sufficient that it no longer needs to play nice with the US and the UK. It would also arm China with a tool to exert greater influence – a way to build diplomatic ties. Indeed Beijing has vowed “to give priority” to the Philippines if it develops a vaccine. Canada, on the other hand, is still waiting for vaccine doses to arrive from China after agreeing to partner in clinical trials the shipment remains stalled in customs.From a public health perspective, looking at vaccines as a way to profit is “to the collective detriment of our species,” said Ms Cheng. “That is a dangerous and really unfortunate attitude, because vaccine development and biomedical research in general should not be seen as a race,” she said. “Whatever is developed should be a public good it shouldn’t be something incentivised by financial interest or geopolitical calculations.” In China, propaganda and patriotic education are in overdrive, painting the West as the enemy. The sense is: “It’s really a hostile world out there, and we – as in the Chinese people – have to rely on ourselves,” said Ms Cheng. That nationalist sentiment resonates with most Chinese, who are proud to hail from a country that has, in their eyes, overcome all odds to yet again become a world leader – despite having been humiliated in the past by foreign powers.Beijing, tired of kowtowing to the West, is now puffing its chest with a new “wolf warrior” style of diplomacy – referring to a series of patriotic action films where the hero defends Chinese interests at home and abroad. But the idea that China and its people must band together to do battle with the enemy West hasn’t necessarily worked on everyone. Chinese with higher socioeconomic standing, like Mrs Huang, are often far more likely to believe the government is moving backwards. She admires the West’s democratic freedoms, and shakes her head disapprovingly when asked to assess the government’s virus response and whether she thinks leader Xi is taking the country in the right direction. But surveillance and suppression of dissent is so common that she doesn’t dare say his name out loud.Her family is considering immigrating to the US, though she worries whether they’d fit in as geopolitical fissures widen: “I wonder, would Americans still welcome me?”Experts hope the cracks appearing between China and the West will be temporary. Beijing has indicated interest in continuing to work together, though on its own terms. “It’s really tragic...this pandemic should have made people less narrow-minded, less nationalistic, because what it has taught us is that nations and human bodies are all porous entities,” said Ms Cheng. Determining and agreeing to new rules of engagement will be difficult. Mid-sized countries, like the UK, are “trying to find their own path in dealing with that overarching rivalry between the US and China, between these two,” said Ms Rolland. “It’s going to get a lot more complicated with European countries, because their whole model rests on the same basis and fundamental values as the Americans, rather than China.”“The worst case scenario is not a cold war,” said Mr Chorzempa. “It’s something much worse, much more confrontational.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"israel normalise relations uae historic deal","story":"Donald Trump, the US president, said on Thursday that the United Arab Emirates and Israel have agreed to establish full diplomatic ties as part of a deal to halt the annexation of occupied land sought by the Palestinians for their future state.The announcement makes the UAE the first Gulf Arab state to do so and only the third Arab nation to have active diplomatic ties to Israel.Trump tweeted a statement from the countries, acknowledging the deal.

They are extremely concerned about the detrimental impact on their students.We are now calling on the Government and the exam regulator Ofqual to review the situation as a matter of urgency, and we would warn them against simply digging in their heels and insisting all is well.The Sixth Form Colleges Association said: The process for calculating this year\u0027s A-level results appears to have fundamentally failed, based on our survey of sixth form colleges. The association said the Government and Ofqual must now revert to teacher-assessed grades.Read more: A-level results day 2020 - live updatesThis year\u0027s grades have been calculated by a statistical model, which took into account various factors including pupils\u0027 past performance as well as their school\u0027s historic grades, combined with the rank order drawn up by teachers.Ofqual came up with model to calculate grades and teachers were asked to put students in a rank order of best to worst.Earlier this week, Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, apologised for the disruption students have faced but refused to back down over the use of an algorithm to calculate A-level results.Mr Williamson said that, if teachers\u0027 predictions were awarded to pupils unaltered, grades would shoot up and the qualifications would be devalued.On Wednesday evening, he made an 11th hour change to the system which meant pupils could now appeal against their grade on the basis of their mock exam results.It was the latest in a series of last-minute changes to the appeals system ahead of results day and followed a major U-turn by the Scottish Government which threw Whitehall into a panic about how to head off a similar crisis.John Swinney, the Scottish education minister, announced on Tuesday that the 124,564 grades that had been downgraded by the Scottish algorithm would be withdrawn and replaced with teachers\u0027 recommendations.The Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, pledged to introduce a safety net meaning students would not get a lower A-level grade than their AS mark.Unlike in England, where AS levels were axed under a series of reforms to toughen up A-levels, they remain in place in Wales, meaning they can be relied on as an indicator of a pupil\u0027s performance in exam conditions.Read more: A-level results day guide to clearing, grades and next stepsMr Williamson gave his assurance on Thursday that he will not make the same exam grades U-turn seen in Scotland.What is clear to me is there will be some youngsters, no matter how much we try to do in terms of this system to maximise the fairness of it, who don\u0027t get the grade they should have potentially have got, he said.That\u0027s why we need to have a really robust system, that\u0027s why we\u0027ve got the triple lock.Mr Williamson said this would provide robust grounds of appeal and allow pupils to take exams later in the year if required.But despite claims that Ofqual has no system in place for assessing the validity of mock exam results, the Education Secretary said there was a whole range of routes that schools can take the appeal process through, adding that the mock exam was an important step forward to ensure there\u0027s enhanced fairness for all pupils right across England.He said more information about appeals would be released to schools and colleges over the next few days.Languages and mathematics saw the highest proportion receiving the top grades (see graphic below) amid a fall in the total number of entries sitting.Two thirds (66.1 per cent) of those sitting modern languages other than French, Spanish and German received either A* or A, up 15 percentage points on last year.For further mathematics it was 61.8 per cent, up 8.3 percentage points on last year.Some of the subjects receiving lowest proportion of the coveted top grades (see graphic below) were English language (11.4 per cent), media, film and TV studies (13.8 per cent) and business studies (15.2 per cent).The 2019 A-Level cohort saw the proportion of entries among girls sitting the three main science subjects – biology, chemistry and physics – overtake boys for the first time since 2011.That trend has continued, with the gap between the genders widening in 2020 (see graphic below).The proportion of entries into the sciences among girls rose from 50.3 per cent in 2019 to 50.9 per cent this year. But overall entries into sciences mirror the wider trend, with falling numbers of entries across the board.Around 10,000 fewer entries were made among girls in 2020 across the sciences among girls from the previous year, and 11,000 fewer entries among boys.More girls are sitting biology (38,067 entries among girls vs 21,406 among boys) and chemistry (28,120 vs 23,730 boys), but more boys are still sitting exams in physics (7,997 girls vs 26,999 boys).But girls achieved higher grades than boys in physics, with 33.7 per cent achieving A* and A, versus 29.8 per cent among boys.Girls also performed better in biology (25.3 per cent achieving the top grades vs 23.7 per cent for boys), but boys did best in chemistry (32.1 per cent for boys vs 28.9 per cent for girls).Overall, girls made up 55.4 per cent of all A-Level entries in 2020, up from 55 per cent in 2019 and 2018.It has been the best year for attainment among both boys and girls, with the former achieving 27.1 per cent A* and A (up 1.9pp on 25.2 per cent in 2019) and the latter achieving 28 per cent A and A* (up 2.9pp from 25.1 per cent in 2019). More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon has put populism ahead fairness exam grade free","story":"The dramatic announcement on Tuesday in Scotland over students’ exam results, allowing teaching assessments to stand as students’ final grades, is riven with public emotion.While Gavin Williamson offered a compromise deal in England, allowing students to use their mock results if higher than their actual outcomes, the Government has steadfastly avoided political short-termist thinking, refusing to follow Scotland’s lead where sensible standardisation measures have been thrown out of the window in favour of political opportunism.Nicola Sturgeon’s U-turn is populism at its worst, flying in the face of fairness – the holy grail that exam regulators have been attempting to pin down this year in the absence of exams due to the coronavirus pandemic.England’s approach is a complicated model comparing a prioritised list of student outcomes, with multiple avenues of appeal and comparison against their school’s previous results. It attempts to maintain standards and so protect the currency of qualifications, rather than allow rampant grade inflation which serves no one.This is by no means ideal, but – to borrow a Churchillian turn of phrase – it is only the worst way of delivering students\u0027 results except for all the others. Among those clamouring for a similar change of heart in England as in Scotland, the argument goes something like this: results on a national level aren’t important, as league tables and accountability for schools have been suspended this year, while inidual results have a significant impact on a young person’s future forever. Teacher assessments should therefore stand, regardless of whether they would have seen results leap by 12 percentage points.But surely, if the argument is that inidual results should take precedence over any attempt to standardise, then all children should be given an A* at A-level or grade 9 at GCSE. All kids would then get perfect results and therefore equal access to universities, apprenticeships or employment in the future.Yet giving everyone A*s and 9s would help no-one. Both the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) and Ofqual, England’s regulator, knew this months ago and as a result had spent that time building standardisation models that were tested within an inch of their lives to make the process as fair as possible.Centre assessed grades are the heart of the row in Scotland. In laymen’s terms this means predicted grades – teachers forecasting the results of their students before taking an exam.In England these are still used as part of a young person’s application to a university – something that is quite unique internationally. But research has shown that in university applications only 16 per cent of applicants were correctly predicted their A-Level outcomes – clearly putting into question the reliability of this model.All the research points to the fact that teachers are over-generous in their grading, but when compared with national benchmarks, there are also significant concerns that students from black and minority ethnic backgrounds are likely to be under-predicted. This is conscious or unconscious bias in action.Much of the national debate this week has focused on how fair the results were for those Scottish students who were downgraded. No system is fair – which is just as true for basing grades entirely on teacher predictions. It is unfair to students whose teachers did not try to game the system but worked within the boundaries the Scottish government laid out. Compare the school that decided tactically to give the top grades to as many students as possible, regardless of performance, with the school that diligently worked through what grades students truly deserved.Think of the agonising that teachers themselves will now be going through, going over in their minds every grade they allocated and every decision they made. And of course, it is also unfair to all students in Scotland whose grades now, in Nicola Sturgeon’s own words, have no credibility. Most of all, it is unfair on those kids for whom their results mean they won’t get into a university in England because they are competing against English students, where the overall system to grade students this year carries weight. Consider those that do get into the university of their choice but find that they are unable to engage with the content because they missed out on vital teaching in core subjects. And spare a thought too for those who will go through interview processes to get their first job – up against others with exam results from 2019 or 2021 – and who won’t get the position because the employer can’t trust in their results.It is clearly not possible to judge with 100 per cent accuracy which pupil would have passed or failed based on their skills and knowledge in any system that does not have standardised testing. And there is still more to do to ensure fairness in England, particularly waiving appeal fees for students unhappy with their grades.But by holding firm on Ofqual’s standardisation, the UK Government has prioritised children’s futures over populism.  They have protected a young person’s results for life from knee-jerk, politically charged decisions – exactly like the one taken by John Swinney and Nicola Sturgeon on Tuesday.All in all, political expediency must not trump what is right and what it genuinely fair – not just to this year’s students, but students past and future too.Unity Howard is director of the New Schools NetworkMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"oldham brink full lockdown coronavirus cases surge","story":"Katrina Stephens, the director of public health for Oldham Council, said a full lockdown could take place in days rather than weeks unless people adhered to rules.Mr Burnham said a full lockdown should only be considered when everything else has been tried first, adding: To go from where we are today to full lockdown, that would present serious difficulties for the public but also for Greater Manchester services as well.He confirmed he had written to Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, alongside the Manchester City Council leader, Sir Richard Leese, to set out his concerns.Speaking during a weekly press briefing, he said: We need to see the pubs, particularly, implementing the measures, capturing people\u0027s names and addresses, so we can then make sure that the test and trace system is working as well as it should do.He also said he would be writing to the major supermarkets to call for a stricter approach to enforcing the wearing of face coverings in stores.There have been 70 confirmed cases in the region in the past week, and council leader Jonathan Nunn said the situation could go either way.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/12/23/coronavirus-uk.jpg","title":"uk recession economy gdp coronavirus lockdown","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Country posts worst quarterly fall in GDP on record during coronavirus lockdown\u0026nbsp– but shows signs of recovery in JuneThe UK plunged into its deepest recession on record in the first half of the year as the coronavirus lockdown saw the economy contract by more than a fifth between April and June.The economy shrank by 20.4 per cent in the second quarter of the year, worse than any other G7 nation, taking the UK into its first recession since the 2008-2009 financial crisis.The dramatic fall in output came after a 2.2 per cent drop in the first three months of the year.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA recession is defined as two successive quarters of decline in GDP. The US and eurozone have both already been confirmed as being in recession.There were signs of a recovery beginning, as monthly gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 8.7 per cent in June but is 17.2 per cent below February 2020 levels, the Office for National Statistics said.Britain faces up to the prospect of mass unemploymentSurvey results showed that businesses are increasing output as demand has risen following the easing of social distancing and lockdown measures.Manufacturing, construction and services all experienced widespread growth in June as businesses were allowed to resume trading, but output in all three sectors remained significantly below pre-pandemic levels.The output of service industries remains 17.6 per cent below the level of February, after growing by 7.7 per cent in June.Manufacturing remains 14.2 per cent below February levels after growing by 11 per cent since May.Construction saw the biggest fall in output and the sharpest rebound. It expanded 23.5 per cent in June as sites reopened but output is 24.8 per cent down on February levels.Some services sectors continue to be more severely affected as many businesses remain closed, the ONS said. Among the biggest declines were in the food and beverage services industry where output was barely a quarter of pre-lockdown levels in June. Government ministers and economists will be closely watching the data for signs that any recovery continued to gain momentum in July and August as pubs, restaurants, bars and hairdressers, among other businesses, were allowed to reopen.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While that was largely expected as broad sections of the economy shut down, it remains to be seen how quickly people will have returned to their old spending habits in recent weeks.  Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: “The recession brought on by the coronavirus pandemic has led to the biggest fall in quarterly GDP on record.“The economy began to bounce back in June with shops reopening, factories beginning to ramp up production and housebuilding continuing to recover.“Despite this, GDP in June still remains a sixth below its level in February, before the virus struck.“Overall, productivity saw its largest-ever fall in the second quarter. Hospitality was worst hit, with productivity in that industry falling by three-quarters in recent months.”Economists forecast that, although the coronavirus recession is unprecedentedly deep, it should be of short duration.“While the UK recession involved a record contraction, it should at least be limited to two quarters,” said Howard Archer, chief economist of the EY Item Club. “The economy has been growing at an increasing rate since May and it appeared to take a further step forward in July as lockdown restrictions were eased further.“The substantial fiscal and monetary stimulus that has been enacted should provide ongoing support to the economy.”He added: “There should also be some pent-up demand following the overall reduction in consumer spending in the second quarter, while household purchasing power is being helped by very low inflation. Global economic activity is also now improving as other economies recover from the impact of coronavirus. This will help UK exports.”Moving out of the technical recession does not mean that the economic pain is over, however. Businesses hit hard by the pandemic are expected to lay off large numbers of staff over the coming months as support measures such as the furlough scheme come to an end.Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that the ONS figures “confirm that hard times are here”.“Hundreds of thousands of people have already lost their jobs, and sadly in the coming months many more will.“But while there are difficult choices to be made ahead, we will get through this, and I can assure people that nobody will be left without hope or opportunity.”Official data showed this week that around 730,000 UK workers have been removed from the payrolls of British companies since March when the coronavirus lockdown began.The number of hours worked each week plunged by a fifth and 7.5 million people were temporarily absent from work in July.The Bank of England forecast last week that the economy will shrink by 9.5 per cent in 2020 after a rebound in the second half of the year as restrictions ease and activity gears up again.It upgraded its forecast after energy usage and travel data suggested a faster pick-up than had been predicted. The bank previously predicted a 14 per cent contraction.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

climactic velociraptor sceneAn eagle-eyed fan has noticed a blunder in the beloved 1993 movie Jurassic Park, 27 years after the film’s release.The error comes in the famous scene when velociraptors hunt down Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim (Joseph Mazzello) in one of the park’s kitchens.Posting on the MovieDetails Reddit sub-forum, the viewer wrote: “In Jurassic Park, there is a scene where the raptor opens the door to the kitchen and you can spot an operator grab the raptor’s tail.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn the film, the dinosaurs were created through a mixture of CGI and puppetry. Just as the Reddit user described, it is indeed possible to glimpse an operator’s hand just as the shot is panning away from the raptor.While other Reddit users expressed surprise at the discovery, errors like this are common in films. IMDb has identified 341 goofs in Jurassic Park, many of which are to do with continuity. Sam Neill: ‘Science was neglected, and that’s biting us on the arse’Jurassic Park actor Sam Neill says new film is ‘best yet’Certain errors in major films have become infamous over the years, such as the appearance of a white van during a battle scene in Braveheart, or the presence of bullet holes in a scene in Pulp Fiction before guns have been fired.In another Jurassic Park scene, the untrustworthy Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) is seen talking to someone by “video link”, but viewers are able to clearly discern that he is simply watching a pre-recorded video.The lead stars of Jurassic Park – Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Laura Dern – are set to reprise their roles in the upcoming Jurassic World: Dominion, which recently resumed filming, having been suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Reports say that Oxfordshire Fire Service put the fire out and that nobody was injured.The costly stunt is thought to have been six weeks in the making, with a source admitting: “Unfortunately, it was miscalculated.”Subtitles for ‘inaudible’ Avengers scene may reference X-Men characterIs Tenet a sequel to Inception? Farfetched theory explainedTimothy Dalton: ‘Why do we need to offer people gratuitous sex?’They continued: “The heat and the friction of the tyres meant that when the bike crashed, the cardboard padding sparked and went up in flames.”According to reports, Cruise is “frustrated” by the delay, with the inside calling the situation “a catastrophe”.The Independent has contacted Paramount Pictures for comment.Earlier this month, the sequel – which is being directed by Christopher McQuarrie – found itself in deep water after it was reported the film’s crew is pushing to blow up a bridge in Poland that is considered a national monument by locals.Part of the disused bridge, which is situated in the village of Pilchowice, would be detonated for the stunt.However, crew members are facing obstruction from local citizens despite Deputy Culture Minister Pawel Lewandowsk claiming that the bridge has no cultural value.Production on Mission: Impossible 7, which will be directed by Christopher McQuarrie, is set to resume in the UK in September, before heading to Poland in April.The film will be released in November 2022.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I have got them outlined and a chapter written I think of the first one, so I know it’s there.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, it could be a while before fans will be able to get their hands on the next Twilight instalments. Meyer added: “I am not ready to do that right now – I want to do something brand new.”The Twilight saga was also adapted into a hit film franchise, which starred Robert Pattinson as the sullen vampire Edward and Kristen Stewart as the love-struck mortal Bella.Midnight Sun review: Time’s up for Twilight’s twisted romanceAnna Kendrick compares working on Twilight to a ‘hostage situation’Midnight Sun has sold more than a million copies in the US in a week.In the UK, 62,460 hardback copies  were sold in the three-day window between the novel’s launch and the cut-off date for sales monitor Nielsen BookScan’s charts, which was enough to launch Meyer into the number one spot. In a two-star review for The Independent, Annie Lord wrote that Midnight Sun is “a frustrating reminder of how much of popular culture focuses on a helpless woman being saved by a troubled, yet ultimately forgivable man”.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

It was obvious this was going to be difficult but it’s been weeks or months in the coming,” he said, noting the fallout last week in Scotland where grades were downgraded for students from more deprived areas.Education secretary Gavin Williamson has insisted the system is fair and “robust”.Labour condemns downgrading of A-level results as ‘huge injustice’Keir Starmer calls on government to rethink A-level results systemProportion of students with reductions in A-level grades biggest among more deprivedThousands of A-level results downgradedLeicester University claims to be first university to accept both mock grades and published resultsThe vice-chancellor of Leicester University claimed it is the first university to accept both mock grades and published results from A-level students.Nishan Canagarajah said it would also give special consideration to students from poorer backgrounds.Commenting on data which showed the proportion of students with A-level grade reductions was biggest among the more deprived, he said: Sadly, it seems that access to university for many poorer students is being blocked again.We will break down barriers to education - especially for those who have fought through tough upbringings to forge their own path and create a better start for the next generation.We are paving the way by being the only university to give students the opportunity to join the University of Leicester based on their mock A-level results as well as their published results - whichever is higher - regardless of whether they decide to appeal or to wait for appeal.We especially want to help students from deprived areas and will take special consideration of their grades.The pandemic has already taken so much away from A-level students around the country, we universities must do what we can to give them something back.Boris Johnson says students will be able to resit examsBoris Johnson said that where pupils feel they could have done better in their results, they will be able to resit exams.The prime minister said: Where pupils are disappointed, where they feel that they could have done better, where they feel that there\u0027s an injustice been done to them, there is the possibility of appeal and they can resit, they can take a resit this autumn as well.But looking at the big picture, I think overall we\u0027ve got a very robust set of grades, plus you\u0027ve got the situation in which more pupils than ever before are getting their first choice course at university and more kids from disadvantaged backgrounds going to university.Prime minister expresses confidence in education secretaryBoris Johnson said that he has confidence in the education secretary, Gavin Williamson.The prime minister said: I think obviously it was going to be very difficult in the absence of formal proper exams this year of the kind that we normally have because of the virus, we\u0027ve had to put in the system we have.I do think it\u0027s robust and as I say, a couple of things I think are very important - first of all, more students than ever before are able to go to their university of choice, to do the course of their choice.And on your point about kids, pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, more than ever before are now able to go to university, are going to university this year as a result of the grades they\u0027ve got today.Asked if he has confidence in Mr Williamson, he said: Of course I do, but I think this is a robust system and it\u0027s one that is dependable for employers.It\u0027s very important that for years to come people should be able to look at these grades and think these are robust, these are dependable.Government urged to waive appeal feesSchool leaders’ union NAHT has called on the government to make sure there are no financial barriers to schools seeking to appeal A-level results for their students.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of NAHT, said: “The most important outcome for 2020 is that students get the results they deserve.There is an appeal system in place, and this is the key process by which any error or disadvantage can be quickly rectified. Schools and colleges must be able to utilise this to seek redress where they believe they should.“The government must make sure that there is no financial barrier to a school or college making an appeal. In the interests of fairness, and to help students, in this unprecedented situation, it is imperative that schools and colleges do not face additional costs when making appeals, or when making entries to the autumn exam series.Scottish education secretary faces vote of no confidenceScotland’s education secretary John Swinney is facing a vote of no confidence following last week’s controversy over exam results, which prompted the Scottish Government to U-turn and upgrade pupils’ results.Richard Leonard, leader of the Scottish Labour party, said Mr Swinney has “failed” to carry out his duty and “no longer commands the confidence of this chamber”.He added: “We decided that we have no choice but to table this motion of no confidence.“This is not a decision we took lightly, motions of no confidence have been laid only sparingly in the history of this parliament.”However, the motion is expected to fall at decision time despite having support from Labour, the Tories and the Lib Dems.PAOfqual must consider ethnic minority and disabled children in A-level result decisionsThe Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has warned the exams regulator for England that it must consider the equality impacts of its actions in any decisions it takes concerning A-levels.EHRC chief executive Rebecca Hilsenrath said it would consider all our powers to ensure those such as ethnic minority and disabled children were treated fairly by Ofqual.The pandemic has hit the younger generation hard.\u0026nbspEducation\u0026nbsphas been particularly disrupted, with potentially life-changing consequences for young people, particularly ethnic minority and disabled children, she said.Many of these children come from disadvantaged backgrounds. If we are going to build back better and not make things worse, it needs to start with our children\u0027s future.We have been clear with Ofqual that they must consider the equality impacts of all their actions and mitigate against any potential negative effect on these groups.We will continue to discuss this with Ofqual and consider all our powers so that ethnic minority and disabled children, for example, are treated fairly in this process.School head accuses Gavin Williamson of ignoring professional judgment of teachersGavin Williamson has been accused by a school head of ignoring the professional judgment of teachers over their students\u0027 A-level results.The education secretary was confronted by Christine Cunniffe, the principal of LVS Ascot, during an uncomfortable appearance on ITV\u0027s This Morning.Ms Cunniffe said she had seen some of her top students downgraded by two grades as a result of the system put in place by the government for moderating exam results in England.She urged the education secretary to follow the example of Scotland and abandon the system, saying students had been through enough.However, Mr Williamson said that without checks and balances to ensure consistency across the country, some schools would simply have assessed all their pupils as achieving the top grades.Ms Cunniffe said there was no longer a level playing field across the UK and demanded to know how Mr Williamson could justify the system for awarding results after the Covid-19 pandemic meant actual exams had to be cancelled.She said she was quite incensed that some students would not now be able to go to the university of their choice.I have seen some of our students go down two grades where they are at the top of the school. So there are inconsistencies, she said.Is this really the right time for checks and balances when we don\u0027t know what they are? They have been through enough, let them move on.We as professionals have given those grades in good faith, been very robust, and we have followed the consultation to a tee.Mr Williamson said the government had put in a robust appeals system for those students who were unhappy with their results but that it was essential to ensure there was consistency across the country.As a father myself, as someone who always does the absolute best for all the children right across the country, it is about trying to put as much fairness into the system as possible, he said.If you effectively rip up a whole book and say you are not having standards, not having the same sort of consistency, you will have had some schools who would have literally put in every child as either an A or an A* or a B.Huge variations between grades predicted by teachers and actual grades awarded, says SFCAThe Sixth Form Colleges Association (SFCA) said principals have found huge variations between A-level exam grades predicted by teachers and the actual grades awarded to students today.Bill Watkin, chief executive of the SFCA, said the government’s model for calculating grades this year was “flawed and unreliable”.His comment comes amid anger over the results, which saw nearly 40 per cent of results downgraded and thousands of students being disappointed.Mr Watkin said: A fundamental objective of the process was to ensure year-on-year comparability in exam results - the very clear evidence from our members is that the standardisation model has utterly failed to achieve this.”The association conducted a snap poll of 100 members, which found more than a third of principals saw their overall exam results drop below their historic performance.Mr Watkin added: “The only way the Government can rescue this situation, and ensure that thousands of students are not disadvantaged, is to base results entirely on centre-assessed grades - the predictions made by teachers.“This is the only alternative to what has proved to be a failed experiment by the Government to develop a fair process of standardisation.”Proportion of students with reductions in A-level grades biggest among more deprivedExams watchdog Ofqual has said the biggest reduction in the proportion of students awarded A-level grades of C and above after moderation was recorded within those from underprivileged backgrounds.Around 85.0 per cent of candidates classes as having a “low” socio-economic status had been predicted to achieve a C and above by their schools.But this fell to 74.6 per cent after final grades were calculated under the new moderation process, a drop of 10.4 percentage points.In contrast, the proportion of students from “high” socio-economic status awarded a C and above fell by 8.3 percentage points during the process, from 89.3 per cent to 81.0 per cent.Ofqual released a technical analysis to accompany the release of A-level results in England, and said there was no evidence that “bias” was present in the moderation system.It said differences between the change in predicted and final results was “relatively similar” across all socio-economic groups.It highlighted that the analysis did not take into account the variation in generosity from schools when predicted grades were submitted, and noted that research suggested teachers had a tendency to “overestimate to a greater extent the grades of socio-economically disadvantaged students”.Ucas Track website ‘seven times’ busier than last yearResponding to earlier reports of the Ucas website crashing as students tried to get their A-level results online, Ucas said there was a “surge in demand for our website, seven times higher than at the same point last year”.It told The Independent: “We immediately responded and increased our capacity and the service returned to normal within thirty minutes.“We apologise for the frustration this has caused, and we are here to help students throughout the day.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The US and eurozone have both already been confirmed as being in recession.There were signs of a recovery beginning, as monthly gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 8.7 per cent in June but is 17.2 per cent below February 2020 levels, the Office for National Statistics said.Britain faces up to the prospect of mass unemploymentSurvey results showed that businesses are increasing output as demand has risen following the easing of social distancing and lockdown measures.Manufacturing, construction and services all experienced widespread growth in June as businesses were allowed to resume trading, but output in all three sectors remained significantly below pre-pandemic levels.The output of service industries remains 17.6 per cent below the level of February, after growing by 7.7 per cent in June.Manufacturing remains 14.2 per cent below February levels after growing by 11 per cent since May.Construction saw the biggest fall in output and the sharpest rebound. It expanded 23.5 per cent in June as sites reopened but output is 24.8 per cent down on February levels.Some services sectors continue to be more severely affected as many businesses remain closed, the ONS said. Among the biggest declines were in the food and beverage services industry where output was barely a quarter of pre-lockdown levels in June. Government ministers and economists will be closely watching the data for signs that any recovery continued to gain momentum in July and August as pubs, restaurants, bars and hairdressers, among other businesses, were allowed to reopen.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While that was largely expected as broad sections of the economy shut down, it remains to be seen how quickly people will have returned to their old spending habits in recent weeks.  Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: “The recession brought on by the coronavirus pandemic has led to the biggest fall in quarterly GDP on record.“The economy began to bounce back in June with shops reopening, factories beginning to ramp up production and housebuilding continuing to recover.“Despite this, GDP in June still remains a sixth below its level in February, before the virus struck.“Overall, productivity saw its largest-ever fall in the second quarter. Hospitality was worst hit, with productivity in that industry falling by three-quarters in recent months.”Economists forecast that, although the coronavirus recession is unprecedentedly deep, it should be of short duration.“While the UK recession involved a record contraction, it should at least be limited to two quarters,” said Howard Archer, chief economist of the EY Item Club. “The economy has been growing at an increasing rate since May and it appeared to take a further step forward in July as lockdown restrictions were eased further.“The substantial fiscal and monetary stimulus that has been enacted should provide ongoing support to the economy.”He added: “There should also be some pent-up demand following the overall reduction in consumer spending in the second quarter, while household purchasing power is being helped by very low inflation. Global economic activity is also now improving as other economies recover from the impact of coronavirus. This will help UK exports.”Moving out of the technical recession does not mean that the economic pain is over, however. Businesses hit hard by the pandemic are expected to lay off large numbers of staff over the coming months as support measures such as the furlough scheme come to an end.Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that the ONS figures “confirm that hard times are here”.“Hundreds of thousands of people have already lost their jobs, and sadly in the coming months many more will.“But while there are difficult choices to be made ahead, we will get through this, and I can assure people that nobody will be left without hope or opportunity.”Official data showed this week that around 730,000 UK workers have been removed from the payrolls of British companies since March when the coronavirus lockdown began.The number of hours worked each week plunged by a fifth and 7.5 million people were temporarily absent from work in July.The Bank of England forecast last week that the economy will shrink by 9.5 per cent in 2020 after a rebound in the second half of the year as restrictions ease and activity gears up again.It upgraded its forecast after energy usage and travel data suggested a faster pick-up than had been predicted. The bank previously predicted a 14 per cent contraction.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.It was a particularly cold June morning in northern Kenya when rangers working in Loisaba Nature Conservancy first spotted a large male elephant limping near a watering hole. The rangers began monitoring the elephant, a large bull with enormous tusks, who was nicknamed Alan. Max Silvester, a Conservation Volunteer in Loisaba, said “the injury was likely the result of a botched poaching attempt. Alan had some of the biggest ivory I have seen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA wounded animal is liable to attack anything that comes close to it, and the elephant charged at the team who assembled to help him. “I was very afraid because he was huge,” said Loisaba’s Security Assistant Rita Orahle, who assisted KWS vet Dr Dominic Mijele.“He was trying to scare us by trumpeting because he knew he could not run away due to his injury”, said Dr Mijele. “I darted him and it became obvious that the wound was caused by a bullet which had entered the animal’s right foot, having first grazed the trunk.“After cleaning the injury and administering antibiotics I gave him an antidote and he walked off. If the elephant had been left untreated he would have been dead within a week.”All hunting is illegal in Kenya, a nation that has led the war against the plundering of wildlife, and ivory trafficking in particular. The Independent\u0027s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign was launched to call for an international effort to clamp down on poaching and the illegal trade of wild animals.Funds raised will to pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaign’s partner charity Space for Giants.

The communities around Loisaba understand the value of wildlife, and the happy result is the conservancy is a zero poaching zone - a fact that even pachyderms themselves might understand. Silvester told The Independent “it’s likely that Alan the elephant was shot elsewhere, but the intelligence of this bull, in moving quickly to a place of safety Loisaba Conservancy, allowed the rangers and the vet team to assure his wound was treated quickly and successfully.“He continues to roam Laikipia as a testament to his forefathers, the huge tuskers before him.“Orahle adds “the rangers continued to monitor the bull, and he was last spotted in early August looking happy and not limping at all.”Alan was not the only animal to be rescued in Loisaba that day. The ranger team rushed off to treat a giraffe with a split hoof. In the midst of a raging global pandemic Loisaba’s wildlife operations continue to protect endangered species, preserving bioersity and supporting local communities in the process.The wildlife veterinary unit that saved the elephant is sponsored by Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, working in collaboration with KWS, to attend wildlife cases in Laikipia.

Yesterday, the Prime Minister hit the road to inspect the measures schools have put in place.He said: “It’s not right that kids should spend more time out of school. It’s much better for their health and mental wellbeing, and obviously their educational prospects,everybody comes back full-time in September. It’s our moral duty as a country to make sure that happens.”Thanks to social distancing and hygiene measures, St Paul’s Church of England Primary School in Swanley, Kent, fully reopened in June.Here, its head teacher blasts the unions for failing children with their “can’t do” attitude. AS a country, we are trying to get back to some sort of normality — and schools have a big part to play in that.Getting children back into the classroom is vital so parents can get back to work.Yet this is proving anything but child’s play.Unions have hit schools with a checklist of  demands before opening next month. This exhaustive list includes assurances that schools will take specic measures to stop children drinking hand sanitiser, extra support for the wellbeing of staff suffering from workload worries, anxiety or the effects of trauma and insisting classes be held “one week on, one week off”.Union members have been urged to present this checklist to headteachers and to expect its completion.It is not helpful. Unions should be working with schools to ensure there is a safe , not creating ision — which is what this will do. If we keep looking at checklists of things that need to be ticked off, we will never get schools reopened.It will never be perfect for everyone. Nothing is. There are always dfering opinions.When askedthe checklist raised the bar too high, NEU president Amanda Martin responded: “This is people’s safety. What cost is safety ”Of course safety is important. But unions should be pulling together and supporting schools, rather than making it very dficult for them to come back.Before my school reopened, I was stunned to hear some unions were encouraging teachers not to engage in conversation with head-teachers. How is that helpful to anyone We have a responsibility to children to be back. If we don’t come back now, when We can’t keep putting it off. We must come back at some point and September is as good a time as any.It is about common sense and making sure the school community is as safe as it can be. Get the basics done from the off and tweak it as we go. That is how it should work.And I know — because I made it work.When we reopened our school in June we followed the guidance the Government set out to the letter.We didn’t have any cases of staff or students falling ill with the virus.We installed a marquee in our playing field to create extra space, as well as supplying portaloos and mobile handwashing facilities to keep pupils and staff safe.Classes were kept apart with inidual entrances and exits. Yes, we are a smaller school with fewer children.But I have fewer staff and less space to play with.As a community, the school came together, did the right thing and got the children back. That’s what it is about: Working with your community — the pupils, parents and staff.Inevitably, there was going to be some sort of drop in pupils’ learning. But children are really resilient. We saw that when they came back.They were straight back into six-hour days, with a full timetable of learning.They dealt with it really well. Actually, they loved coming back to the stability and routine of what they knew.As much as you try to put in a timetable at home, you don’t follow it because the environment is very dferent.I have two children myself and know how hard it was during that time . . . and I’m a teacher.My we and I were both working full-time from home. To get my six-year-old to do more than an hour’s work was incredibly dficult.You don’t get the same experience sitting in front of a screen watching a teacher online as you do being in a classroom interacting with other people.I strongly feel schools have a responsibility to give parents the opportunity to get back into some sort of normality with work.Because we brought all our children back, parents were able to work better from home and do the things they needed to do.We had a number of parents who were made redundant during lockdown.With not having the children at home, they had the chance to look for other work. Meanwhile, their kids were safe.Just this week, Professor Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the “very low” risk to children from Covid- meant the reopening of schools is safe.Research carried out in  institutions across the UK will confirm “there is very little evidence” of coronavirus transmission where pupils have ed.I hope this will help reassure parents, as the negative impact of keeping children away from classrooms runs deeper than their education.The effect on the mental health of our nation’s youngsters could be catastrophic. The social impact of schools is vital.We were back for a month before the summer holidays and that was one of the overriding factors parents talked about. Lots of children were sad, very quiet and not their normal selves during lockdown.But coming back to school really changed them. That was evident from day one.Parents had been concerned about their children’s mental health and could see how happy they were to be back at school, where they were able to interact with their friends and peers and reignite those friendships.It was wonderful to hear children laughing and enjoy- ing each other’s company.That is something you can’t get in lockdown — the social aspect of school le.Schools are at the heart of most communities.Andschools can get back safely, the rest of the community will hopefully follow back into some normality.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

meaning she could be quizzed on the stand.Mark Stephens, a leading media lawyer and partner at Howard Kennedy solicitors, told The Daily : Essentially, thats a confession that this is as near as damn it to an authorised biography.The book is filled with explosive allegations and claims as to what supposedly happened behind closed doors.One allegation was that the Prince of Wales th birthday portrait - which depicts a happy family - was actually a nightmare to plan because his sons blew hot and cold with their dad.Yesterday it was claimed Princess Eugenie was left upset after Meghan Markle and Prince Harry broke the news they were expecting a baby at her wedding.Meghan and Harry told friends and family that the duchess was pregnant at Eugenies big day at St Georges chapel at Windsor in October .The books authors wrote in the biography: A source said [Princess Eugenie] told friends she felt the couple should have waited to share the news.It comes as the biography claimed that Harry felt like he and Meghan had been thrown under a bus to protect members of the Royal Family.It was claimed the -year-old got upset as his reported feud with brother Prince William was played out publicly.A source told authors Omid Scobie and Caroline Durand: Harry was upset that it was playing out so publicly and that so much of the information being reported was wrong.There had been moments where he felt people working with his brother had put things out there to make William look good, evenit meant throwing Harry under the bus.It was a confusing time, and his head was all over the place—he didnt know who or what to believe, and he and William werent talking enough either, which made everything a lot worse. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in amongst the gloom there are some glimmers of growth.“Now is the time for everyone to rally round and really fire up the economy together.“Whether it’s going back to school or work in the office again, going to your local restaurant or pub for a meal or visiting your local shops for a bit of retail therapy,we all play our part we can relight our economic firepower together.“I know that businesses around the country have taken extraordinary steps to make sure everyone can do so confidently and safely.”The Tory big gun added: “This country has faced adversity before and come out stronger and I believe this time will be no dferent.”Mr Sunak said people should “safely” head back to work, shops and restaurants.He added: “As people get back to going shopping or going out for a meal or indeed getting back to their office they will see that it’s a new normal . . . a safe normal.“We have made changes, guidance is there to ensure that safety, and they shouldn’t be too nervous about the virus.”The Chancellor said the economy was better protected by “a new safer environment”.And he stressed: “We want to try and protect as many jobs as possible. That comes from as much of our economy ing to normal as possible.”Top economists welcomed the growth in June, which is likely to have continued in July and August.Julian Jessop, from the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: “The real news is not that the UK fell into recession in the second quarter of the year. That much we knew.“Instead, it is that the recovery that began in May accelerated in June as lockdown began to be lted.“Of course, there is still a long way to go before these green shootsthe economy to where it was before the pandemic struck. But mighty oaks grow from little acorns.” He added: “People now need to be encouraged to come off furlough and get back to work as soon as possible — whether this is for their existing employer or for another business that is better able to cope with the ‘new normal’, whatever that may prove to be.”Jonathan Athow, of the Office for National Statistics, said: “The economy began to bounce back in June, with shops reopening, factories beginning to ramp up production and house-building continuing to recover.“Despite this, GDP in June still remains a sixth below its level in February, before the virus struck.”Labour’s shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds accused the Government of mishandling the crisis as figures suggested the largest crash in Europe and the G group of nations.She said: “We’ve already got the worst excess death rate in Europe — now we’re on course for the worst recession too.”But last month she admitted the UK had a “service heavy” economy and was likely to be hit harder from lockdown than other nations.A government source accused the Labour chiefs of “playing politics”.British families are each £, worse off after the Covid- lockdown, new figures show.The Resolution Foundation, the think tank that focuses on living standards, calculated the wealth hit per family so far. Today, official figures confirmed that the economy shrank by an unprecedented . per cent in the second quarter.This was as measured by gross domestic productor output.GDP is often used to represent a country’s wealth.Not only is the UK formally in recession. It’s in the deepest recession in UK history, the deepest of any G economy, and the deepest since the invention of Gross Domestic Product. There’s a glimmer of hope buried in the grim data, though. In June, when the Government began to loosen lockdown restrictions, the economy grew an astonishing . per cent. That’s the biggest month-on-month jump since records began. It’s clear that we DO stand a chance of a relatively swt economic recovery - but onlyBrits start going about their pre-Covid lives sooner rather than later. And with hospital cases down  per cent since the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, the NHS is in no danger of being overwhelmed. Of course Covid isn’t over and we can’t be complacent. But Government scientists are attracted to long-term lockdowns because they’re trained to think about public health in the narrowest possible terms. The rest of us, though, understand that in the long run, mass poverty and unemployment kills just as surely as any disease.It’s time to get Britain working.The massive hit to output in the three months to June was £billion — or roughly £, per family.The Federation of Small Businesses is calling for a cut to NI contributions, a revamp of business rates and the “most pro-business Budget ever” in the autumn.The Institute of Economic Affairs believes the key to a strong recovery will be the continued lting of the lockdown — particularly the reopening of schools.  GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It looks good on the CV.I say “results” — of course, they are not results, as such. Instead, teachers have been tasked with deciding how well each student might have donerequired to sit an exam. These predictions are then weighted by the exam boards.As you might expect, teachers tend to overrate the abilities of their students. Not least because it makes THEM look good. In Scotland, they were over-generous to the tune of  per cent — and even more so in some “deprived” areas.The Scottish schoolkids were pretty hacked off to find their grades reduced by the boards, and moaned about it. So the Scottish government caved in and let them have their original grades. The ones that were overvalued.And so when little Jimmy proudly displays his long list of As and Bs to prospective employers — or, God help us, a university — people will just snigger.They know he can’t spell his own name or, like the rabbits in Watership Down, count past five. Nobody will take the results seriously after the Scottish government did its cowardly U-turn.Sadly for the youngsters, they will be pretty meaningless results. Which is a horrible thing to say after they’ve been studying for so long.South of the border we’re doing things a little better. Kids will be able to take the grade awarded to them. Or they can choose to use the result they got in their mocks — exams taken before Mr Covid arrived on the scene. Or they can take a special written exam in the autumn.That’s more sensible. But I suspect, even so, that employers and the universities will be a little wary of taking the results at face value. They will have their doubts.All of this has happened because we’re trying to be kind to the kids. And the reason we’re being kind is because these past six months we have let them down badly. The Government has let them down — and even more so, the teachers.Too many schools had no virtual classrooms at all during lockdown. The kids might have been sent a few worksheets. But time with their teachers was non-existent, even via Zoom.Too many teachers have been absolutely bone idle. Two-thirds of children have taken part in no virtual lessons whatsoever. Schools refused to make them — so the kids skived. And that’s in schools where there WERE regular virtual lessons.My own child, a girl of , completed five physics papers during lockdown. And being my daughter, sent them to the wrong email address. Nobody checked, nobody cared.The truth is our kids have had six months of doing nowt. Being nice to them now because we ignored their needs through spring and summer is all well and good. But it does not excuse the disgraceful behaviour of the teaching unions. Nor the failure of the Government to stand up to the unions.The result of all this will be a bigger ide than ever between poorer and richer kids. The middle classes are flocking to the private sector — where schools WILL be open and there’s always a full timetable of virtual work.For the rest — just the suspicion that they have been treated very badly indeed. By the people whose responsibility it was to look after them.It’s time Labour came clean about our teachers. Do they want the schools to reopen or not  And no more weasel words about keeping everybody safe. You cannot eliminate risk entirely, as Sir Keir Starmer well knows.We are now in a recession. Nothing will drag us out of it more quickly than the schools reopening, full-time, no s nor buts. Then the rest of us can get back to work.THE former boss of McDonald’s is in trouble for having exchanged nude pics with fellow workers.Brit Steve Easterbrook, pictured with Alesha Dixon at the London  Olympics, is also in trouble for having slept with a few colleagues.Now, those pics.I don’t knowSteve has a Whopper, a Quarter Pounder, a Big n’ Tasty – or just a chicken nugget. But nobody complained about them at the time. All of his relationships were consensual. And Steve was a orcee. What seems to me wrong is McDonald’s banning all of its staff from having relationships in-house.I WONDER how Prince Andrew has been coping during this heatwave If you remember, he explained to the BBC’s Emily Maitlis that he has an inability to sweat. Just can’t do it. He must be bursting, underneath his skin. Perhaps he will explode.Me, I’m sick of sweating.

The noncey scout leader look – it’s all the rage.The BBC was worrying about this hot spell. Wonderedit was the result of global warming.Isn’t it something to do with that thing called “summer” I seem to remember it kind of happening before, you know I’m talking about the people who, in the middle of a global pandemic, travel abroad for their holidays.

The “Glorious Twelfth”. This is when City boys and braying toffs take to the grouse moors and start blasting away at anything that moves. Especially grouse. Slow, heavy birds. Not very bright. Hard to miss them from eight yards with a -bore, evenyou’re a halfwit.It’s a bad day for the rest of us, too. And for our countryside. Grouse moors take up an astonishing eight per cent of our land. And yet they are kept solely for the grouse and the , or so numpties who try to shoot them every year.As a result, these moorlands are almost entirely devoid of wildle. Just barren deserts full of heather and nothing .And the gamekeepers burn the heather every spring – just when any songbirds might be nesting. The rest of their time is taken up shooting or trapping our most beautul and endangered birds of prey.Gamekeepers have almost wiped out our hen harriers, for example. Those moors should be teeming with le.

There are very few things better than fresh fish and really good chips by the seaside. When it’s done right it absolutely sings.”For the Ready Steady Cook favourite the emphasis should be on “texture and flavour”.He adds that the best examples have: “Sweet, rich fish coated in thin, crispy batter. Chips not too crispy and not too soft.And all of it heavily seasoned with salt and vinegar and a squeeze of lemon. I like mushy peas and tartare sauce, not ketchup.”Nick says location is also an important factor.He adds: “I’d be sitting on a big beach with a grandstand view of the ocean and Mrs Nairn by my side, eating one of the finest meals in Britain. Fish and chips by the seaside, what’s not to love.”With quarantines making international holidays less appealing, Judy Cogan asks Nick to cast his eye over some of the best seaside chippies . . .WHAT a plaice!

Luckily we had the windows closed.”TOUTED locally as the best chippie in town, it is known for its friendly service and gluten-free batter. Chips are currently made from seasonal new potatoes.Nick says: “New potatoes are new to me. It’s good to see seasonal interests at the heart of a business.“Blackpool is an iconic seaside town so fish and chips on the promenade sounds great to me.”NOT far from Tenby’s North Beach, this traditional chippie takes pride in its gluten-free batter, made on site from ground rice and potato and fried in its own special fryer.It only uses local ingredients. Nick says: “One thing I would look for in a really good fish and chip shop is locally sourced fish.“And I like that it separates its gluten free fryer from the main fryer.”THIS shop constantly refines its menu, cooking techniques and ingredients to ensure top-notch fish, mainly cod and haddock.It won the Good Catch Sustainable Seafood Award in . Nick says: “That’s a high award in the fish and chip world.Haddock is very sustainable and, for me, it’s one of the best fish on the planet, but it’s got to be spanking fresh.”EXPECT hearty portions of sustainable fish at this warm cafe inside an old, traditional fisherman’s hut on the beach.Nick says: “This sounds idyllic.

The fact that this is an organisation that is meant to be promoting our ethical standards, but also our welfare.She added: I had to put the bucket under the chair and I was wearing a long dress and had to squat down, but make sure my face was still on camera.Bar student Pete Kennedy, , of Silvertown, in east London, said: Its pretty outrageous to force students into this dilemma.This is the culmination of years of study and we are forced to terminate our exams to use the bathroom or wee in a bucket.All because we apparently cannot be trusted by our regulator, in an ethics exam of all things, not to cheat.He said students had raised the toilet break issue with the BSB but had been told the only alternative was to attend an exam centre which he did not wish to do during the coronavirus pandemic.The BSB said some , centralised examinations were due to take place this month.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The last improvised explosive device that he found resulted in catastrophic injuries, which included the loss of both of his legs.Fellow campaigner, Congresswoman Dina Titus , added: “The VA’s invasive and deadly cat experiments are sickening. You don’t have to be a cat owner like I am to recognise that.I’ll continue to work to end these similarly abusive tests on cats and redirect VA resources to humane research tools that will help improve veterans’ lives.”The Veterans Department says it has been granted approval to use felines to help Americans with debilitating illnesses.For example bladder-based research was needed as, more than  million Americans face the challenges of incontinence, frequent urination, or dysal voiding, where people struggle to pass stools.This is often related to spinal cord injury, diabetes, or ageing, which are common in the veteran population, says the VA.It aims to find better ways to diagnose and treat the causes of these problems by using devices that can monitor bladder volume and pressure under everyday conditions and in people without sensation. Cats control their bladders in ways similar to how people do, and are large enough for devices developed with them to be scalable for human use.But, the VA has been slammed by the White Coat Waste Projects as taxpayers are being forced to pay over ,-millionper year for this waste and abuse.Using the FOIA, we have obtained never-before-seen videos, photos and other documents detailing constipation experiments in a US govt lab.Cats are given spinal cord injuries, implanted with experimental devices, and then fake faeces are forced into their rectums. At the end, the cats are killed, the group says.Justin Goodman, vice president of advocacy and public policy at the taxpayer watchdog group, told The Sun: Taxpayers shouldn’t be forced to pay millions for VA bureaucrats to buy healthy cats, cripple and mutilate them, and videotape their abuse in wasteful, bizarre and deadly constipation experiments.Analysis of medical records obtained via the FOIA show the experiments and procedures cause the cats distress, seizures, bloody urine, and depression, the group found.Its accused the VA of torturing cats as young as six months old in cruel and wasteful constipation and incontinence experiments.Instead of using animals, the tests could be done in human volunteers which would give results directly related to people, WCW urged.From initial information released so far, two of the experiments show approval to use and kill  cats, the campaigners added.Purchase receipts provided by the VA shows its researchers typically buy cats for these experiments in August and September each year.All of these tests are classied as painful experiments.Since January , the VAs constipation tests have cost taxpayers about ,a year. This project is scheduled to run until December .These have been running alongside incontinence tests.Goodman said that after crucial lobbying by our watchdog group and its over two million members, Congress has drawn a line in the sand.It has cut funding for the VA’s dog tests and directed it to phase-out its wasteful experiments on cats by .But this taxpayer-funded horror show we’ve uncovered underscores that action is urgently needed right now.The VA told The Sun: Attempts to ban VA animal research are rooted in emotion – not science.It referred to a case where animal testing helped VA researchersdevelop a device that allowed a US Army Veteran to cough on his own, leading to less hospital stays, increased independence and improved quality of le.The VA said campaigns fighting such lab work would deprive such veterans of a better future.A spokesperson also told The Sun: The cat research in Cleveland is directed at reversing complications experienced by Veterans who have sustained le-threatening spinal cord injuries. These injuries cause both the digestive system and urinary bladder to lose muscle tone, resulting in severe problems with chronic constipation and the need to have an implanted catheter to void urine. These conditions not only reduce quality of le, but also can result in urinary tract infections and bowel conditions that require additional hospitalisations and repeated suffering by the Veteran.The VA says that cats are the smallest known species in which the control of bowel storage and emptying are managed as in humans.Research is to learn more about the neurophysiology mechanisms involved, so that better therapeutic approaches can be developed.Felines are also used for research on sleep, to help people suffering from sleep apnoea.

The aim of the app is to ensure people who have been in contact with a case of coronavirus, but do not know them, to be able to be tracked down and isolated in case they develop symptoms. It will log the time and distance a user has spent near to anyone, eventhey dont know them, so it can alert themnecessarythat person later tests positive for Covid-.Health Secretary Matt Hancock had pledged the ground-breaking and world-beating app would be ready by mid-May.Officials have blamed delays on the launch of the app on its ability to measure exact distances between phones. But they are now confident those glitches have been ironed out. The software works by using Bluetooth to log when another user’s smartphone has been in close proximity.A confirmed case can report their status to the app, which automatically sends out an anonymous alert to other users they may have infected urging them to self-isolate and get a free test – thus stopping further spread.Test and Trace head Baroness Dido Harding has described the app as the cherry on the cake and refused to give a date for the release of the app.But people working on the project said it is still expected to be released this year, according to Sky news. NHS England is hoping to add personal benefits to the app to help encourage people to download it.

But this could lead to a clash with Apple, who have already denied another countrys request to add a QR feature. Officials at NHS Englands innovation unit, NHSX, believe this could get more people to download the app after a series of delays and failures. The botched app cost the taxpayer £ million.

I can’t think of a greater place for them. The schools are also exceptional.”Asked how celebrities are treated in the area, he added: “People leave them alone. There’s no paparazzi here, people don’t make a fuss and allow them to have their privacy here.My guess is people will be very protective of them here, I’m a fan and we’d like to welcome them to Montecito.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

London-based buyers are also now said to be casting their net further from the capital as the pandemic has shown they can work from home.Tom Doyle, of Sandbanks estate agents Lloyds Property Group, which sold the plot, said: To anybody outside the area it might seem madness to pay £.m for a vacant plot of land.But people pay a premium for water frontage property and houses on that road sell for between £m and £m.

A*s were only introduced in .Hoowver, A-level student Megan, from Hull, received A, B, B when she was predicted three As.She bravely told GMB she would have got the required grades to go to Leeds Universityshe had taken the exams. Megan said: I got an A and two Bs. I needed three As to get into the University of Leeds.That was my three predicted grades from my teachers. So Im a bit disappointed.I think I could have got my three AsI did my exams which Im sad about.I think I deserved three As, so its annoying. Im just hoping Leeds will let me in with these grades. Her principal Mr Britain said: Its completely unfair when students like Megan when an algorithm, some sort of standardisation process has meant she hasnt got the grades that she should have got.Yes, hopefully youll still get into the university, but its still not right that these young people havent got the correct grades.Students were left in tears after being disappointed with their results - with some even burning their letters.Abby, from Hull, admitted to breaking down after seeing her results after receiving D, D, E grades in her A-level subjects – meaning she missed both her firm and insurance university places.She told the BBC: “My future has been set back completely. I might have to wait one or two years now to go to university.“There’s been loads of people crying, not getting the results they wanted, and it’s down to something that wasn’t our choice.Lilly Keeley Watts achieved A*, A, C meaning she didnt get her place at Durham University even though she says she knows she deserved more than a C.I have called up this morning and I havent got in. I am absolutely gutted. I know our school has been hit by these science grades.On the verge of tears she told IV: I know I deserve more than a C in biology. I dont want to be big headed, but I know I would have done better than that.Its very unfair that because of past performance in this area and in my school, that I havent got in. Its heartbreaking seeing my friends upset because they havent got in because of previous results, because of what school you go to. It shouldnt determine how you can do.Abbie Cooper, an AS-level student from Cwmbran, said she was distraught after receiving two Ds and a U.The -year-old said: Last year I couldnt attend college a lot due to anxiety and mental health issues but any time I did a mock or a piece of work Id still get a D, a C or a B. The Ds that I did get had been improved to a B and a C at the end of the year, and my predicted at the end of the year was a B-B-B.I thought Id pretty much secured at least a C, but I checked my results this morning and it said U-D-D.In a snap poll run by The Student Room this morning, already close to % of students have already responded saying that their A-Level grades were worse than expected. One student commented “I honestly have a rock in my stomach, I wanna get blackout drunk and just cry right now. I got predicted a ABC and just received CCE, I got all s and s during GCSEs and didnt do well during mocks but at worst expected BCD or something like that. I cant even apply for clearing with hope.A number of parents and relatives also took to social media to vent their frustrations after seeing their family members predicted results drop.One dad, Nick Day, tweeted his dismay at his daughters results being marked down blasted: My daughter, whose predicted A-level grades were A,B,B has just been ‘awarded’ C,C,C and all of her UCAS offerstr have been withdrawn. @GavinWilliamson@BorisJohnson You are an utter disgrace and we won’t put up with this #AlevelResults.Another added: Please can someone explain to me how my god-daughter, who was predicted A, B, C, can be given B, D, U for her A-level results. Ungraded ! It’s outrageous!However, after record high grades for many, other pupils were delighted with their marks.Lorna Gauvain, , collected three A* grades at Norwich School and plans to study forensic psychology at the University of Kent starting in  after a year out.She said the results are what she was hoping for but added: For the first few months it didnt really feel like they were going to be our results.Lorna, who lives near Wroxham in Norfolk, said: I was happy and very relieved.Identical twin sisters Arianne and Enyala Banks are setting off to Oxford University together, too.Arianne will study Law with French Law at Mansfield College - while Enyala will read Materials Science at Queen’s College.A Level student James, from Brighton, is overjoyed after beating leukemia and smashing his exams.During chemotherapy he focused on academics as he was unable to play sports other than tennis. Having secured ten -s in his GCSEs, James is now celebrating outstanding A*A*A*A results . He has beaten leukemia, and plans to study Economics at Warwick University. Kids cant launch an appeal, but the schools can do it for them. And they can use their mocks to help decide on a grade after a last-minute change of plan.However, exams regulator Ofqual havent yet set out the details of how to submit these appeals - and what mocks will be valid to use.Students can also choose to sit the exam in the autumn too, and pick the best mark they have available. GIRLS beat boys in the number of pass grades achieved at A-levels and the number of kids who managed an A* or A. The number of female students achieving a pass hit . per cent this year in comparison to . per cent of boys. The gap between boys and girls has grown from  per cent in  and  to . per cent this year. More boys were given an A* with . per cent being awarded the top mark, in comparison to . per cent of girls. But overall more girls achieved either an A or A* with . per cent compared to . per cent of boys. More girls are also taking sciences - biology, chemistry or physics - at A-level, according to data from Ofqual.The number of boys dropping language subjects also fell by . per cent, while female entries in French, German or Spanish rose by . per cent.Some schools will today send out the teacher-predicted results they would have got to kids - who can then decide whether to appeal or not.Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, has been under fire for the last minute change of appeals process - which isnt yet ready for kids to use.And he refused to apologise for the standardising system which led to grade being marked down.The Cabinet minister told Sky News: If we do not have checks and balances within the the system youll have even greater unfairness.Potentially some people would take advantage of the fact that there arent checks and balances.He defended not ditching standardised grades and using teachers ones in a fiery exchange on This Morning.Mr Williamson was confronted by Christine Cunnfe, the principal of LVS Ascot.Ms Cunnfe said she had seen some of her top students downgraded by two grades as a result of the system put in place by the Government for moderating exam results in England.She urged the Education Secretary to follow the example of Scotland and abandon the system, saying students had been through enough.But he told the show:: “Well, overtime they [students] are in competition and you have to have some consistency in terms of grades. We have to be sure that we maintain standards… Not having standards, not having the same level of consistency, we’ve had some schools, for example, that have put every child in as either an A or an A* or B.”Meanwhile heads and teachers lashed out at the results today.A survey of sixth form college principals suggested the process for calculating this years A level grades is flawed and unreliable.The Sixth Form Colleges Association said that switching to grades predicted by teachers is the only way to address failure of the system.Commenting on today’s A-level results in England, Geoff Barton, General Secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the system was having a devastating impact on kids today.He blasted: “While there has been an overall increase in top grades, we are very concerned that this disguises a great deal of volatility among the results at school and student level.“We have received heartbreaking feedback from school leaders about grades being pulled down in a way that they feel to be utterly unfair and unfathomable. They are extremely concerned about the detrimental impact on their students.This is in terms of both the number of grades lowered, and some students’ results being pulled down by more than one grade.He said the way kids get their grades has created clear injustices.Teachers are calling on the Government to review the system as a matter of urgency but Mr Williamson has insisted there will be no more changes.Mr Barton added: “We have done everything we possibly can to support the grading process in dficult circumstances, but there is a time to say enough is enough.”Michelle Meadows from Ofqual admitted that poorer kids did have their grades pulled down more than richer ones.She said earlier today: “The research literature shows of A-level predictions for university entrance is that there is a tendency to be more generous for students of lower socio economic status.“So there will be a tendency for there to be more generosity.“The important thing is to look at the analysis for the end grades students take away – you can see there is no evidence of systematic bias.”According to UCAS, a total of , people, from the UK and overseas, have had university places confirmed - an increase of .%.Ministers have urged universities to be flexible and take into account a range of evidence when choosing which youngsters to admit to their degree courses on Thursday in the wake of coronavirus. Clare Marchant, the Chief Executive of UCAS, said that this will be a “big year for clearing” following the last-minute change to the appeals process.At least , students are expected to go into Clearing, in comparison to last year’s ,, according to Marchant.Phones have been “ringing off the hook” in the call centre at Bristol University this morning - as thousands of students attempt to secure places amid A-level grading confusion.Here are the rates for students receiving the top grades : Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Exam boards downgraded nearly two in fiveresults - amounting to some , grades, according to data by Ofqual. Teachers had predicted results for students unable to take their summer exams due to the pandemic. But many school leavers were left disappointed when their grades were lowered by a computer model designed to standardise grades. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson announced last-minute changes on Tuesday to allow pupils who want to appeal to use their mock result or sit an exam in the autumn. He is now facing calls to overhaul the system following mass downgrading of marks, and evidence showing that poorer pupils have been hardest hit. Here we take a look at the data. The poorest pupils are the most likely to see their marks downgraded Pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds were most likely to be marked down in their results. Some % of teenagers from the poorest households were predicted to get C or above by their teachers - but this fell to .% under the new moderation process - a drop of . percentage points. Pupils from middle-income backgrounds also saw their marks downgraded, from .% to .% - a fall of .%. Students from the wealthiest families fared best, as numbers awarded a C and above fell by . points during the process, from .% to %. Private schools have seen the biggest boost in top marks  Pupils at state schools and sixth forms colleges were more likely to lose out in the A-Levels chaos than private school children. Data from the exams watchdog shows a .% increase in A grades for independent school pupils compared to last year. State sixth forms and colleges saw an .% increase in the top marks, while the number of comprehensive pupils attaining A grades rose by %. Selective state schools saw .% increase from  and academies saw a .% rise. And surprise surprise, schools in the North lose out  In a blow to Boris Johnsonaposs levelling up agenda, schools in the North saw the lowest increases in A grades. Pupils in the North East and the North West had the smallest rises in top marks of .% and .% respectively. Schools in the East Midlands saw the biggest rise in A grades on .%, followed by London on .% and the South West on .%. The South East and Eastern region saw an increase of .% each. Schools in Yorkshire and Humber and the West Midlands reported an increase of .%. What does the exams regulator say  Dr Michelle Meadows, executive director for strategy, risk and research at Ofqual, said its analyses showed there was no evidence of systematic bias in the exam assessment model used this year. She added: Outcomes for dferent groups, whether that be by socio-economic status, ethnicity, gender, the outcomes for these groups are very similar to those in previous years. Askedthere was a relationship between social disadvantage and the moderation of exam results, she said: There was a tendency for some more generosity to be there in the predictions for students with lower socio-economic status, backgrounds. She added: There is a small effect of a greater dference between the end calculated grades and the centre assessment grades. What does the Government say   Mr Williamson insisted the Government would not be making further changes to the system - despite a similar u-turn in Scotland earlier this week. We believe that weaposve put in place - in terms of the triple lock, in terms of the actions weaposve taken - a system that is able to put its arm round those youngsters where there has been a grade that has been unfair on them and is able to put that right, he told Times Radio. He claimed that the most disadvantaged pupils would be at high risk of losing out compared to their wealthier peersexams had been delayed rather than cancelled. What do critics say  Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , demanded a review of the moderation process in England as a matter of urgency. He said: We would warn them [the Government] against simply digging in their heels, and insisting all is well. The Association of Collegeshas also called for a review of the process. We cannot stand by when the evidence suggests that many thousands of students may have missed out on their grades because of a systemic bias, said its Chief Executive David Hughes.

The grandfather has been blown away by the outpouring of love - and donations - from around the UK. He said: I think thataposs absolutely enormous. At no time when we started off with this exercise did we anticipate weaposd get anything near that sort of money. It just shows that people have such high regard for matters of our National Health Service and itaposs really amazing that people have paid so much money. And his amazing achievement has been praised by politicians, celebrities and his millions of fans. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: Captain Tom, he has served his country in the past and heaposs serving his country now, both raising that money for the NHS, for which I know NHS charities are going to be incredibly proud and grateful, but also cheering us all up. And we all need a bit of cheering up sometimes. Captain Tom has first-hand experience of the NHS after he was treated for skin cancer several years ago. He also heaped praised on the doctors and nurses who cared for him following his hip replacement after a fall in his kitchen. Born in Keighley in West Yorkshire, Captain Tom attended the local grammar school before training as a civil engineer.

But then, aged , he met his beloved we Pamela and finally found his happy ending, getting married in . She was  and working as an office manager when Captain Tom first met her. He said: As it so happened, the office manager in Gravesend was a rather attractive young lady – she looked terric to me, like a model – so I had to do ious trips and, shall we say, the ­attraction with the office manager became stronger and I eventually married her.  The couple had two daughters, Lucy and Hannah. He describes their marriage as a happy time and the devoted couple loved the simple things in le. Captain Tom joked: Pamela loved nothing more than a trip to Marks  Spencer. That was her dream day out, so we did that a lot.

Thunder storms and torrential rain caused the mobile homes to slide down a hill, sparking a huge emergency service presence. The landslide happened at Pettycur Bay in Fe, Scotland last night. Shocking snaps showed caravans had crashed into one another as they slipped down the slope of the holiday park, Daily Star reports. Glen McGill was one of the hundreds who was evacuated from his holiday home during the incident. He said: “We had hours and hours of the most horrendous lighting and heavy rain from at least pm to am. Were you one of those evacuated  Email webnews@mirror “I’ve never seen anything like it. No gaps between lighting– more like constant flickering like an electrical outage.” The landslide even blocked part of the nearby railway and even shut the A between Kinghorn and Burntisland. Officers urged drivers to avoid the area as emergency services worked to reopen the road.  Captioning photos that were uploaded in the early hours of the morning, Glen said: “We’ve just been evacuated from our caravan due to danger of landslip. “One along from us is already slipping. No sleep tonight as road out blocked both ways.” He then added: “All caravans now being evacuated at Pettycur. “Main road blocked to either side with landslips though Burntisland side might be passable for emergency vehicles.  “A lot of mud and a few vans where they shouldn’t be. Just hope the ground isn’t any more unstable.” Thankfully, it is understood that no one was injured in the landslide. All the holidaygoers were instead moved from their homes and were housed in the main Bay Hotel for the night.  A Police Scotland spokesman said: “Adverse weather conditions in the area of Pettycur Bay Caravan Park, Kinghorn, has caused a landslide. “Emergency services were called to this location shortly after .pm last night. “A landslide had blocked part of the railway line this area and has also caused the closure of A between Kinghorn and Burntisland.

Devastated pupils from Mulberry School for Girls in east London, have slammed the governmentaposs grading system, saying it is flawed and biased against poorer students after receiving their heartbreaking results. The school serves girls living in Poplar and Limehouse in east London - the area in the UK with the highest level of child poverty - so many of its pupils aim to educate their way out of deprivation. According to several pupils at the school, many A-level students had results downgraded leaving many scrambling to find university places as conditional offers were withdrawn. Eighteen-year-old Thamima, who lives in Tower Hamlets but attended a school in west London after winning a scholarship, said it was disappointing from a government supposed to be promoting social mobility. Local councillors said the downgrading was disgusting and that young people deserve so much better.Due to the coronavirus pandemic closing schools for months, pupils were unable to sit their exams so instead teachers submitted assessment grades , saying what they expected students to achieve. Have your grades been affected  Email us at webnews@mirror.But today exam chiefs said nearly % of students were awarded lower grades than their teachers had recommended, otherwise national results would have been implausibly high. According to several pupils at Mulberry School nearly everyone in the sixth-form had at least one subject downgraded. Abida Mostafa, , from Bow, east London, had predicted grades of A*-A*-B but instead she was given A*-A-C. She toldshe had an offer at University College London to read comparative literature provided she received her predicted grades. Luckily the university said she can keep her place but Abida said it was heartbreaking that she will never get the chance to prove she was capable of achieving the higher grades.  If I had sat the real exams I know I would have done better, she said. Almost everyone in my school has suffered at least one downgrade. I donapost understand how the government can standardise a system that was already flawed as we are already live in a disadvantaged area. Iaposm lucky as I kept my university places but others havenapost. I just will never get the chance to reflect my true A-level potential. Another A-level student at the school wasnapost so lucky. The -year-old, who wishes to be anonymous, has lost two university offers to study medicine.When the Mirror spoke to her she was trying to get through to the UCAS clearing system to find an alternative university place. She said: I am desperately trying to find somewhere  to go. This highlights how the education system is stacked against the poorest pupils as the results do not show our true abilities. The Government should have listened to our teachers, not use a standardised system that penalises the poorest.  If we had been allowed to sit our exams we would have done so much better. The Office of Qualications and Examinations Regulationadmitted .% of students had one grade knocked off, with .% of results downgraded altogether. Explaining the decision to downgrade grades, Ofqual said: Our initial analysis of the CAGs showed that they were, in general, optimisticand the combined effect would be likely to lead to overall national results that were implausibly high. If we had awarded grades based on CAGs we would have seen overall results increase by far more than we have ever seen in a single year. At A level, we would have seen the percentage of A* grades go up by  percentage points from .% of grades in  to .% of grades this year, and the percentage of grades that were B and above increase by over  percentage points from .% in  to % this year.  Eighteen-year-old Thamima who lives in Tower Hamlets did get the grades she was predicted. But she said she believes its because she studied for her A-levels at a school in West London after winning a scholarship there. So unlike her friends she will be going to the university of her choice - Oxford. She told : Almost everyone I have spoken to have had at least one subject downgraded. This is disappointing from a Government that is supposed to be promoting social mobility.

Greggs launched its Quorn sausage roll as an experiment and found it was a runaway success. That proved to be just the beginning. For me the start was in childhood. My dad, a health freak, used to go in for “nut meat” which my mum did her best to dress up by grilling to make it more palatable for my sister and me. We hated it.Fast forward a few decades and the big fast-food chains have found fake meat to be popular. Burger King’s meat-free Rebel Whopper is doing well in Europe and the UK, and McDonald’s PLTburger is on the market. Meatless burgers are on sale in all Wetherspoon pubs.

Journalists Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durandaposs -page book details private parts of the Sussexesapos lives, including the coupleaposs frustrations at le behind palace walls and fallouts within the Firm. The tell-all book is billed as the “truth” behind their decision to quit their royal duties of the start of the year, a move that shocked fans and relatives. Well placed sources have told how Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family, paints a “very one sided account” that “will leave lasting scars” on the couple’s relationships with senior royals. They tell the Mirror: “It’s sadly hard to imagine a world where this won’t do lasting damage to many of the personal relationships explored in this very one sided account.” Many questions have also been asked about how much involvement Meghan and Harry had in the book, which is filled with praise about their attempts to find a path in the family. Scobie and Durand claim they did not have interviews with the couple but instead spoke to “more than  sources, with access to the couple’s inner circle..... everything corroborated with at least two sources”.  However in the authorsapos notes on the final pages of the book, they admit they did speak to the couple. They write: We have spoken with close friends of Harry and Meghan, royal aides and palace staff , the charities and organisations they have built long-lasting relationships with and, when appropriate, the couple themselves. In many instances, we have granted sources anonymity to allow freedom to candidly provide direct quotes without their names being attributed .  A palace source said: “One may indeed wonder who those two sources are. “It’s fair to say there is a great deal of skepticism over the involvement of the book’s two primary subjects. Royal watchers have likened the book’s release to Andrew Morton’s sensational  biography of Princess Diana, titled ‘In Her Own Words’. The Princess of Wales was later revealed to have heavily corroborated with the journalist which led to a tit-for-tat airing of grievances in the media between herself and Prince Charles after their orce. Among the most shocking claims in the book is a line which says Harry believed Williamaposs staff were throwing him under the bus.

A total of  out of , employees at the Greencore-owned factory in the town have tested positive for the virus and are self-isolating. One of those to test positive is the Bakersapos Unionaposs branch secretary for Greencore Northampton, Nicolae Macari. Mr Macari told the BBC he tested positive on August , along with his mother and father - who also work at Greencore - as well as his we. He said: When suddenly three or four people are pulled out of a line because they have tested positive, people are terried. Making sandwiches seems to be much more important than everything . In the past seven days there were  new confirmed cases in Northampton alone and the infection rate is well above the county rate with  cases per , population. Leader of Northamptonshire County Council Jonathan Nunn said: We were a while ago stood at a fork in the road. Letaposs hope we have taken that road away from a local lockdown although we have to say at this stage it is not certain.  We can see the impact of all the hard that business and residents are doing but it is still up for grabs and it could go either way. Iaposd reiterate personal responsibility. In some areas we are regulated. When we go to a shop they insist we wear a mask. At work we are probably well organised. It is what we do outside of those. It is car sharing, it is going on a bus and taking your mask off. One particular thing we are keen people to engage with is track and trace. If you go into a hospitality establishment,they do not ask you for their personal details, which will enable them to alert you later,they do not ask, they have little care for you and your loved ones. If they do ask you and you resist, well actually it is you who is showing a lack of are for your loved ones.  It is still within our grasp to avoid local lockdown but we have got to keep the pressure up. Iaposm afraid we have to keep our foot on the gas and keep going. We have to continue all these initiatives. Whatever you have heard is a good precaution, just keep doing it now. Greencore has responded to the outbreak by saying it is doing everything it can to keep colleagues safe. A spokesman said: As a result of the rising number of Covid cases in the Northampton area, we took the decision to start proactively testing all of the colleagues at our Northampton site. We can confirm that a number of colleagues have tested positive for the virus and are now self-isolating. We are liaising closely with PHE East Midlands, Northamptonshire County Council and Northampton Borough Council, who are fully supportive of the controls that we have on site.

Punters and pub staff at The Hope Inn in Stockport heard a booming crack that sounded like a aposbullwhipapos as a blinding flash lit up the boozer. The bolt fried sockets and brewing equipment, set off alarms and left everyone inside apostinglingapos from the shock blast during last nightaposs thunderstorms, and left its landlords devastated. Brewer Martin Wood said he smelt sulphur and realised he had just experienced the second lightning strike of his letime - and lived to tell the tale. He said: Iaposm obviously relieved no one was hurt and the building didnapost catch fire, but at the same time Iaposm thinking - whataposs going on with   I thought it couldnapost get any worse. Then we got hit by lightning. We were just trying to get back to some kind of normality, like, and this happens. Lightning struck the road right next to the path he was been walking on when he was a paperboy of about . Reminded of the phrase aposlightning doesnapost strike twiceapos, the stunned pub owner laughed: Clearly it does. He and landlady and partner Chloe Walshaw have spent the day frantically trying to get the pub back in order after the bolt fried electrical equipment, knocked out their phone lines and destroyed vital brewing equipment. Ms Walshawaposs two-year-old daughter Emily was at her dadaposs when the lightning struck. She would normally have been sleeping upstairs in their flat above the pub. I felt so lucky it didnapost strike while Emily was home, her mum said.  The bolt rattled staff and customers and frightened the daylights out of the coupleaposs English bulldogs, Harvey and Waffle, who also live above the pub. The couple have owned The Hope Inn for seven years and had only just reopened as Englandaposs coronavirus lockdown eased on July . They had gotten through with multiple award-winning brewer Mr Woodaposs mini-kegs. But the couple had been desperate to get back up and running when they finally welcomed customers back just weeks ago. But around .pm last night, dramatic storms that chased out the heatwave and sent thunderclaps booming over northern England arrived over The Hope Inn.   The thunderclaps had been getting louder as Ms Walshaw was downstairs in the pub, and Mr Wood was upstairs in the flat. Ms Walshaw recalled: There were a lot of thunder and big flashes of light, and we were all sort of like aposthereaposs the thunderstorm again.apos There was a few that sounded louder, and we thought apositaposs getting really close.apos Suddenly a blinding flash and thunderclap lit up the pub.  The next thing we knew there was this massive sound - honestly one of the loudest things Iaposve ever heard - it sounded like a bull-whip in your eardrums. I was shaking. One of the customersapos hands was shaking and he said he could feel the electrical current moving through him. Ms Walshaw said she stood stock-still for seconds, fearful anything she touched would electrocute her. The people that were downstairs with me felt this sort of tingling sensation throughout our whole bodies.  Meanwhile, Mr Wood upstairs in the flat heard the aposbangapos and smelled sulphur, instantly transporting his memory back to a narrow miss as a lad. I was young and on my paper round and lightning hit the path I was walking on. There was a really strong smell of sulphur and a very bright flash and where it hit on the road it left this black mark. The bolt set all of the pubaposs alarms ringing, and Mr Wood rushed downstairs to find his partner and all the punters safe.  But fearing a fire or another strike, the couple ushered everyone out before checking for a blaze. Mr Wood had to smashed the pealing alarmaposs housing to turn it off. Nothing caught fire, but they found sockets fried and blackened, the phone lines, CCTV, WiFi, Sky box and a laptop were zapped, and Mr Woodaposs brewing equipment has blown out. They have spent today rushing to save the brew, as the equipment used to ferment and control temperatures is destroyed and the pub still reeks of sulpur.

The app was developed by Kingaposs College London, with data based on , swab tests done between July  and August . But scientists say there are encouraging signs from the figures, suggesting the outbreak is contained. They believe the UK is not experiencing a second wave - because some areas are still feeling the effects of the first. Although most of the affected areas are in the North of England, Thurrock in Essex and Dumfries and Galloway in Scotland have both appeared on the list for the first time.  Nevertheless, scientists are hopeful that outbreaks appear to be contained. Tim Spector, Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at Kingaposs College London, said:“It’s encouraging to see that the numbers are coming down slightly across the UK and that the isolated outbreaks in the North of England appear to be well contained so far. This is further confirmation that we aren’t at the beginning of a second wave and rather, still trying to end the first.

Little Champi was discovered with half of her body covered in coal tar and debris as she limped in pain and struggled to walk in Solapur, India. The thick mixture left her struggling to get up from the floor where she was camouflaged by leaves stuck to her coat and had been left to die. Thankfully she was found by local rescue team Animal Rahat, who sedated her before taking her off the street for treatment.Volunteers spent four days carrying out the painstaking process of carefully rubbing off the tar using vegetable oil and removing dirt from her coat.

The gang is said to have preyed on British and Irish tourists on holiday in Spain. Investigators estimate that the gangaposs leaders were raking in a shocking £.m a year from their nefarious activities. The astonishing figures came to light after  alleged members were arrested in the Majorcan capital Palma on Tuesday. The gang, which often used children in echoes of Charles Dickens’ fictional Oliver Fagin-led operation, has been described locally as Europe’s main pickpocketing gang. They are said to have been operating in Majorca for several years, with many members allegedly travelling to the sunshine island every summer specically to take advantage of the rich pickings. The pickpockets are said to have swiped items from tourists while they were distracted, or left their mobile phone and bag unattended, and are also accused of shoplting.

The group was set to appear in court today. Police made no official comment in the aftermath of the operation, which began around am on Tuesday and targeted a hostel in El Arenal east of the Majorcan capital Palma as well as a sex club and several private apartments. Bu they confirmed the huge scale of the alleged criminal operation - describing it as a military-style organisation to maximise profits. A spokesman for the National Police in Majorca said: “Their objectives were mainly tourists who holidayed in Majorca. “A total of  people have been arrested and  European Arrest warrants are going to be issued.  “Police were alerted by a rise in the number of complaints from victims who reported wallets, rucksacks, bank cards and mobile phones had been taken in areas like Palma’s old town and near the cathedral, Andratx port, and Bellver Castle. “The suspects tried to make sure the value of the objects they took never exceeded € and avoided violence and intimidation so as to ensure they always received the most lenient punishment possible under Spanish law. “Minors were sometimes used to carry out the crimes.  “The alleged authors formed part of a well-structured, hierarchical gang. “All its suspected members are Romanian. They were operating in several European countries.” Revealing how the criminals would meet up every morning in areas near hotels to “plan their day”, the spokesman added: “They would disguise themselves as tourists, with maps, and would familiarise themselves with the timetables of buses, ferries, and visiting hours for places like tourist monuments, and work until they stole the amount of money they had set themselves as a target.

Controversial video footage has emerged of a lively wedding party in Sydney, Australia, with people cheering and dancing in close proximity to each other. Guidelines in the area reportedly state that only the bride and groom are allowed on the dancefloor. But a large group of revellers at the Renaissance events venue in Lidcombe appear to be going against social distancing guidance and joining in the dancing at the event on Sunday night. Big groups of men were seen jumping on each other, according to the Daily Mail. Guests also did not appear to wear face coverings in the clip as a band of drummers played. A woman dressed as a prosecco wedding cake was also part of the reception. But guests were told to leave after they allegedly didnapost follow the venueaposs Covid-safe rules. A spokeswoman for the venue told Daily Mail Australia the bride and groom were aposvery upsetapos about guests being made to leave but did not provide further comment. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Professor Michael Kidd told Sunrise: It is beyond disappointing....it’s really unacceptable that people are not taking this incredibly seriously.

The situation will be reviewed again in a week’s time.Ms Sturgeon said: “Cases are still far higher than in any other part of the country and considerably higher than they were in Grampian before the outbreak started. So based on an assessment from the incident management team and advice from the chief medical officer, the Scottish Government’s conclusion is that it is not yet possible to lt any of the restrictions that were put in place last week for Aberdeen.”She added: “We continue to watch closely for any signs that the outbreak has spread to Aberdeenshire in any signicant way, but at present we are not placing any additional restrictions on people living in the #Shire.”Ms Sturgeon said police had reported a high level of compliance with the additional restrictions imposed last week and thanked the public for taking heed of them.Aberdeen City Council and Police Scotland had been involved in the decision to continue the local lockdown measures.She added:  “I want to stress that nobody wants these restrictions to be in place for longer than is necessary. They will be reviewed in one week’s time and as soon as we can relax any of them, then we will do.”The restrictions in Aberdeen mean:Ms Sturgeon defended the Test and Protect system when Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie asked why it had been “unable to contain” the virus in Aberdeen.Mr Rennie said the city had gone from “isolated incidents to a full regional lockdown” in a “matter of hours”.Ms Sturgeon claimed the system had worked “very effectively”, saying that the situation in the city would have been far worse without it.The first minister said Test and Protect had identied Aberdeen’s pubs as the source of the outbreak, but stressed that the first line of defence against the virus was people taking action to protect themselves against it.“Test and Protect has worked very effectively in Aberdeen,” she said. “Without test and protect, we would not be dealing with – albeit a large and complex outbreak – but one that I hope is on its way to being contained. We would already be dealing with widespread community transmission.”In response to Aberdeen South and North Kincardine MSP Maureen Watt, Ms Sturgeon said she would press the Treasury to extend the Eat Out to Help Out scheme in the city to help hospitality businesses when the restrictions are relaxed.But the first minister added that it was not yet “safe of sensible” to reopen cafes which do not have an alcohol licence, but added that the situation would be kept under review.The first minister also pledged to look at guidance on childcare arrangements for those Aberdonians who rely on grandparents based in Aberdeenshire, after the issue was raised by Aberdeen Donside MSP Mark McDonald.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

It was a wee bit early for him this evening but he is improving all the time.“We hope he comes back into things for the weekend.”There was also encouraging news regarding Jamie Robson, who was involved in a terrible head clash with Hibs player Paul McGinn.Mellon added: “He took a nasty head knock in what was a really honest challenge.“Common sense has to prevail there. Why would he want to knock himself out going for header “He came off the worst but he is all right and we have good medical people here.“We will make sure he is well looked after.”Central defender Ryan Edwards, who made his debut, came off with what looked like a hamstring injury but Mellon was upbeat, saying: “He is all right.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground. This remains the position.#We are, however, pleased to let you know that Scottish Canals is planning to re-open canals to navigation in line with the announcement that Scotland’s tourism sector is preparing to reopen during phase three of the Scottish Government route map on July .

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society. Now that it is realised how our inidual decision making makes a dference, whatever our age, we have no need to feel helpless.It is time to ask for the information and support we need."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures july 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSimon Macdonald from Kilmichael Glassary submitted this week#s featured image.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy. Teaching children the beauty of the outdoors and how to care for it can bring a lelong love for natureyou love something you usually wish to protect it.And learning never stops for any of us.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans. Executive general manager Margaret Livingstone-Evans said: “We have stayed upbeat and optimistic and have managed to generate enquiries throughout lockdown, by being creative about the ways in which we can make things happen, in a safe way.” More details at langleycastleFor more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotland"},{"url":null,"title":"creative writing how to begin","story":"Kenneth StevenUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe last few months have been a dficult and unsettling time. But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

I#d thought with it being near a pre-historic site they might say no, but he thought it sounded great. I was a bit taken aback. The forestry people were also up for it and all of a sudden it was all go,# said Gabi.Weather depending, it should take  days from start to finish. The first job is to clear brambles and other trip hazards before the lime washing can be applied.Dr Aaron Watson from Kilmartin Museum will be documenting the project.Gabi continued: #When I was researching what to white the stumps with I knew I wanted to use something traditional to Scotland that would not contaminate the place. Limewash is used to paint houses here. Then I discovered it creates crystals. Rockart was made using quartz # they would peck at rocks with it to make their marks. I liked the link. It was a good coincidence.#The shape will change depending on where it is seen from. As visitors walk towards it, it will be like an oval but once at the rockart site it will look like a circle.To follow Ormaig Landart Project follow these links:  Instagram: @gstuckemeier"},{"url":null,"title":"rest and be thankful diversion route to close for second night","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFor the second night running the old military road ersion route at the Rest and be Thankful will close.Met Office weather warnings for thunderstorms mean that the route, which runs below the landslide-hit A trunk road, will close overnight again from pm on Tuesday August  as a safety precaution.The local ersion route closed during the hours of darkness on Monday night due to forecast heavy rain, re-opening around am on Tuesday.All traffic will be erted from pm on to the standard ersion route via the A, A, A and A.

Got off the Orient Express, walking down the  to the Grand Canal and then just looked across the water, thought ‘oh my goodness!’ and got the sketchbook out. Hundreds of drawings, , photographs – I just couldn’t believe it. I still love it and I still want to paint it.‘These paintings are paintings of memories. I have a photographic memory and can always recall a sunset or particular kind of light. Often I am painting things I remember from years and years back, like the lily pond by the Crinan Canal which is gone now, but I still miss it.‘Holland blew me away when I first saw it and Venice did too. I’ve been in Argyll for  years and it blew me away too when I first came here in the s.

Reduce light from the hall. Make sure there are no electronics sending out light e.g. a digital alarm clock with a lit display, sleep buttons on equipment etc.\"You may want to put black curtains at the window or wear an eye mask to limit the light getting into the eye.\"Sleep Scotland suggests wearing an eye maskOn the other end, you should also get lots of light in the morning to help you feel awake and alert.They added: \"Exposure to light at the right time helps keep the circadian clock on the correct time schedule.\"Make sure you open the curtains and turn on the lightsyou need to. Going for a walk is a great way to start the day.\"RoutineIt is only natural that during lockdown many of us have found that we have lost our routine and have been staying up later and lying in bed

and to socialise with friends.And while most modern tech has a blue light filter, it does not filter all light.More importantly, the things you do online are usually things that stimulate your brain and make it harder to turn off when you get into bed.Therefore, Sleep Scotland say you should unplug from all screens at least an hour before bedtime.They added: \"In the hour before bed, ensure you

of cometary dust - producing up to  meteors every hour.If skies are clear, the display of celestial fireworks should be visible across the UK from about midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather

with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic being the final nail in the coffin.Staff will be made redundant, with the exception of the groundskeeper who will be retained until the estate is sold.Margot Swanston, who has visited Netherurd for  years as a guide and leader, described herself as ldquodevastated.The stunning Georgian mansion and its extensive grounds have served thousands of

dramatically this year with COVID-.ldquoEven before the pandemic came along, Girlguiding was planning to set up a digital hub to provide training online, and whilst we know the value of being together, volunteers across Scotland are finding the online or local training options more convenient in terms of both time and money.ldquoWe had hoped to build external business for mid-week, especially schools, but we were unable to build a wide enough business base to rely on this.ldquoEach year we have tried other avenues including holidays for Trefoil groups, retreats for local churches, private family gatherings and occasional weddings, but overall we could not generate enough routine business to help us improve the finances.ldquoThis was the situation before we were forced

With food storage at a premium, you dont want to let anything go to waste.Wersquove done the legwork to figure out the right ways to store your food so that it tastes best and lasts the longest.Here are the answers to ten common kitchen storage mistakes.. Youre throwing out your lsquoexpiredrsquo foodCertain expiration dates have less to do with safety than they do quality. Credit: Getty   FangXiaNuoItrsquos important to know the dference between food that has passed the lsquoBest Beforersquo date and food that has passed the lsquoUse byrsquo date. You should never eat food that has passed its lsquoUse byrsquo date, but lsquoBest Beforersquo dates often reflect quality control, not safety or nutritional value. In determiningthe food that has passed the lsquoBest Beforersquo is safe to eat read up on Food Standards Agency guidelines, use your eyes and nose, and follow your gut.Smell:If it smells fine and it was stored properly, its likely okay to eat.Sight:Donrsquot let your eyes fool you when it comes to fresh food like produce. Bumps or bruises donrsquot mean something is ruined.Dont can the cans:Canned goods can last for decades. Even a can thats started to rust should still be okay, as long as it isnt bulging and the seal is intact.Check the packaging, use your senses, cook food thoroughly, and donrsquot let the perfect become the enemy of the good. A proper understanding of expirationdates could drastically cut down on food wastemdashnot to mention wasted money out of your pocket..

Surprised . You dont know how to store your cooking oilsSome cooking oils are best stored in the cabinet, while others can be refrigerated. Credit: Getty   Angelina ZinovievaCooking oils sourced from fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds each have dferent storage needs. Exposure to oxygen, light or heat will subject oil to oxidation, eventually turning it rancid. While some cooking oils can be stored at room temperature, others do best when stored in the fridge.Corn and rapeseed oils:These do just fine stored in a cool, dark cabinet, or you can refrigerate themit takes more than a year to get through a bottle.Olive oil:Leaving olive oil out on the counter or a table, especiallythe bottle gets direct sunlight, or storing it on or near a stove are surefire ways to turn it rancid quickly. Place it in the coolest, darkest place in your home or use a smaller glass bottle in the kitchen.Peanut oil:Can be kept for as long as two yearsstored tightly capped and away from heat and light. Keeping peanut oil in the fridge may extend shelf le even further.Coconut oil:Very stable andhas a shelf le of two years or more.Avocado, grapeseed, hazelnut, sesame, truffle, walnut, safflower and sunflower:Delicate oils that are especially prone to rancidity, especiallyexposed to too much light or heat. Refrigerating after opening is recommended. Kept cold, these oils will remain viable for six months or more.. Youre using the wrong containers to store your foodWe tested the best-selling plastic and glass food storage containers on the market to find the best of the lot. We dropped them onto a linoleum floor, froze them, microwaved them, stained them, pried them apart, stacked them back together, and lots more.Best glass container:Pyrexs Cook and Eat Glass Storage Setisa great choice. Food wont leak, and the glass wont shatter. While the BPA-free lids maystain, they will come clean after a run in the dishwasher. Therersquos a vent for microwave reheats and, as long as the contents are defrosted, itrsquos also preheated oven safe.Best plastic container:Rubbermaidrsquos Easy Find Lidscontainers wonrsquot spring a leak unless you shake them violently, and drops arenrsquot a problem unless the container happens to fall on its side or a corner. No plastic container is oven-safe, but the set is marked dishwasher- and microwave-safe and carries a letime warranty. You should avoid freezing this set, as expanding food may pop the lid.. Youre incorrectly storing fruits and veggiesDo you know which vegetables should stay at room temperature, which should be kept inside a salad drawer, and which should never be stored together  Are you sure Do not refrigerate:Potatoes, onions, garlic, winter squash, tomatoes, bananas, peaches, plums, avocados, mangoes, melons, apples, pears, kiwis, and citrus. Exceptions include freezing for smoothies, or refrigerating for brief periods when theyre close to spoiling.Keep separate:Produce that emits high levels of ethylene gas, including ripe bananas, apples, stone fruit , cantaloupe, honeydew melons, mangoes, pears, ripe kiwis, tomatoes, onions, and leeks.Store alone:Ethylene-sensitive produce, including aubergine, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, caullower, cucumber, leafy greens, peas, peppers, squash, sweet potatoes, strawberries, and watermelon.,params: .push. Youre letting your avocados turn brownThere are many ways to store a cut avocado, but only one that will actually keep it from browning and preserve the flavour: Leave the pit in an avocado, and tightly wrap the half in plastic wrap to keep the flavour and texture intact.. Youre letting the food in your fridge accidentally freezeFoods in your fridge shouldnt be freezing. Credit: Getty   IssaurinkoBiting into frozen food thatrsquos merely supposed to be refrigerated isnrsquot just annoying: Freezing can completely alter the taste and texture of your food. And itrsquos probably because yoursquore probably arranging your fridge the wrong way.Check your fridges temperature settings:The ideal temperature range for the interior of your fridge is degC and below.Determine problem areas:According to appliance manufacturer GE, the most common problem areas are the top shelf, the bottom of the fridge , and door shelves.Avoid vents:Most fridges have a cooling vent above the top shelf. This is where most of the cold air comes from, so keeping food away from here may prevent freezing. Adjust your freezer:Turn up your freezer temperature settings, but nothing north of degF, which will facilitate bacterial growth and accelerate food spoilage.Check your ice maker:Make sure that your ice maker is not constantly running. This could make your freezer too cold and subsequently cause your refrigerated foods to freeze.Stock up your fridge:Refrigerators need to be well-stocked to absorb all of the cold air being vented into the cavity. If it is relatively empty, all of the cold air will sink to the bottom of the cavity and freeze your food. A fully stocked fridge will help maintain temperatures and, as a result, use less energy.. Youre not fixing a door that wont shut properlyIf your fridge door wont close, its probably due to an old, dried-out gasket, the rubber seal that runs along its edge. Luckily, the fix is simple: wash the gasket, and apply petroleum jelly to the rubber to revitalize the old rubber.. Youre not regulating your fridges temperatureA full fridge will help keep the temperature consistent. Credit: Getty   Group StudioDid you know your fridge could actually be making you sick  To keep food out of what the Food Saftey Agency calls lsquothe danger zonersquo, it needs to remain below degC. The freezer should be set to -degC to keep freezer burn at bay. If your fridge and freezer are regularly warmer than those temperatures, yoursquore risking faster spoilage. Here are a few things you can do to keep your fridge properly chilled:Invest in a fridge thermometer.To use, place the thermometer in a cup of water. Why  Your refrigerator measures the temperature of the air around your food, but you want to simulate the temperature inside your foods. Check the thermometer after  hours and then, adjust the temperature of each appliance based on the results.Check to make sure the gasket is in good shape, and seals well.If you can open the door with one finger, your seal isnt tight enough.

will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather

Farnsworth confirmed that redundancy talks were being held and pointed to the devastating impact of Covid- on the industry and Musselburghrsquos operations.However, GMB Scotland, which oversaw negotiations with East Lothian Council and Chester when the local authority brought them in to operate the racecourse, said it believed more options should have been considered.And it questioned how the award-winning course could keep up standardsthe workers involved were reduced so drastically.Benny Rankin, GMB Scotland organiser, said: ldquoWe are doing all we can to assist our members affected by these redundancies but there is no denying itrsquos a worrying indication for the future of this historic racecourse.ldquoWe believe that Chester havenrsquot explored all possible options to protect the employment of the existing workforce, including the use of the Government furlough scheme until its deadline, and this looks like the easy option rather than the right thing to do for the long-term.ldquoWe struggle to see how Musselburghrsquos five-star status can be sustainedsome of the workers who help make it what it is are losing their livelihoods, and it poses questions of the Chester management over their vision for the future of this course.Musselburgh Racecourse was run jointly by East Lothian Council and Lothians Racing Syndicate for more than a decade under the Musselburgh Joint Racing Committee.However, issues within the committee led to the British Horseracing Authority demanding an independent inquiry into its governance, which revealed a toxic relationship had developed between the two parties.The council set up Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash a new governance body ndash to oversee it as it sought a third-party operator to take over the management of the course.Staff at the racecourse at that point became council employees.When Chester took over on June , they transferred to the company.Mr Farnsworth said that the course finances had been hit by lockdown and, even when racing resumed behind closed doors, it was with no spectators or hospitality.He said: ldquoIt would be inappropriate to comment on the details but, like every racecourse in the country, we are having to review operational costs across the business in light of the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThe reality is that since we resumed racing behind closed

carry on as normal.ldquoLike every other business, be it in the sports, leisure, tourism, retail, professional services or industrial sectors, we are having to review everything we do in order to have a sustainable business, so that we can recover from the coronavirus pandemic.Kenny MacAskill, East Lothian MP, described the redundancies as ldquodeeply concerning.He said: ldquoThe change of

national outrage.In East Lothian, , pupils received some grades which had been marked down.Only  of the , young people who were due to sit SQA exams had any of their final grades increased.The results dropped through letterboxes last Tuesday and sparked a furious backlash from students who received lower grades than expected.Erin Campbell, , Member of the Scottish Youth Parliamentfor Musselburgh, said many friends had been left worried and scared after the initial results came out, warning that the fiasco had been ldquobad for their mental health.Erin, who was a sixth-year student at Musselburgh Grammar School, said: ldquoOn a personal level, I was lucky to receive the results that I needed in order to move on to university however, I am aware of a lot of young people, including close friends, who were left scared and worried after not receiving a conditional offer to uni that was reliant on these results.ldquoThis badly impacted their mental health, particularly during the period of uncertainty before [Education Secretary] John Swinneyrsquos announcement [on Tuesday].Student protests were held in Glasgow and Edinburgh and politicians piled on pressure for the Scottish Government to step in and overturn the results.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray, Labourrsquos education spokesperson, called on Mr Swinney to resign after he initially backed the modied results before bending under pressure and telling the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday the Scottish Government had got it wrong.Mr Swinney said it was ldquodeeply regrettable we got this wrong and ordered the SQA to amend awards which had been marked down back to the submitted grade provided by teachers and reissue them.Mr Gray said Mr Swinney had spent five days defending the results before changing his position on Tuesday, asking him: ldquoWhy did he defend the results of this moderation for five days  Why did he leave these young people twisting in the wind for a week, hopes and aspirations in shreds Speaking after the decision, Mr Gray said: ldquoGiven the scale of the exam results scandal, it was inevitable that many local students would have been affected. I have certainly had a number of young people and parents contacting me over the last week to express their concerns about their grades being adjusted down by the SQA and the impact it might have on their futures.ldquoThe Scottish Governmentrsquos u-turn will bring relief to these worried young people and their families as they will now see their estimated results reinstated.ldquoHowever, the fact remains they should not have had to experience this worry and uncertainty in the first place. The Education Secretary has let them down and should be held accountable for this fiasco.Schools in East Lothian were yesterdaycontacting pupils who had been affected to let them know they would receive new awards.Across the county, , grades were submitted to the SQA for pupils at the end of May across National , Higher and Advanced Higher level by their teachers.In total, , were acceptedwith  adjusted upand ,adjusted down.In terms of pupils who were due to sit the exams, the council said just over  per cent saw at least one grade marked down.Councillor Shamin Akhtar , cabinet spokesperson for education and childrenrsquos services, said: ldquoIrsquom delighted that John Swinney has finally decided to do the right thing for pupils on the exam results fiasco.ldquoYoung people have faced a very tough and stressful time already and this is something they should never have had to go through.ldquoSchool staff worked extremely hard to submit grades for their pupils to the SQA and the adjustments undermined their professional judgement.ldquoThis u-turn is a victory for young people who have led the campaign against the unfair results and should be commended for standing up for their rights.And Councillor Craig Hoy , a member of East Lothianrsquos education committee, said: ldquoI am delighted that grades have been restored to hardworking pupils in East Lothian who faced huge uncertainty over the last week for no good reason.ldquoEveryone can see that John Swinney has presided over a litany of failures, any one of which could have been a resignation issue on its own.ldquoThe SNP defended their appalling grading system to the hilt, even after it became clear that pupils, parents and teachers had no confidence in the system.On Monday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon issued an apology to students across the country who had been marked down by the SQA.She said: ldquoOur concern, which was to make sure the grades young people got were as valid as in any other year, perhaps led us to think too much about the overall system and not enough about the inidual pupil.ldquoThat has meant too many students feel they have lost out on grades they should have had, and that that has happened not as a result of anything they have done but a statistical model or algorithm.ldquoDespite our best intentions, I do acknowledge that we did not get this right and I am sorry.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council welcomed the u-turn, adding: ldquoThroughout this process our schools have sought to represent the academic achievements of our young people in a way that provided a fair and accurate reflection of attainment using the guidance and methodology provided by the SQA.ldquoThe announcement by the Education Secretary will be welcomed by young people who saw their results downgraded, and by our teachers and schools who used their professional judgement when providing grade estimates.East Lothian MP Kenny MacAskillpledged his support to headteachers in a letter at the end of last week after the original results came out.He said: ldquoI welcome the Scottish Governmentrsquos announcement.ldquoAs I said last week in a letter to East Lothianrsquos headteachers, I believe the people best placed to know about pupils are those overseeing and working alongside them during their academic journeys.ldquoThis decision is the right one, and I want to send my congratulations to all students in East Lothian for the work they have achieved both before and during this pandemic, as well as a huge thanks to the teachers and school support staff who have worked so hard over the last few months."},{"url":null,"title":"betrayal-claim-mcdonalds-musselburgh-recommended-approval","story":"In a letter to the Courier, Fraser McAllister hit out at their ldquoillogical recommendation which,approved by councillors at an online meeting next week, would grant permission for a restaurant to be created in the car park of the Tesco store off Olivebank Road.He claimed that the drive-thru, which would operate  hours a day, seven days a week, would be ldquonext to the most congested roundabout in the county.The former SNP councillor for Musselburgh West said: ldquoTragically,  local objectors and , petitioners have less value than the share value of these gigantic corporations.He called on councillors on the planning committee, which will debate the proposal on Tuesday, to halt the ldquobetrayal.Mr McAllister also lodged a formal objection, citing a range of concerns including traffic congestion, pollution, litter, obesity, residential amenity and economic damage.He claimed: ldquoThe custom predicted for this -hour McDonaldrsquos drive-thru and the intensity of the declared deliveries needed to service it are on an industrial scale. The impact on Olivebank Road would be truly calamitous.The plan will go before a lsquovirtualrsquo meeting of the planning committee after being called off the delegated list by ward councillor Stuart Currie because of the level of local concern.He said: ldquoI have called this application off the list to ensure that all the concerns raised by local residents are discussed and elected members can understand not only the strength of feeling but also the planning issues that exist as a result of this application.Musselburgh  Inveresk Community Council has lodged an objection, citing traffic congestion, emissions, and the facilityrsquos close proximity to local schools as concerns.A public campaign lsquoNo McDonaldrsquos in Musselburghrsquo was also launched in a bid to halt the plan, highlighting concerns such as increased traffic congestion, litter and air pollution.The planning report stated that there were  written representations to the application and, of these,  were objections.It said: ldquoThe councilrsquos road services advise they accept the conclusions of the traffic network modelling exercise, that the traffic impact associated with the proposed development would be minimal and there would be no adverse impact on the operation of the local highway network.ldquoMany written objections are made on the grounds of the proximity of the proposed drive-thru restaurant to Musselburgh Grammar School, and that such a facility promotes unhealthy eating and thus would lead to harmful health consequences.ldquoThe East Lothian Local Development Plan  does not contain any policies restricting the location of drive-thru restaurant facilities to a certain distance from schools, or any other educational establishments. Nor does it contain any policies relating to unhealthy eating or the health consequences of proposed developments. Thus, and in the absence of national guidance on health consequences of proposed developments, no signicant weight can be given to these matters.The report added: ldquoOn the matter of air quality, the public health and environmental protection officer advised that the proposed development was anticipated to result in up to  customer vehicles visiting the premises daily, which was a signicant number of additional vehicles given the proximity of site to the Air Quality Management Areaon Musselburgh High Street.The officer agreed with the conclusion of McDonaldrsquos Air Quality Assessment that impacts upon air quality at ldquosensitive receptors would not be signicant. The officer advised that, whilst it was acknowledged that additional traffic would have an impact upon queuing and reduce traffic speeds, the composition of the increased traffic would be from passenger cars, which are less polluting than HGVs and buses.The officer concluded that the proposed development would have ldquono harmful impact on air quality nor on the objectives of the AQMA and would not harm the amenity of the area.A McDonaldrsquos spokesperson said: ldquoWe look forward to progressing with this application and believe a new McDonaldrsquos would bring signicant investment to the local community, as well as create at least  new jobs.A supporting statement from the company added: ldquoThere are few restaurants in the country who can claim to have made so many positive changes to support healthier lestyles. McDonaldrsquos believe that the lessons they have learned in making these changes can be used to support a wider drive to reduce obesity.Planners are recommending the plan be approved with a number of conditions, including submission of litter and pest management plans.A council spokesperson declined to comment, saying the planning committee would consider the application next week."},{"url":null,"title":"wavegarden-scotland-surf-resort-takes-step-closer-reality----looks-unreal","story":"Artists drawings of the plans for Wavegarden Scotland show the extent of the project - which is hoped to create  jobs and generate up to poundmillion for the local economy every year.The visitor attraction is planned for the disused Craigpark Quarry near Ratho on the outskirts of Edinburgh.Artist impressions for the food and retail hubsThe project will involve the installation of underwater technology that can create , waves per hour, from slow moving white water for beginners through to powerful barrels up to two metres high for experts.Yesterday, the teams developer confirmed it had been backed by planners to include a food and retail hub, as well as glamping pods for accommodation.Tartan Leisure Ltd, developers of Scotlandrsquos first articial surf park, Wavegarden Scotland, received planning permission today.

Eerie comparisons with Covid asideJulias observations on the odds pregnant women in poverty already face, and the havoc wreaked on their bodies from having too many children, too young, is devastating - and fascinating - to read.Donoghue deftly weaves in politics, policy, the impact of war, feminism, violence and the minutiae of changing bed pans and sterilising instruments, while dealing with dismissive male doctors and birthing babies. And thats all alongside the awful things happening in Irish convents and childrens homes.

Gravel gardens can make it look like a beach,\" says Cha Gold medallist Perkins, whose  Facebook show garden Growing The Future will be displayed at next years show.\"You could do worse than put down four or five inches of gravel, and many seaside plants would be happy growing in it. If you have poor drainage or heavy soil, build up a gravel layer, adding sand or soil to add nutrients.:Letters: When it comes to language, lets live and let live\"A lot of coastal plants will be perfectly happy growing into that layer and many of them dont need much soil, andthey do, like sea kale, they will have a deep tap root which theyll send down to stabilise themselves.\"\"Treat your seaside garden like an alpine garden,\" says Talbot. \"You want free-draining soil, which you can build up like a rockery or clf face, incorporating shorter grasses like carex or small miscanthus, to give you the feel of the wispy grasses along the edge of the shoreline.\"Pick suitable plants\"If you like the spartan look, you could make a gravel garden planted with rivers of thyme, dwarf myrtle bushes and some evening primrose coming through it.\"Stock up on free-draining species\"Other good plants to create a sea feel would include santolinas, lavenders, silver-leaf plants and some sea poppies, which need to be planted in a very free-draining, gritty soil, with a good sand and compost mix because they dont like being in a very fertile garden. Known as the horned poppy, these perennials have lemon flowers and large, bean-like seed heads,\" continues Talbot.:Herald Diary: Getting to grips with a Titanic struggle\"Thrtis another good choice and comes in colours from white to darkish red.

You might be able to get hold of some crayfish or lobster baskets, which give an area a nice seaside feel,\" Talbot advises.\"Thick ropes, which you often see tying a boat to a mooring, are a great accessory. You can get a garden-sized boat and plant that up, putting it on a small shingle bed, with alpine grit over the top to finish.\"Display beach finds carefullyPerkins says you have to be careful when putting shells or drtwood youve found on beach-combing walks on display at random points in the garden. \"Instead of dotting things around, make a display cabinet of perhaps a series of shells, which makes sense of them being there.\"Create a beach-inspired social spot\"For me, being on the beach is about getting together in the evening and relaxed social gatherings, so I would think about fire pits, deck chairs and that sort of low-slung seating you can really relax into.

WARNING: This picture must only be used to accompany PA Feature TRAVEL Braemar.The Aberdeen-born poet and writer, whose face now adorns the Scottish pound note, made it her les quest to find the \"essential nature\" of the Cairngorms. In the process of exploring its graceful, gleaming rivers and high plateaus \"as delectable as honey\", she discovered a lot about herself too.Twice the size of the Lake District, East Scotlands Cairngorms National Park is a wilderness area of crisp, clear lochs, ancient forests and glens bristling with vibrant purple heather. Promising calm, quiet and the freedom of space, it seemed an obvious choice for a post-lockdown adventure with my mum, Gabriella.Aged over  and recovering from heart surgery, my mum had been shielding since March. Im not a fan of Zoom or FaceTime, so when we met at Heathrow airport to catch our flight to Aberdeen, it was the first time Id seen her in four months.In a world where every move seems to be dominated by Covid-, the decision to travel isnt an easy one to make at any age. But as days disappear and months march on, theres an urgency to get moving. Ive never really understood why time accelerates with age. The harder we grip, the more it slips away. Maybe its the realisation that everything is finite, including us.Then there was the risk of being indefinitely confined by anxiety.\"If I dont go out soon, Ill never have the confidence,\" my mum confessed.So, armed with face masks, sanitiser and a sensible degree of caution, we refused to be beaten by fear.Nan chose to camp her way around the Cairngorms. But weve opted for a greater degree of comfort at the Fe Arms, a regal Victorian property in the village of Braemar on the banks of the River Clunie, matched in magnicence to its surrounding mountain landscape.After having our temperatures checked, were ushered inside by the hotels welcoming ghillies who apologise profusely for the impersonality of Perspex  on reception, visors and the absence of Fes bespoke tartan blankets in rooms.Scotland only recently emerged from lockdown on July , and the hotel Is quickly adapting to a new and unfamiliar way of working. Rooms are deep cleaned between guests, breakfast buffets have been ditched in favour of timed sittings, and a one-way system is in place throughout the property.Otherwise, it all feels refreshingly normal.Owned by art dealers Iwan and Manuela Wirth , who breathed new le into its rundown shell and re-opened in , the Fe is filled with , artworks, antiques and collectables.When youve been indoors for so long, everything has a new and shiny appeal. But here in this Disneyland of culture and creativity, my mum has the wide-eyed wonder of a child embracing infinity and beyond.Paying homage to Braemars Victorian roots, furnishings reflect the grandeur of that time: an ornately carved walnut wood fireplace depicting works by Scottish poet Robert Burns dominates the reception chairs upholstered in Liberty fabrics decorate the drawing room and natural history specimens are displayed in curiosity cabinets, or used to create whimsical tableaux in bell jars. Not to everyones modern PC tastes, one corridor alone has  pieces of taxidermy, upstaged only by an eery waxwork model of Queen Victoria in the library, purchased from Madame Tussauds.If a wall of stags heads is isive, modern artworks incorporating antlers are pleasingly palatable: hanging above the main staircase, Richard Jacksons Red Deer Chandelier is a tangle of neon bagpipe drones and glass antlers.From outspoken sculptures to understated sketches, every corner of the Fe is covered in conversation-provoking art.Works by Picasso, Brueghel The Younger and Man Ray hang on walls one of Louise Bourgeois bronze spiders straddles the courtyard. But an even more impressive find are some watercolours of royal estates painted by Prince Charles and a sketch by Queen Victoria of a stag shot by her close confidant John Brown.Braemars relationship with royalty reaches back to  when Prince Albert purchased Balmoral Estate for his sovereign we. \"She was passionate about this place,\" Katy Fennema of Braemar Highland Experience tells me. The former musician, whose family have  years of history in the area, now runs local history, wilderness and wildle tours with her husband, Julian.During a morning driving tour, she shares tales of brigands hung from tree boughs, and delights in stories of Chanels fashion rival Elsa Schiaparelli, who became fascinated with Braemar when her friend, Vogue editor Frances Lovell Oldham, married a laird. The two ladies would literally go on to paint parts of the town shocking pink, and an art deco bar at the Fe is named after Elsa.Much of the land here has been shaped by aristocracy. Patchworks of charred heather on the hillside are the remnants of controlled burns, used to boost a grouse population in time for shoots.Yet so much remains wild. Along the Queens Drive walking trail, trees are laden with tufty beards of lichen, an indicator of the airs purity.At .am one morning, mum and I ramble through the Morrone Birkwood, a relic of deciduous woodland that once covered the Cairngorms. On the way up, we watch hares and red squirrels scamper through a stadium used to host the Braemar Gathering, one of the most popular Highland Games. And we detour past the house where Robert Louis Stephenson spent a miserable, rainy three months in , emerging with the first  chapters of Treasure Island.Its a very dferent scene today. Sunlight splinters through gate pickets as we clamber onto a trail scattered with pinecones. Streams trickle melodically from the mountainside and the scent of honeysuckle is dizzying.Juniper, blaeberries, meadowsweet and yarrow - so many plants thrive in this healthy environment. Later in the day, herbalist and forager Natasha Lloyd introduces us to her open-air medicine cabinet. She recommends treatments for my mums liver, and I learn how to eat a raw nettle without getting stung. The common nettle is packed with Vitamin D, which may boost the immune system against respiratory viruses such as Covid-.Fortunately, there were no cases of coronavirus in Braemar. Although one famous figure down the road made headlines: Prince Charles self-isolated at Balmoral when he fell ill at the beginning of lockdown.Its easy to see why the royals come here to escape and recuperate. This month, the Queen will arrive for her annual summer holiday. We follow one of her favourite trails through the Ballochbuie Forest, a protected tract of -year-old pines saved from felling by Queen Victoria, leading to the Honka Hut - a simple cabin where Elizabeth II likes to picnic.In the past, hikers claim to have \"run-into\" Her Royal Highness walking the corgis, but blissfully, we dont see a soul.It was silence and solitude that guided Nan Shepherd into the mountains.

Hanan and her family were captured by IS as they fled on foot, carrying their belongings.In the years that followed, the Yezidi community was subjected to what the UN has called a genocide. Yezidi men were summarily killed. Women and girls were subjected to sexual violence, including sexual slavery, and other crimes under international law. Boys were indoctrinated and forced to fight for IS.I spoke to Hanan ndash and other Yezidi women forcibly separated from their children born of sexual violence ndash for an Amnesty International report, Legacy of Terror: The Plight of Yezidi Child Survivors of ISIS.During captivity, Hanan was repeatedly raped by the IS fighter who took her as a ldquoslave, and gave birth to her daughter, Fadia. Hanan suffered four years of violence, starvation, and fear. It was Fadiarsquos love that kept her alive.She told me: ldquoWhenever I was crying, she would tell me to keep my cries inside my heart, and this kept me stronger. Fadia was amazing.When Hanan finally reached refugee a camp in Syria, she did not identy herself as Yezidi for fear of being forced to abandon Fadia. She knew the reality: children born to Yezidi women as a result of sexual violence have largely been denied a place in their mothersrsquo community, due to religious and societal pressures. Some Yezidi women willingly separated from their children, many remain anonymous in refugee camps, others stayed with their IS captors, to avoid being separated from their children. Others have been forcibly separated from their children.Hanan was identied as Yezidi, dragged to camp authorities and sent to a ldquosafe house. Her family pressured her to leave Fadia in an orphanage, on what they assured her was a short-term basis, telling her she could visit whenever she liked while arrangements were made to bring Fadia to Iraq.But when she reunited with her uncle in Iraq, he told her: ldquoForget your daughter.Since then, Hanan has been cut off from Fadia and has had no updates for months.Hanan is not alone. Other heartbroken mothers told me their situation is unbearable. Several women have attempted suicide.Hanan explained: ldquoWe donrsquot sleep. We call each other very late at night, and we cry for each other.

Independenceis a prerequisite for so many desirable changes.Mary McCabe, Glasgow G.MARK Smith concludes that by concentrating on combating the pandemic, Nicola Sturgeon has a strategy that has made both independence and her party more popular. This is a two-fold issue. The first is that polling had independence rising in popularity before the pandemic struck. The second might bolster Mr Smiths case, but as a mirror image.It is British nationalists who have continued to push the constitution as their main concern in Scotland, with a parade of little-known politicians now wandering round our country, eulogising the virtues of a Union, even while forcefully removing Scotland out of another union that had all the positives they extol. That might go some way to explaining their unpopularity in this country. We will have an election in , where British nationalism will be represented by two politicians, one who will be a peer by then and one still an MP, both of whom refuse to consider that Scots should have a say in their own future. Their policy will be apparently guided by an Australian who is being invited into interfering in the Scottish democratic process. Mr Smith should see this as a problem of British, not Scottish nationalism, because that is what it is.GR Weir, Ochiltree.ANDY Maciverproposing the formation of a new Scottish political party talks a lot about social democracy and social democratic ideology but signally fails to attempt a definition of what these old, hackneyed phrases actually mean. If we can infer that he means a free market system tempered by light-touch state interference in social and economic affairs he has to explain why, in the two biggest crises of this century, the financial collapse of  and the current pandemic, social democratic models have been set aside in favour of massive state assistance and bail-outs.I am certain that many of the New Labour politicians who oversaw economic meltdown and shameful wars in the first decade of the century would have happily understood themselves as \"social democrats\". This shameful record may explain why the Scottish urban working class, as Mr Maciver describes it, has deserted Labour.Reading Mr Macivers article closely gives a further clue to his thinking, politics as a career, not politics based on deeply held principles, this all too often has been a trait of \"social democratic\" politicians.Brian Harvey, Hamilton."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-cant-tourists-show-respect-highland-communities","story":"Sadly, this year is intolerable.Ourroads are congested, we are overwhelmed by campervanners lacking basic courtesy and driving skills, convoys of motorcycles scream around the island of Skye asit is a Moto GP circuit, and convoys of high-powered sportscars including Ferraris, Porsches and McLarens race along the A at speeds well in excess of the  mph limit.I have ed home to discover a campervanner emptying hiswaste into the ditch at the foot of my drive, friends have had their newly emptied bins filled with rubbish overspilling onto their gardens, others have come home to find campervans parked on their land and recently my we was forced off the Bealach Na Baby one of a stream of campervans despite signs clearily stating the road is unsuitable for such vehicles. The issue of so-called \"wild camping\" is separate but related.There is a myth that the NC  has been a boon to the Highlands as a whole, perpetuated by the NC organisers deleting any criticism recorded on their website, but the NC is just a series of roads that have existed for decades but which has simply been cleverly branded. It is a marketing construct, not a physical reality. There has been no investment in infrastructure, and in the west the roads are nearly all B standard and often single track.I have had access to research specic to the part of the Highlands I live in. This shows that while there has been an increase in excess of  per cent in traffic , there has only been an increase of some nine per cent in revenue and much of this is going to owners of Airbnb properties who live outside the area.Before the NC was launched, the West Highlands in the summer was full. Since then, with no additional investment, over the four summer months we are at % capacity and this year with \"staycationning\", we are at %.The standard of respect afforded our communities has plummeted.

It was our first outing since February and we felt like bears emerging from a long hibernation. We received what I would describe as a wary welcome, which suited us well, since as travellers we were as tentative as the locals. We enjoyed the novelty of shopping in the places which were open, taking care to wear masks wherever required. All the coffee-and-cake establishments we were happy to visit were models of social distancing and sanitisation, which made us feel very comfortable. So were the grocery stores and the craft shops in which we spent money.We were \"wild camping\", using secluded nooks in which to overnight our vehicle and taking care to interfere with neither passage of traffic nor local amenity. The only trace of our passing might be a bent blade of grass in the morning.The reason I write is because of the patchiness of the provision of basic facilities for travellers. Many public toilets are still closed and so are many campsites, so the availability of sites to stock up on water and dispose of waste are severely limited. As responsible travellers we found this a huge problem. Were we irresponsible travellers the temptation to chuck the rubbish over a hedge or empty the waste into the sea would have been great.Wersquoll not be venturing north again with our motorhome until we are confident that more basic facilities are open or have been developed.

Everyone wins. And all shall have prizes.:IndyRef: New poll shows % would back independence as SNP set for record Holyrood majorityMind you, I dont think Mr Swinney will be interfering in many future examinations. I cant think of any ministerial U-turn that has been quite as humiliating as this one. Not least because Mr Swinney spent half of his statement defending the very moderation system that he had just discarded.No serious government can conduct its business in this way. Mr Swinney gave no principled explanation of why he was abandoning the work of the supposedly independent SQA ndash other than that a number young people felt that the system was unjust. That is undeniably true and we all felt for them.But this capitulation leaves the SQA in an impossible position, and brings the whole examination process into question. Indeed, I dont see how the SQA can continue in its present form. Certainly, it cannot conduct its normal moderation of exam results with any confidence in future years.And nor can Mr Swinney. He must surely go now, after this fiasco, and without delay. Someone must come in to restore respect for the standards in Scottish education and serve the last rites on the Qualications Authority.Indeed, standardised assessment through competitive examinations looks to have had its day. As Mr Swinney hinted, it has become increasingly unpopular in recent years. Though every country including Finland, the leading edge of pedagogical progressivism, uses objective testing.But after this fiasco, examinations like the Highers will surely lose their unique status and will likely be supplanted by teacher estimates of ability which, according to Mr Swinney, is the most reliable way to gauge academic achievement. This, even though he himself concedes that in the past teacher assessment has been no reliable guide to exam performance.The impact on grade inflation will be as the First Minister herself forecast last week ldquoincredible. A % increase in Highers grades means that this years students will forever be marked out as the year when exam credibility went out the window.Whoever called the process by which the Scottish Qualication Authority adjusts exam scores to reflect past school performance ldquomoderation had a dry sense of humour. It has caused fury amongst teachers, pupils, parents.The anger shows no sign of moderating even after Swinneys desperate attempt to put a lid on the worst exam crisis in  years. This was a statement that was as humiliating as it was self-contradictory.:UK falls into recession after lockdown sees record contractionHe began by explaining atwhy the moderation applied by the SQA did not disproportionately downgrade students from deprived areas, as has been widely claimed. This is because the grade inflation, against historic standards, was higher in schools in these areas, at %, than in schools in more prosperous areas, which inflated by only around %. Greater moderation was therefore applied out of fairness, not classism.He then commended the SQAs ldquoopen and transparent adjustment methodology and insisted that it was ldquoin use throughout the UK and across the world\". But, er, not in Scotland any more. Mr Swinney then let the algorithmic cat out of the bag by pointing out that exam moderation happens every year to some extent as the SQA, and its English equivalent Ofqual, manipulate grade boundaries. But not presumably in future.He even announced, solemnly, that the remit of the SQAwas to ensure that every student got ldquothe qualications they deserved. The teacher estimates: ldquo awarded without moderation, he said ldquo would have led to an increase in pass rates without precedent.Sothe methodology was so fair and robust, why was he over-ruling the independent SQA and allowing this unprecedented grade inflation to take place  Well, Mr Swinney had spoken to young people who felt ldquotheir future was being determined by statistical modelling. The credibility of exam grades was of secondary importance to ldquothe risk that people would lose faith in the system. Well, they certainly will now.But does anyone seriously think that the SQA actually marked down working class students because they were living in a deprived postcode  Of course not. The SQA anyway subjected its moderation regime to an Equalities Impact Assessment ndash as it is obliged to do ndash before it published them.Moderation by algorithm is a pretty blunt instrument and doesnt take account of inidual performance. But, as Mr Swinney says, it is very widely used. Capitulating to grade inflation of up to % may win political points in the short term, but it will store up big problems for the future.:John Swinneys SQA U-Turn: Seven things you need to knowEvery year, grade boundaries move up and down to ensure fairness and comparable outcomes. Tens of thousands of pupils have their exam results routinely moderated. The English equivalent of the SQA, Ofqual, uses a very similar ldquostandardisation model against which to correct scores which depart from the historical average.Englands pandemic moderation is, according to reports, even greater than ours ndash % of grades have been adjusted downwards from the estimates provided by teachers, against % in Scotland. We wont know the final figures until tomorrowwhen the English A level results are unveiled.

Everyone wins. And all shall have prizes.:IndyRef: New poll shows % would back independence as SNP set for record Holyrood majorityMind you, I dont think Mr Swinney will be interfering in many future examinations. I cant think of any ministerial U-turn that has been quite as humiliating as this one. Not least because Mr Swinney spent half of his statement defending the very moderation system that he had just discarded.No serious government can conduct its business in this way. Mr Swinney gave no principled explanation of why he was abandoning the work of the supposedly independent SQA ndash other than that a number young people felt that the system was unjust. That is undeniably true and we all felt for them.But this capitulation leaves the SQA in an impossible position, and brings the whole examination process into question. Indeed, I dont see how the SQA can continue in its present form. Certainly, it cannot conduct its normal moderation of exam results with any confidence in future years.And nor can Mr Swinney. He must surely go now, after this fiasco, and without delay. Someone must come in to restore respect for the standards in Scottish education and serve the last rites on the Qualications Authority.Indeed, standardised assessment through competitive examinations looks to have had its day. As Mr Swinney hinted, it has become increasingly unpopular in recent years. Though every country including Finland, the leading edge of pedagogical progressivism, uses objective testing.But after this fiasco, examinations like the Highers will surely lose their unique status and will likely be supplanted by teacher estimates of ability which, according to Mr Swinney, is the most reliable way to gauge academic achievement. This, even though he himself concedes that in the past teacher assessment has been no reliable guide to exam performance.The impact on grade inflation will be as the First Minister herself forecast last week ldquoincredible. A % increase in Highers grades means that this years students will forever be marked out as the year when exam credibility went out the window.Whoever called the process by which the Scottish Qualication Authority adjusts exam scores to reflect past school performance ldquomoderation had a dry sense of humour. It has caused fury amongst teachers, pupils, parents.The anger shows no sign of moderating even after Swinneys desperate attempt to put a lid on the worst exam crisis in  years. This was a statement that was as humiliating as it was self-contradictory.:UK falls into recession after lockdown sees record contractionHe began by explaining atwhy the moderation applied by the SQA did not disproportionately downgrade students from deprived areas, as has been widely claimed. This is because the grade inflation, against historic standards, was higher in schools in these areas, at %, than in schools in more prosperous areas, which inflated by only around %. Greater moderation was therefore applied out of fairness, not classism.He then commended the SQAs ldquoopen and transparent adjustment methodology and insisted that it was ldquoin use throughout the UK and across the world\". But, er, not in Scotland any more. Mr Swinney then let the algorithmic cat out of the bag by pointing out that exam moderation happens every year to some extent as the SQA, and its English equivalent Ofqual, manipulate grade boundaries. But not presumably in future.He even announced, solemnly, that the remit of the SQAwas to ensure that every student got ldquothe qualications they deserved. The teacher estimates: ldquo awarded without moderation, he said ldquo would have led to an increase in pass rates without precedent.Sothe methodology was so fair and robust, why was he over-ruling the independent SQA and allowing this unprecedented grade inflation to take place  Well, Mr Swinney had spoken to young people who felt ldquotheir future was being determined by statistical modelling. The credibility of exam grades was of secondary importance to ldquothe risk that people would lose faith in the system. Well, they certainly will now.But does anyone seriously think that the SQA actually marked down working class students because they were living in a deprived postcode  Of course not. The SQA anyway subjected its moderation regime to an Equalities Impact Assessment ndash as it is obliged to do ndash before it published them.Moderation by algorithm is a pretty blunt instrument and doesnt take account of inidual performance. But, as Mr Swinney says, it is very widely used. Capitulating to grade inflation of up to % may win political points in the short term, but it will store up big problems for the future.:John Swinneys SQA U-Turn: Seven things you need to knowEvery year, grade boundaries move up and down to ensure fairness and comparable outcomes. Tens of thousands of pupils have their exam results routinely moderated. The English equivalent of the SQA, Ofqual, uses a very similar ldquostandardisation model against which to correct scores which depart from the historical average.Englands pandemic moderation is, according to reports, even greater than ours ndash % of grades have been adjusted downwards from the estimates provided by teachers, against % in Scotland. We wont know the final figures until tomorrowwhen the English A level results are unveiled. But, strangely, there has not been anything like the controversy over moderation that we have seen here.The inconvenient truth is that the Scottish ldquopandemic cohort, as they are already being dubbed, has exchanged one unfairness for another.

While the Scottish Government, which is ultimately responsible for safeguarding public health, has a major role to play, I believe businesses are better placed to make things happen and to do so far more quickly.The best way forward should involve a new approach with business taking the lead to implement greater safety measures with the support of government and other public sector bodies.This will start with business owners and managers stepping up and being more proactive in ensuring they operate within a safer framework to stop the spread of this virus. As well as providing a clean and safe environment for their customers at all times, they will also need to consider implementing other creative measures and better utilising existing technology.We are already seeing a number of examples of this across the globe where businesses are driving forward on-the-ground initiatives to reduce the risk of a further lockdown. Restaurants in Kinsale, in County Cork, Ireland have, for example, begun testing the temperatures of all their customers upon entry. Meanwhile Tourism Portugal has introduced ldquoSafe  Clean certication which enables participating hotels to provide the reassurance they have undertaken the appropriate level of disinfecting and have made hand sanitiser available to guests throughout their stay. Even McDonaldrsquos has gone beyond government guidelines by making the wearing of masks mandatory for all customers entering any of their , US restaurants.While businesses in Aberdeen and throughout Scotland should be taking the lead in bringing new and effective measures to fruition, the support of the Scottish Government will be essential as well as beneficial. Agencies including Scottish Enterprise, where we have made initial representations on this issue, could provide grants and other support measures. This could help many hard-pressed businesses put temperature monitoring devices for both staff and customers as well as other facilities in place at a time when the strain on their finances may otherwise prevent such expenditure. This would put even more pressure on the public purse, but it would be a sensible investmentit prevents the economic carnage that comes from further lockdowns.Nicola Sturgeonrsquos leadership has been solid throughout much of this pandemic. If she is serious about Scotland rebuilding its economy she should require business to take a greater role in proactively preventing the risk of further outbreaks of the pandemic but also provide the appropriate support to enable it to do this.Andrew Montague is CEO of ClearWater Hygiene"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-mark-smith-scotland-finally-something-inglorious-tradition","story":"But could they be a threatened species  The Scottish Governmentrsquos Werritty report on grouse moors last year said that,there wasnrsquot a marked improvement in the populations of birds of prey on grouse moors , then a licensing system should be introduced. We await the Governmentrsquos response. This week Labour also called for the licensing of grouse shooting after a big increase in the illegal killing of birds during the lockdown.But in Scotland, Irsquom afraid, the signs of progress are not good. For a start, the Werritty report was based on the flawed premise that driven grouse shooting can be made acceptable. Werritty was explicitly looking for ways in which grouse moors could continue to be a part of the economy instead of questioning whether Scotlandrsquos countryside should tolerate a business that harms the countryside ndash through the burning of heather, for example.The reportrsquos conclusion on licensing also ended up being rather limp because the group that led the report was ided, which meant the compromise of suggesting a licensing systemthere is no improvement in bird of prey populations. Which gives the Scottish Government a get-out: wersquore waiting, theyrsquoll say, to seetherersquos been an improvement hellip still waiting hellip still waiting. The Government has also shown a lack of urgency in responding to Werritty. It does not look good.There are also serious question marks over whether licensing will work. First off, the people who are illegally killing birds of prey are unlikely to be deterred by a licensing systemtheyrsquore not deterred by the law as it stands Scotland for more than  years.Therersquos also a danger thatan ineffective licensing system will be introduced and then everything will just carry on as normal. I spoke to the conservationist Mark Avery about this recently and his view was that the whole idea of licensing depended on how robust the system was a weak one would pretty much allow the wildle criminals to carry on regardless.Some people in the shooting community feel theyrsquore being unfairly singled out over this. I remember speaking to one guy who runs a training school for gundogs who said he was frustrated that certain ways of killing animals ndash fishing for example ndash were seen as socially acceptable whereas shooting had a stigma attached to it. A farrier also told me that at least shooting enthusiasts are being honest about killing animals ndash townies on the other hand will happily tuck into burgers and fish and chips and yet judge people for shooting birds or deer.In some ways, I can see where the country sports enthusiasts are coming from on that one ndash for most of us, grouse shooting is a weird and distant practice and maybe that makes it easier to support moves to control it. But fishing doesnrsquot involve killing every other species in the water, whereas the ideal grouse moor from the point of view of landowners and gamekeepers is one thatrsquos devoid of any predator, which leads to predator control on a mass scale ndash legal and illegal.That is the key to the problem: a model that is effectively based on the killing of birds of prey. Perhaps licensing can do something to improve it. I hope so. Perhaps the Government will support licensing. I hope for that too. But it may be that it all rests on a simple question. Mark Thomas of the RSPB said this week that most of the bird of prey deaths theyrsquod seen during lockdown were linked in some way to shooting. So the question is: will licensing change the behaviour of those people  Or do we have to go further and ban driven grouse shooting completely Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

These estimates, based on their work during the school year, were then submitted to a Scottish Qualications Authoritymoderation system which downgraded the results — on criteria including the historic performance of the school.This sparked a huge backlash from students and politicians.Orkney Islands Council’s executive director of education, leisure and housing James Wylie said he was “delighted” by Tuesday’s announcement, made by an under-fire education secretary John Swinney.He said: “The signicant and detailed work carried out by teaching staff and school managers was to an incredibly high standard, and I had every confidence in the approach and final outcome presented to the SQA.”The u-turn now means that teacher estimates will be reinstated, and there will be no need for any appeals process.In Orkney, the downgrading of awards totalled .The total number of exam entries at Kirkwall Grammar School was , across National s, Highers and Advance Highers. Out of those,  were downgraded by the SQA.At Stromness Academy, there was a total of  entries, and a reduction of  across National s, Highers and Advanced Highers. In total, around  estimates were raised by the SQA at both schools.With the small numbers at Junior High Schools, there were very few changes made by the SQA up or down on teacher estimates.Mr Swinney, who is now fighting to save his political career, has already conceded that they got it wrong, and said an independent review would take place to look at where lessons can be learned.The SQA will now reissue grades, based solely on teacher judgement. UCAS and other admission bodies will be informed of the new grades as soon as practical to allow for applications to college and university to be progressed.The headteachers of Stromness Academy and Kirkwall Grammar School, Jane Partridge and Don Hawkins both said they had full confidence in their teachers’ judgements to produce “well-considered” estimates.Mr Hawkins added: “The staff have gone above and beyond to ensure a considered and moderated set of results.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

The rest were reduced by a single grade and she has missed out on As in English, Biology and Modern Studies, as well as a C in Higher Chemistry.Eva said to have her grades knocked down so signicantly has made her “completely reconsider her career path”.Exams were cancelled this year because of Covid- and replaced with estimated grades based on past attainment, and the school’s previous exam record.The modelling system adapted by the Scottish Qualications Authority reduced the grades of around , results, with analysis suggesting youngsters from poorer backgrounds and historically poorer performing schools suffered disproportionately.In her letter, shared almost , times on Twitter, Eva said that “it was clear” that her grades had been signicantly adjusted “because I go to a school classed as underperforming”.Her letter calls for the system, which she describes as discriminatory, to be urgently investigated, adding: “The government has been pushing the ‘no wrong path slogan’ but why should pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds and deprived areas be forced into a pathway they didn’t want and worked tirelessly to avoid”.Eva had been predicted in her fourth year to achieve  As and two Cs at national five level, but in her exams she improved to come out with five As and a B.She added that her school’s recent performance had been affected by staff shortages.She had stayed behind after school for extra tuition, aiming to secure a university place and a career in the field of medicine.“Any further efforts by pupils to achieve higher grades in schools which have historically underperformed has been disregarded, she added.“SQA results this year have been more about fitting the statistical trends than the inidual pupil.”According to the Scottish Government#s own statistics, the estimated . per cent of most deprived pupils who would have expected an A-C band at Higher was lowered to . per cent by the SQA#s moderation system.

Both creations have been made by the hands of very talented local Cullybackey people.Shellinghill Park in Cullybackey has for some time been the focus of the ‘CCP In Bloom’ team. Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges. It was a big undertaking but I enjoyed the experience,”he said.  Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis. They are all made by people living in and around the Cullybackey area and each have their unique style.  This display can be seen in the Maine Business Centre window . The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing! The colour and vibrancy has helped to lighten the mood of everybody in the village and those travelling through it.When in the area look out for the horse and all the displays andyou want to learn more about the work of the Cullybackey Community Partnership, ring Joanne on .

After the devastation caused by the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, , British and Commonwealth troops were posted to Japan to help support the US occupation and reconstruction effort.Among them was Tom Clarke from Ballymena and his daughter Sandra gave theaccess to her collection of photographs of her father and spoke about his memories to mark this sombre anniversary.Sandra, who lives in the village of Lundin Links on the coast of Fe, still keeps in contact with her old friends locally via social media.“Dad was born to Joseph and Jeannie Clarke nee woodcock at Clonavon Place. “He must have been a character in his earky years because he ran away to Belfast at  to try and join the RAF, but he said they gave him a good kick in the backside and and sent him home,” laughs Sandra.SELECTIONEventually Tom met the selection criteria and joined the RAF, subsequently being posted as groundcrew to the Far East where he served in Burma, India and Japan. “My dad was fiercely, proud of his time in RAF. He valued the comradeship and the friends he made during times of hardship far away from home. “I suppose that’s why he took so much interest in the Burma Star Association in later years. He could talk with people who’d been out in the South East Asia theatre and who had experienced similar things.”When Tom was quizzed by his prooud daughter about his role in the war he often preferred to joke about his experiences.“I asked my dad how many planes he had shot down but I remember him saying the closest he got to flying, was laying in bottom of flat bellied boat going into Hong Kong harbour! “Lots of servicemen ended up with bad illnesses out in the Far East and Dad was no exception.“I remember him telling me how he suddenly took sick in the street. He had to throw up and it was then that his  teeth came out and fell into the stream of filthy water which was running down the alley.“He had to chase after them and give them a rinse off - he was never going to get replacments in India during the war!” But it was in the immediate aftermath of the conflict that Tom became one of a very small number of British servicemen to be posted to the Japanese mainland to help with the clean-up of the devastated cities.With the prospect of terrible losses in any military invasion of Japan, the decision had been taken to unleash the Atomic Bombs in a bid to force the Japanese into surrender. The United States detonated two nuclear weapons over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August  and , , respectively, with the consent of the United Kingdom. The two bombings killed between , and , people and remain the only uses of nuclear weapons in armed conflict.Tom received a medal for working in the zones but rarely talked about the more distressing experiences. “He would just say that the whole city had been wiped out. He - and no-one  - had ever seen anthing like it,” says Sandra. “You can only imagine the kind of things he saw.”In later years, Sandra remembers her father’s breathing problems.“My dad was a chronic asthmatic and I remember, after he died, a woman came to see me. They were trying to seethere was any link about ex-servicemen with chest problems and whether it was related to working in areas,that were contaminated after the bomb.“My dad had his normal medals then years later he got the Southeast Asia Medal and I believe he was was the only member in Ireland to hold it“As a wee girl about , I can remember people in the house, were discussing what they would like to inherit.“I wanted my dad’s medals. He was very proud of me taking an interest so he made it his job looking to see any medals he should have had. So he always used to phone me saying I’ve got you another medal - he actually got another  medals,which were commemorative only.”Sandra looked set to follow in her father’s footsteps but her initial attempt ended in failure!“ I asked at  for my dad to sign my papers to join WRAF, but he refused, only for me to join QARANC  years later.” Sandra’s memories of her father also revolve around musicianship.“I asked him one day what would you like to be remembered for and he said his love of music. “He played the trumpet all his le and was in the Silver Band with his brothers Joe and James and their cousins the Woodcocks.“He had a little dance band in the early s ,I remember them playing in the green hut down Harryville Park.”Footnote: Japan surrendered to the Allies on August , six days after the Soviet Unions declaration of war and the bombing of Nagasaki. The Japanese government signed the instrument of surrender on September  in Tokyo Bay, which effectively ended World War II.

These have been in the following council areas: Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council , Ards and North Down Borough Council , Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council , Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council , Mid and East Antrim Borough Council , and Newry, Mourne and Down District Council .In addition, there have been  clusters across Northern Ireland with fewer than five people.These figures are up to pm on th August . Cases in a smaller cluster may also be associated with a larger cluster, for example a common geographic location or common social setting.The PHA will be publishing cluster data on a weekly basis each Thursday until further notice.A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period.Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings. COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters.The PHA’s Contact Tracing Servicecontinues to engage successfully with the vast majority of identied contacts and provide appropriate advice to help prevent any onward spread.Over the week up to pm on th August , the number of positive tests reported to the CTS was  – the number of positive cases requiring contact tracing was . There were  positive cases that completed contact tracing, and  contacts identied. There were  contacts successfully contacted and advised. [see Notes to Editors for further explanation of these figures]Since July, the average number of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing.Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe.“Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app.“This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts.“Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters.Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings.“Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner.Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful.“We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.”Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible. For further information on the virus, its symptoms and how to book a test, visit www.pha.site coronavirusWe must be aware that COVID- is still a threat and we need everyone to play their part in helping to stop the virus spreading.If you receive a positive test result you will be contacted by the PHA’s Contact Tracing Service from .Members of the public are also encouraged to download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app on Android or Apple, which complements the work of the Contact Tracing Service.

In a statement Mr Weir said his aim has always been to support a full timeto classrooms for all pupils where appropriate.“This latest guidance takes into account the Executive’s agreement of August  that the requirement for strict social distancing between children may be relaxed in the presence of other mitigations,” Mr Weir said.“In many ways, it reinforces practices we have all become accustomed to, promoting regular hygiene practices on arrival at schools and throughout the school day, and the application of the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ principles.”He added that the current social distancing guidance of two metres must be followed between adults in the education sector.Read More Belfast Royal Academy tells pupils they must wear masks Teachers# union urges NI schools to make face coverings compulsoryThe guidance is part of the Restart Programme, which was developed by the Department of Education, school leaders and key partners.Engagement with managing authorities, trade unions and sectoral support bodies has also been in place since March and will continue.Minister Weir continued: “I have at all times recognised the stresses felt by teachers, parents and pupils due to the ongoing disruption and uncertainty regarding the future. “That is why I would urge all in our society to continue to play their part in addressing the challenges posed by Covid-.”This includes keeping students away from schools with any Covid- symptoms including a high temperature, persistent cough or a loss of smell or tasteMinister Weir said that in circumstances where strict social distancing is not possible, measures like the use of “protective bubbles,” decreased interaction and movement around schools must be followed.He said this flexible approach had been a success in other countries and would allow the maximum opportunity for face-to-face teaching, but that the advice would remain “agile” to reflect public health advice.Dr Patrick Roach, NASUWT’s General Secretary, commented: “It is entirely unfair and unrealistic to expect schools to be able to respond effectively to this guidance with just one week before they are due to open fully to all students.“Given the commitment to reopen schools fully for the start of the autumn term, Ministers must now commit the resources that will be needed to enable schools to implement the guidance and to reopen safely.” He added that employers must ensure that the health and safety of pupils and staff remained “paramount”.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseNASUWT’s Justin McCamphill FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappNASUWT’s Justin McCamphillJustin McCamphill, NASUWT National Official for Northern Ireland, said: “It is now abundantly clear that ing without the guarantee of social distancing will increase workload burdens for school principals and teachers.

But no — approximately % of Year  A-level pupils had A-levels downgraded with the CCEA Exam Board. The picture with other exam boards was better than this, down slightly. It was with a heavy heart that I awoke this morning to release grades and speak to pupils and parents.Normally I take delight chatting with pupils and parents on results day and congratulating them, but not this year.I was consoling them and offering a shoulder to cry on and a possible hope of an appeal to help their well-being and mental health, with the knowledge that this could take weeks and months to sort out —ever.In all my years as principal I have never had to deal with so many upset pupils and parents as this year.I understand this is a very dficult process to estimate A-level and GCSE grades with the Covid- outbreak.But why ask teachers to spend days and weeks examining past pupil work, holding standardisation meetings online and socially distanced in school and entering marks for the majority of the teacher predictions to be downgraded as we did in our school and most schools across Northern Ireland It is not all doom and gloom - the vast majority of our pupils have got their first preference course at university, which is good, our three A*-C pass rate is up on last year. But what we have discovered is that it is the high performing pupils’ grades that have been downgraded most and that Northern Ireland CCEA exams have been downgraded more than any English exam board. Pupils are saying “you know me Sir or Miss – I am much better than these grades. Look at my exams in school, my coursework, my GCSE results”.

The new centre will be moved a short distance to Anderson House at Altnagelvin. Derry was the first city to set-up a COVID centre back on March  at the out-of-hours Western Urgent Care building. The other Covid centre in the Western Trust area opened at South West Acute Hospital on March . The Trust continues to maintain a state of readiness for admissions of patients with suspected Covid- and a further surge. Speaking at the Western Trust’s monthly board meeting, Dr Anne Kilgallen, Chief Executive, said: “Both centres continue to operate, preparing for a potential second surge. googletag.cmd.push “The Altnagelvin centre will move to Anderson and South West centre will reduce its footprint to free up space in the outpatient department. “Movements are allowing us to recommence our outpatient services.” Antibody testing has been offered in the Trust area as of July , she told the Western Trust board. These tests are used to detect antibodies to the COVID- virus to seeyou have previously had the virus. The test works by taking a blood sample and testing for the presence of antibodies to seeyou have developed an immune response to the virus. A total of  tests were carried out and only  ed as positive, which Dr Kilgallen described as an ‘interesting find’. googletag.cmd.push A Covid swab testing service available to staff, patients pre-operatively and staff in the independent sector continues to operate at C-TRIC at Altnagelvin Hospital and Lackaboy in Enniskillen. However, those services are also relocating in August as part of reset plans. The latest NISRA statistics show that  people have died of Covid- in Derry City and Strabane. In the council area there have been  confirmed coronavirus cases –  in the last  days. In response to the Coronavirus pandemic a network of new Primary CareCovid- centres were then rapidly established to manage the growth of Coronavirus cases in the community. They were seen as an essential part of the fight against this virus.  To ensure vital GP services can be maintained, it is believed to be absolutely critical that those who show symptoms are separated from the patients with nonCovid- related conditions.  These centres are not testing facilities and are only for patients who are very unwell, are suspected of havingCovid- and require medical attention.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The start of the summer. A time of hope. A time of new beginnings. To celebrate my th birthday, my friends and I had travelled to Belfast on a minibus on a school-night in the middle of A Levels for that momentous YES concert. We were thrilled to get to see Ash and Bono at the Waterfront. We were extra ebullient at the sight of John Hume taking to the stage. The unlikely trio of David Trimble, John and Bono were applauded with yells of “Yesss!”. googletag.cmd.push  The burning pride deep inside on that night could have set the world alight. To the friends I had yet to meet, some of whom were at that concert, I would always be Proud Mary from Derry. I had come of age just in time to vote in the referendum three days later. Not all of us would have that privilege. My sister, Deirdre, who was singing and shouting her heart out for the entire excursion, was  months shy of voting age. In fact she would never get to vote as she was killed in a car accident we were involved in  months later. googletag.cmd.push I had meticulously studied the Good Friday Agreement text during the referendum campaign. As excited as I was to be on my way to Loch an Iuacuteir for Cuacutersa na Casca that Good Friday, my inner political nerd was sorry to be missing all the TV and radio coverage. No mobile phones or social media in those days. Just two days before the signing of the Agreement, I was at Stormont with a delegation of Derry Girls lobbying the British Government for a new school. I was on The Thornhill Talks Team with Mrs Boyle, Miss Hamilton and Head Girl, and my lelong friend, Emmylou. The eyes of the world were on these negotiations and the hand of history was on our shoulders. John Hume took time out to facilitate the meeting withMinister of Education, Tony Worthington MP. John was the architect of the unfolding momentous peace accord, but he was focussed on bread and butter constituency issues. He knew the importance of education in creating opportunities and building inclusive and peaceful communities. I was engaged in current affairs and local politics from a young age. I was fascinated by the work of my godfather, Uncle Mark. His job as John Hume’s parliamentary aide brought him to ious countries. He gted me with great stories and good lessons over the years. I proudly flaunted a “Hume for Europe” Tshirt in . I read newspapers. I listened intently to the kitchen wireless and followed the TV debates. Always rooting for John and rehearsing the Humespeak: You can’t eat a flag. Spill sweat, not blood. Respect ersity. An accident of birth. Dference is the essence of humanity. This language is now common parlance. John brought others on to his page and round to his way of thinking and speaking. It is impossible to consider John’s achievements without recognising the influence of his we and key adviser, Pat. On completion of my A Levels, I had the pleasure of working in the Bayview Terrace constituency office in the run up to the first Assembly elections. I learned so much about public service, not least in witnessing the compassion and care shown by Pat to every person. The office was buzzing. Phone calls were coming in from journalists, humanitarians and politicians from all over the world. I could hear John speaking in French on the phone one minute, then dealing with a constituent on a housing issue the next minute. Pat had time and warmth for everyone. Amidst the flurry, Pat still found time for banter and indulged my frivolous chats about nights out. I still regard Pat as a mentor and hero. I can only try and imagine the extent of sacrices made by Pat and her family over the years. After that short stint in the office, I spent three months working in Seagate , before starting my chapter at Queen’s and all the adventures that came with that and after that. The Omagh atrocity that summer was a stark reminder of the fragility of the hard-earned peace. John Hume was a political giant, a living legend and an international statesman. Above all, he was a Derry champion. He was a man of global thinking and local action. First-hand experience of poverty in his community motivated his relentless quest for social justice, and his role in founding the credit union movement was instrumental in giving opportunities to people and families. His civic leadership in the community was as impressive as his political leadership on the world stage. John Hume was a man of vision. Steadfast in his ambitions. Resolute in pursuit of solution. Willing to work with anyone. Determined not to be distracted by the viliers. He kept his shoulder to the wheel and his eyes on the prize. Not any of the acclaimed world prizes he won . Ultimately the prize for John was the prize for everyone: peace and the prospect of a brighter future. Those coming of age today face immense challenges as we emerge from a global health pandemic and enter a world recession. Climate emergency is real. In this part of the world we face the added challenges of Brexit uncertainty. Today’s generation need an injection of the hope that my generation were given  years ago. We still have much work to do. The “isolation of the West” remains a pertinent issue. The fight for a proper university presence in the city continues. “I sometimes wish it was that summer again…..” We should always maintain a little bit of that summer, even in the middle of the longest winters. The spirit of partnership and reconciliation underpinning the Good Friday Agreement and defining Hume’s pathway must be restored. And we shall overcome.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Entering the school foyer you’re struck that John Hume sits alongside illustrious company in what must have been a golden age of thinkers and creators. A bust made in the Derry man’s honour rests between two gentlemen who excelled in their own fields in Seamus Heaney and Brian Friel.  Each of these men attended the former Bishop Street school around the same time and went on to become giants in their respective disciplines. googletag.cmd.push John Hume’s own journey at the college began in  . “He told his mother he was going to the College and she said, ‘no you’re not, we can’t afford that’, but he passed his Eleven Plus and got in,” current principal Finbar Madden said. Hume was part of the first generation to avail of opportunities through the introduction of the Eleven Plus. It allowed more young people to continue their post-primary education which may go some way to explaining why men like Hume, Friel and Heaney grasped the opportunity with both hands. There was obviously ‘huge talent and ability’, Mr Madden said, as Hume left the school with a scholarship to study at university. googletag.cmd.push He had ambitions of joining the priesthood at the leading Catholic Seminary in Ireland, St Patrick’s College, Maynooth. Hume didn’t complete his clerical studies but instead opted to serve his community in another way. He graduated from the National University of Ireland in  with a bachelor’s degree in French and history and went on to receive a master’s degree. Returning to Derry, Hume would became a teacher at St. Columb’s. Mr Madden said that career lasted from -. At the time, the history curriculum was limited in schools and Hume taught the subject in a broader sense, keen to instil his vision of Ireland’s place in Europe. As he departed, transitioning into a career in politics, some of the key developments in the civil rights movement were starting to unfold. That, however, wasn’t the end of his journey with the school and his legacy endures. The colleges former pupils association present an annual award - the Alumnus Illustrissimus Award - to a past-pupil who has achieved something of major signicance or has made a considerable contribution in his own field. In , the Most Reverend Dr Edward Daly received the inaugural award and the following year John Hume would be recognised for his contribution to politics and peace in Northern Ireland. Mr Madden said: “The school is able to boast of many exceptional students who went out and made their mark locally, nationally and internationally. “The award recognises achievement whatever the field may be sport, science politics, religion and so on.” A proud College boy, Hume maintained connections over the years and wouldfor prize giving ceremonies. “He presented a facsimile of his Nobel prize to the school,” Mr Madden pointed out next to the assembly hall, “and our politics A-level prize is the John Hume prize in government and politics.” “And for as long as he could, he would come every year to prize-giving, he usually turned up unannounced but we always expected him to come, until unfortunately he wasn’t able to. “He had a very, very clear sense of his connectedness with this school and he never lost that right throughout his le. “In a way that many others weren’t able to do, by his connectedness here, by his presence, he was making it clear that St. Columb’s College meant a huge amount to him. “He recognised what the college had helped him to become.” The school’s principal believes that pupils have looked up to Hume over the years and used him as a source of inspiration in their own studies. Mr Madden concluded: “I think Colum Eastwood said it last night, John Hume was Ireland’s Martin Luther King and we recognise that Martin Luther King had a dream and did all he could to achieve it. “I think John Hume did exactly the same thing here.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The club have never tasted adult championship success. With the manner of victory over Glenullin on Sunday afternoon, it would suggest that consistency will be what Eamon Gibson will be looking from his squad during this condensed season. It leaves John Heaneys side with some soul-searching ahead of their clash with Limavady this weekend. From the way Ben McCarron careered through the Glenullin defence in the opening seconds, until the final whistle, they never looked like being reeled in. If anything, they shouldve won by more. If they are to stand up and be counted when the serious heat comes on, they will need a more ruthless streak in front of goal. The pleasing thing for them, they appear to have the raw materials. googletag.cmd.push They will have to take somewhat of a reality check. Glenullin didnt offer the threat many expected and showed signs of the form that found them in relegation trouble last year. It was a big ask for Michael Oacuteg McKeown in his first game in goals to replace the injured Pearse McNicholl and when they failed to secure possession at midfield, it was a long hour for him. Steelstowns runners through the middle hurt them and with Ben McCarron playing as a third midfielder, their mobile attack thrived in the space. Dermot OKane, one the best dead ball kickers in the county, was off colour and Eoin Bradleys relaxed  metre free coming off the post summed up a day they will want to forget. googletag.cmd.push Stephen Cleary played in the reserve game, but was forced off injured and  minutes into the senior game Eoghan Bradleys ankle injury saw him replaced. On came Rory Maguire who had while he had a terric game, he will be disappointed not to have bagged three further goals. Cahir McMonagle will be another option in attack, but its hard to imagine him getting the room he was afforded yesterday when the real action comes to town. Glenullin put Conor Rafferty onto Neil Forester in what seemed like a curtaining job, while Feargal Close pushed back on to Gareth Logue. It was Logie who dictated the game and even when Gerard OKane was sent out to mark him, the Steelstown mans movement caused Glenullin trouble. Steelstown were three points ahead when the first goal chance presented itself, but it fell to Glenullin. Dermot OKane picked out Paul Rafferty in front of goal but the low pile-driver was instinctively turned onto the bar by goalkeeper Marty Dunne. Seconds later Jacob Duffy had the ball over the bar at the other end. Brothers Dermot and Gerard OKane kicked two terric point, but it did little to stem Steelstowns incessant running game. Whoever is going to stop them, cant afford to drop off. They will need a half-forward line that will occupy them and top the overlap. When the first goal came, it was a majestic diagonal ball from full-back Shane OConnor who found Logue in space and his unstoppable shot went to the bottom corner of McKeowns net. Ryan Devine floated over a fine score from distance before Jacob Duffy made the second goal, with the strong-running Maguire blasting to the net. Steelstown missed three point chances before Maguire was blown up for over carrying when through on goal, almost ashe was caught in two minds to flick to the final support runner. Glenullin brought on three substitutes at the break. Brian Mullan was pulled out from goal with Eoin Bradley now stationed at full-forward. Early in the second-half he won a free but somehow spurned it from close range. He missed a chance in front of goal and the attacking unit didnt have the movement that would have tested Steelstown. At times Brian Mullan, who kept trying to push Glenullin forward, tried to float balls forward. The dference being was that the same space wasnt there that Gareth Logue made for the city men. The half took seven minutes to produce a first score. The move began with Dunnes monstrous kick over midfield, Rory Maguire was again involved and when the ball came from a Mark Foley, he was brilliantly denied by Eunan OKanes ing block, before Foley drilled over the . Then came a moment Gibson and his assistant Raymond Tracey wont be too happy with. Mark Foley had the ball at his feet in front of goal, with time to engineer a chance. He opted to lazily soccer the ball to Jacob Duffy who missed without working goalkeeper McKeown. On another day, this lack of urgency could be crucial. Ben McCarron and Darren McDaid, from opposite wings, floated over two sweet scores. And still the goal chances kept flooding in. After a neat move, McCarron and Jason McAleer created another opening but Maguires thundering shot hit the bar before spinning over. Maguire also brought out a fine save from goalkeeper McKeown who brilliant clawed the rebound clear, as the Steelstown attacks kept pouring forward. The chances Steelstown were mounting and missing had no bearing on the result. At the other end a fisted Eoin Bradley effort dropped into Dunnes arms and Conor Rafferty fired over when a goal was on, but it was always going to be Steelstowns day.

The fact he was man of the match in a dominant team tells enough about his performance. The finish for his goal combined power and accuracy to the bottom cover. With Ben McCarron playing further out, it was Logues running that made th Steelstown attack tick. MOMENT OF THE GAMEDUNNE SAVE – There were many scores in the game, but Marty Dunnes save was something . Dermot OKanes ball came in from the wing and Paul Rafferty just pulled on it along the ground and when the shot zipped off the turf, Dunne somehow got enough on the ball to prevent a goal that wouldve levelled the game in the thminute. TURNING POINTQUICK POINTS – While the first half goals gave Steelstown a , having Eoin Bradley lurking at full-forward meant they could not rest easy at the back. There were seven points between the teams with  minutes gone, but in the next five minutes Foley, McCarron, McDaid and McMonagle chipped in with scores to kill off the game.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Lisa McGee was doing her A-Levels at Thornhill College when the Good Friday Agreement was signed in , and grew up knowing about Mr Humes work for the peace process. He was just there all the time, she recalled. There wasnt a time that you didnt know about him. There was never any debate about it, he was a good man. At a time where everything was debated about and talked about nobody ever questioned that. Not that you would ever have needed to, or have wanted to, question what he was doing. googletag.cmd.push Ms McGee said the news of Mr Humes death on Monday morning came as a shock, despite knowing that he had been ill for some time. He was a hero who walked among us, she said. I got really upset I was surprised at how emotional I felt. We were just so used to having him. It was phenomenal what he did, the influence he had and the amazing vision of what our future should be. Ms McGee believes hundreds of people owe their le to Mr Hume, due to his role in the cessation of violence. He was an incredible person and he was sent here for a reason, she said. googletag.cmd.push I was just thinking yesterday of all the people that may not be herehe hadnt been able to do what he did and built the peace process. When you think of everything he did and he never gave up- thank God. Ms McGee doesnt knowJohn Hume ever watched Derry Girls, but she hopes he would have approved. I dont knowhe ever saw it, but he and Pat knew I was a big fan, she said. I hope they thought it was alright. He was always in the background in the news, so he was present in the show. And Erin chats about him a lot in the Derry Girls book that I did recently. There would be no Derry Girls without John Hume because I wouldnt have had the opportunities that I had,” she added. The Derry writer that she wants her two young children to learn about John Hume as they grow up. There was an amazing image of him on the front of thetoday [Tuesday] and I want to get that framed for the house because its important that they know about him, she said. This was always going to be a very sad time because it was always going to be about looking back over the past and that was a very painful time in our history. It has been a sad thing for me that towards the end of his le he couldnt remember everything he achieved. Thats why we have to remember for him.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The new vaccine research registrywill help large numbers of people to be recruited into trials over the coming months, potentially leading to an effective vaccine being identied and made available to the UK public against coronavirus sooner. It has been developed as part of the UK Government’s Vaccine Taskforce, in partnership with the National Institute for Health Research , NHS Digital, and the Northern Ireland, Scottish and Welsh Governments. Dr Janice Bailie, Assistant Director, RD Division, Public Health Agency, said: “Health researchers are currently working to find a vaccine for COVID-, but without the help of members of the general public willing to participate in vaccine trials, this work will not be able to succeed. googletag.cmd.push “The NHS COVID- vaccine registry allows people to register their interest and be potentially contacted with an offer to participate in clinical studies. “You can sign up to give permission for researchers to contact you about taking part in COVID- vaccine studies. By collecting details about people who are interested in taking part in vaccine studies, the registry service will help cut down the time it takes to find volunteers for vaccine studies. This will help us to carry out studies and find a vaccine faster.” The registry is available to anyone aged  or over, living in the UK. To register, people fill in some personal and contact details, and answer a series of basic health screening questions on an NHS web form atwww.nhs.uk researchcontact. googletag.cmd.push   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Cllr McGurk added: “This program aims to help local families reduce the cost of purchasing unorms. “However, we are relying on the generosity of the local community to donate items of unorm which are in good condition and are no longer needed by their own family. “We would appeal to all families whose children have moved out of school, or outgrown items of unorm, to donate to the program at any on the drop off points advertised in social media.” googletag.cmd.push Once items are received and sorted, families will have an opportunity to book an appointment to pick up items they need at Benbradagh Community Support or Hands That Talk.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dan McGrellis passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by his family and friends. He was a well-known and much-loved member of the community, parish and local GAA club. At his funeral, Fr McGavigan paid tribute to a ‘good father, grandfather and great grandfather’. “Dan was a remarkable man.

Dan was chairperson of St Mary’s GAC, Banagher from  to , having been vice chairperson in  and . As well as his involvement with the GAA, Fr McGavigan told the congregation that Dan contributed greatly to parish and community le in Banagher. “Parish and community were central to his le,” he said. “He lobbied the council for a footpath from Feeny village to the chapel, ensuring access for the local primary school, and was an early member of Feeny Community Association. “Helping to establish the parish bingo, he was involved in the renovation of the parish hall and ably served for many years as a sacristan in this church.”  Dan’s most loyal commitment, though, was to his family and his we Anne. Fr McGavigan told mourners how the couple encountered each other long before they were married. “The story is told of how he, as a young boy, watched a christening pass his mother’s shop on the way to the chapel,” he said. “The baby was a certain Anne Conway, who was brought here to be christened. “He recalled how he wasn’t much interested in a baby at eight years old, but recounted how a neighbour remarked, ‘this could be the girl you marry’. “Years later, they met again at a dance in Aghabrack and they soon married and settled down to begin a family. So began the McGrellis dynasty. “Dan and Anne patiently, generously and faithfully raised their twelve children, instilling in them their own virtues of hard work, kindness, generosity, respect and good humour.” Fr McGavigan concluded by encouraging Dan’s many children, grandchildren and great grandchildren to be inspired by his le. “Dan was a powerhouse of prayer and work and an inspiration for all of the McGrellis family,” he said “To his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren be inspired today by the holy le and death of a good man, and see in his le the virtues you would like to see in your own. “If you do this, Dan will live on in you and future generations. Woven into your sadness, there is a deep gratitude to God for all that this man has been to us. “We are happy, because we know deep down that his le was complete and that he, in the end, was ready for God.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Along with drivers of internal combustion enginecars using EV charge points as makesht parking bays, EV drivers listed poor maintenance of the existing network as a major problem. Phil Gordon, a Donegal resident who works at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, said the majority of the city’s charge points are not ing. “It’s been slowly falling apart for years and nobody is doing anything about it. It was developed around -,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I got my EV in  and at that point, in Derry alone there were seven standard chargers and one rapid. At the minute there are only two of the slow chargers left working. “There one on Carlisle Road has been broken for as long as I can remember. There is one in the Diamond that has been out of order for about  or  months. “We’ve been told by eCars that it’s beyond repair, they can’t fix it and there is no plan to replace it. The north west in general has been very badly served by eCars for a long time. googletag.cmd.push “You look at how many there are in Belfast. It’s the biggest city and it has four or five rapid chargers. Derry is the second biggest city in the country and it’s only ever had one.” A map showing EV charge points across County Derry. Responsibility for the network across the island of Ireland lies with eCars, a specic section of Electricity Supply Board . The company began charging last year for the use of its rapid chargers in the Republic of Ireland and further pricing for standard network charging points came into effect yesterday. ESB have said they hope to be able to replace broken chargers, but that ‘planning issues’ are causing a delay. “In County Derry, there are  chargers in total each with two charge points. Of these  are working correctly and our systems indicate recent usage,” a spokesperson said. “There are, however, a number of chargers in Derry City which have faults which cannot be resolved, and new chargers are required. “This is due to the age of the equipment and that they are no longer supported by the original charger manufacturer. “In addition, one charger was removed at the train station due to building works and which is due to be reinstated in coming months by the building contractor. “ESB ecars has plans to replace a section of the existing Standard AC network in Northern Ireland including in Derry. “There are a number of planning issues which need to be resolved first and work is on-going with relevant stakeholders in relation to it at present. “It is hoped that these issues can be overcome with a view to beginning to replace chargers in the coming months.” At present, it is free to charge an electric car using the Northern Ireland network, something EV driver Ronan McElholm feels leaves the system open to abuse. “They’re free, and this is half the problem. When you get something that is free, it’s subject to abuse,” he said. “There is a lot of funding from the government in the Republic, but added to that is the fact you’re now having to pay for it and it makes things easier. “It’s not a fortune to charge your car. It’s only slightly more than the day-time rate. It keeps the freeloaders away because it’s now cheaper to charge at home than on the network.” While the lack of maintenance on the network has caused problems, EV drivers are also having to contend with ICE drivers using the charge points as parking bays. “A lot of places, they’ll put a charger in but don’t enforce the parking, so people park an ordinary car in it because it’s a handy space and they leave it there,” said Phil Gordon “There is no punishment for that. In Derry City, you will get a ticketyou’re parked in an EV charging bay, but a in lot of places, that’s not enforced. “It’s ridiculous. They call it ‘ICE-ing’. Internal Combustion Engine. If they’ve parked an ordinary car in your place, you’ve been ‘iced’. It’s such a common problem there’s a term for it. “You wouldn’t park a car at a petrol pump and walk off and leave it. That’s the equivalent.” Ronan McElholm regularly travels from Derry to Belfast and Dublin for work, and has encountered the problem on numerous occasions. “It causes a problem. I was going to Belfast, finding an abandoned car on a charger with no way of knowing when this person is coming back,” he said. “I’ve never had any issues with the rapid charger on the Glenshane, for example, apart from non-electric cars parking in it. One day there was a van parked and left there for three hours. “Once you hit five o’clock, non-electric cars just park in it, which is an incredibly selfish thing for anyone to do. “They can get a ticket for it, but once the traffic wardens go home, there is no one to ticket you, because the police say it’s not their responsibility. “In the Republic, they are upgrading all the street chargers to rapid chargers, which is a good thing, but unless there is proper policing on it, people just pull in and park. “It needs a change to legislation and the police need powers to ticket cars parked on them.” DfI Minister Nichola Mallon arriving for work in her EV. The political lag caused by Stormont’s two-year period of stalemate has resulted in a backlog across all departments which has delayed any upgrade to the EV charging network. Department for InfrastructureMinister Nichola Mallon raised eyebrows when she arrived in an EV on the day Stormont ed in January. “That was a show.

The poll, conducted before the NI Executive’s decision to make the wearing of face coverings compulsory from yesterday, indicated that .% would be in favour of the move. When askedthey would comply with a ruling to make face coverings in shops compulsory, the amount of positive responses increased to .%. % of respondents who listed Maghera as their nearest town or village indicated they would not complythe wearing of face coverings was made compulsory. googletag.cmd.push The survey also found that a large majority of residents in the county are already in possession of a face covering. .% of respondents indicated that they had either bought or been given a face covering since the beginning of the Covid- pandemic. Of that number, the most popular setting for wearing a face covering was the supermarket, with % of respondents indicating they had worn their covering there. Petrol stations and local shops were the next highest on .%, with hairdressers, barbers and beauty salons close behind on .%.  Just % said they had worn a covering on public transport, where they have been compulsory since July , while .% of those who took part in the survey said they never wore one. googletag.cmd.push Asked to comment on face coverings, many of those opposed to wearing one said they didn’t feel it would have any impact on the spread of the virus. One respondent said: “I really dont think they are necessary. Wearing them is not effective. Hand washing  social distancing are the best preventative measures. Others felt the issue should be a matter of personal choice, with one respondent stating, ‘it should be a choice, not an order’. “If it’s not safe enough to go out without a face mask then its not safe enough to go out period. The number of people with ill-fitting masks is unbelievable,” said another. “Gaping holes, noses uncovered, constantly adjusting them with their hands are all defeating the purpose of the masks.”  Protecting the vulnerable was a motivator for many of those who were in favour of mandatory face coverings. “We should protect each other as best we can. Currently the advice is that face masks help prevent the spread of Covid-, so take responsibility and wear one,” said one respondent. Some also felt that coverings should have been mandatory since the start of lockdown, while others who are shielding said the lack of face coverings makes them anxious. “I dont see enough people wearing them coming out of shielding myself,” said one respondent. “I feel really unsafe and anxious about going into enclosed places as it is with my mask on so when people are not wearing them it concerns me and my safety.” As the requirement came into force yesterday, the NI Executive launched their ‘Wear One For Everyone’ campaign, stressing the move was to make things safer for everyone.  A joint statement said: “The use of face coverings is a vital defence in our battle against Covid-. “This is about looking after each other and doing everything we can to stay on top of this virus. It will help to save lives. “It also has to be remembered that some people cannot wear face coverings, due to a disability or health condition. “There should be no stigma attached to anyone in these circumstances. If those of us who can cover up do so, then it will help keep everyone safe. “We are confident most people will comply, but those who do not wear a face covering without a reasonable excuse risk being issued with a fixed penalty notice by the police.” Mid Ulster MLA, Emma Sheerin, said making face coverings mandatory was a positive step. “I welcome the move to make face coverings mandatory, and I think that we all should be doing whatever we can to minimise risks to ourselves and others,” she added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

To date, that remains the only such cluster in the Causeway Coast and Glens area identied since contact tracing began on May , which is one of eleven identied across Northern Ireland. A Public Health Agencystatement revealed that Newry, Mourne and Down District Councilhad the highest number of identied clusters, while Mid and East Antrimis next highest. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council,Ards and North Down Borough Council andArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council all have one identied cluster of over five people. googletag.cmd.push There have been no large clusters identied in the Derry City and Strabane or Mid Ulster districts, that cover the remainder of County Derry. However, the PHA have also said they have identied  smaller clusters, of less than five people, across Northern Ireland, and said they would continue to publish data each Thursday. A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period. Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings.  googletag.cmd.push COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters. Since July, the averagenumber of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The PHA say the rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing. Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe. “Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app. “This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts. “Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters. Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings. “Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful. “We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.” Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible.

To date, that remains the only such cluster in the Causeway Coast and Glens area identied since contact tracing began on May , which is one of eleven identied across Northern Ireland. A Public Health Agencystatement revealed that Newry, Mourne and Down District Councilhad the highest number of identied clusters, while Mid and East Antrimis next highest. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council,Ards and North Down Borough Council andArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council all have one identied cluster of over five people. googletag.cmd.push There have been no large clusters identied in the Derry City and Strabane or Mid Ulster districts, that cover the remainder of County Derry. However, the PHA have also said they have identied  smaller clusters, of less than five people, across Northern Ireland, and said they would continue to publish data each Thursday. A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period. Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings.  googletag.cmd.push COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters. Since July, the averagenumber of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The PHA say the rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing. Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe. “Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app. “This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts. “Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters. Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings. “Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful. “We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.” Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible.

The Latvian event is the first loose surface event of the ERC season and despite fluctuating travel restrictions around Europe, the event has attracted a strong entry and Devine will start the event at number  in the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy entered Hyundai i R. Despite limited loose surface experience in the  wheel drive Hyundai, Devine and co-driver Brian Hoy are looking forward to seeing what they can do in Latvia. googletag.cmd.push “Obviously Italy was a disappointment but thankfully the car has been repaired. I need to put that behind me now”, Devine said. “I’ve only had a little bit of loose surface experience with the Hyundai so at the moment my preparation has been about watching onboards but we have the official test ahead of the event which will be a help. It’s going to be a bit of a challenge but we knew from the start of the year this would be the toughest event, just because it’s something we are not used to. Myself and Brian both did Finland a few years ago as part of the Junior World Rally Championship and it wouldn’t be too dissimilar, but that was in an R car, an R car is so much faster! From what I’ve seen the rally looks really good and the stages look nice but it’s a place where you wouldn’t want to get it wrong because it’s so high speed. googletag.cmd.push A lot of the guys will be quite used to it having done it before andyou are not on it from the beginning, you can get left behind very quickly. But we have to start somewhere, that’s how we are looking at it this year. I also have to remember that I need points on the board.” Devine’s involvement with the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy and Hyundai’s Customer Racing Junior Driver programs also saw him take in Rally di Alba recently. “It was great to get out straight after the disappointment of Rome and especially on such a star studded event. It was also interesting to run with a new team for that weekend which was a great experience and I’m very thankful to Hyundai Motorsport Customer Racing for setting it up, he added. Callum and Brian will be partnered in Latvia by  other all Irish crews in Hyundai’s. Craig Breen and Paul Nagle will tackle the event as they continue their development of MRF tyres while Cathan McCourt and James Fulton will join Callum is the PCRS camp. “When you’re abroad, it’s nice to have a few competitors from home around too, it helps you relax a little”, said Callum. Rally Liepāja will begin on Friday, August  with pre-event practice and shakedown before the event properly gets underway on Saturday which will see Callum and Brian tackle  stages before a further  stages on Sunday conclude the event.

Parking restrictions will also be in place around the working areas.Ni Water says the investment is part of a programme of work to improve the existing sewers in Downpatrick, which will enhance the local sewerage infrastructure and reduce the risk of out of sewer flooding.It has confirmed that the essential work will involve repairing existing sewers and will mainly be undertaken using underground trenchless techniques, which will signicantly reduce the duration and disruption of the programme.But NI Water is warning that it will be necessary to undertake lsquoopen-digrsquo repairs at some locations due to the condition of the existing sewers.The organisation says that this particular aspect of the work is expected to last just one or two days with contractors also working in the evening, with every effort being made to minimise disruption.ldquoAppropriate traffic management and signage will be in place as the work progresses, said a NI Water spokeswoman.ldquoThe majority of the works will be undertaken during normal working hours. However, to reduce disruption to businesses and the public, some night-time works will be required at key locations.The work will take place at ious locations around the Downpatrick area, including some of the main streets within the town centre.NI Water has confirmed that the contractor working on the Downpatrick scheme mdash Geda Construction mdash will liaise with any affected businesses and properties.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWe appreciate that this work is disruptive and would like to thank the public in advance for their patience as we complete these essential improvement works.ldquoWe are all practising social distancing and our priority is to keep customers and colleagues safe. Please keep your distance and our workers will carry on with their essential work for you.South Down MLA Colin McGrath has met with NI Water officials ahead of work starting in Downpatrick, highlighting the need for communication with the community and the need to complete the scheme quickly.He said it was imperative that consideration was given to the works being done in the evening and at weekends to ensure that the level of public disruption was kept to as low a level as possible.ldquoI canrsquot think of a time in recent memory when Downpatrick has suffered road works after road works than has happened over the past few years, the MLA continued. ldquoIf the public is frustrated by this, it is entirely understandable and entirely justied.ldquoThe past few months have been incredibly worrying and stressful and people are finally able to step out of their homes. Shielding finally came to a end last week and the most vulnerable in our society are able to take those first tentative steps out of their homes again. It would have been altogether unacceptable for them to have to navigate this with works going on in their town.Mr McGrath said that having raised these issues with NI Water, the organisation is planning to use underground trenchless techniques, with contractors also working in the evening.He added: ldquoI will be in regular contact with the project manager to ensure that these works are completed as quickly as possible and due consideration given to the public.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has appealed to residents and the business community to remain patient as the work progresses.ldquoThis is an important scheme for Downpatrick and, as such, there will inevitably be disruption. NI Water intends to keep this to a minimum and it is important that this is the case, he continued.ldquoThis is a signicant investment in a much-needed scheme to not only upgrade the existing infrastructure, but also prevent so-called out-of-sewer flooding.

The original proposal was to end the scheme on August .Downpatrick councillors Gareth Sharvin mdash who initially proposed the free parking initiative ndash and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the

heartened by the usage, admitting that he did receive some feedback that there were some all-day parkers taking up vital spaces which would have had a negative impact on our local businesses.Agreement to extend the free parking initiative was accepted by the local authority on Monday following a proposal by Cllr Sharvin.ldquoThe near eight weeks of free car parking have been a great benefit to

not hesitate to call on the council to reconsider the car parking charges again,traders feel it is impacting on them signicantly during this continuing pandemic.Cllr Hanlon said while free parking had been extended, it was important that the public remembered that charges would be introduced shortly.However, she expressed disappointment at the lack of signs informing people that parking is free which confused some shoppers.Cllr Hanlon said a number drivers contacted her regarding the issuing of enforcement tickets whilst using the car parks for minor offences.She continued: ldquoThis, in my

to defer a final decision until a site meeting takes place.The planning application for a building capable of housing up to , birds at an established poultry farm at Keel Point in Dundrum, close to the Murlough Nature Reserve, was withdrawn from the schedule at the planning meeting.Planners were recommending that permission should not be granted for a proposal which involved the removal of an existing poultry house and replacing it with a larger one.The National Trust is opposed to the Dundrum proposal, arguing that it would cause ldquounacceptable harm to the fragile environment of the Nature Reserve while the applicant argued that planners appeared to be treating the proposal as a ldquobrand new enterprise and not the replacement of an existing free range poultry unit.While planners were recommending that the Seaforde proposal should not be given the green light, a final decision was deferred to allow the applicant time to provide additional information.Permission is being sought for two poultry houses for almost , chickens at an established Moy Park poultry farm, with the planned development considered necessary in order to facilitate additional bird capacity on-site as part of the companyrsquos expansion programme.Planners say while the addition of two further poultry sheds and ancillary works would not cause ldquounacceptable damage to the rural character of the area, they were recommending that the application should be refused.They argue thatit is allowed to proceed, the proposal would have an ldquounacceptable, adverse impact on the

Its need has been proven. There was no need to explore the feasibility of anything, she said.Mrs Trainor said the outcome of the meeting with health officials was that politicians, the community and trade unions stood together in demanding theof AE provision.She added: ldquoThis very much reminded me of the early days of the hospital campaign where everyone was saying the same thing. We won the case for the Downe but, from day one, administrators started to strip services from it.ldquoOver recent days what has given me the greatest heart has been the reaction of the politicians, the community and trade unions on the Downe Hospital issue.Mrs Trainor said she hopes that the unity will continue, insisting that when it comes to hospital services, the people of Downe are asking for nothing more than parity with those in other areas.ldquoThere has been substantial underfunding in this district for many years and we need parity with everyone  alongside rural proofing as, for those in authority, the centralisation of services is still very much alive. Their attitude is that everything stops in Belfast, she continued.ldquoBut everything does not have to be centralised in the city. The Downe is a beautul hospital but is being totally underused, yet it is one of the most modern of its kind. There is room to expand to increase service provision and we also want more consultants and staff alongside increased investment for student nurses.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoThere is total unity across the community on these issues and a strong defence of the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital is the single biggest issue in our district. There is strength in our unity and togetherness.

Please try again later.Submitting...Catalina over Enniskillen during WWIIDuring the Second World War the people of Fermanagh became well accustomed to the sight and sound of Catalina flying boats operating out of Castle Archdale or Killadeas on anti-U-boat, convoy escort or training sorties. Ironically, prior to being handed over to the RAF, Killadeas had actually been constructed for, and commissioned by, the US Navy, but those plans changed. Catalinas, designed and built in the USA from the mid-s by the Consolidated Aircraft Corporation of San Diego for the US Navy initially, from  were supplied also to the United Kingdom where by the end of the war they had equipped a total of  squadrons of the Royal Air Force, at home and overseas. On Lough Erne, they were used by a total of six squadrons, not all of which were present at the same time.US Navy P- PoseidonAs a patrol bomber the Catalina was an effective machine with one outstanding capability – it could remain airborne for a day or morerequired, albeit at a comparatively slow patrol speed and with reduced war-load of bombs or the more usual depth charges, to conserve fuel. That did not necessarily obviate its effectiveness in the war against the U-boats as the mere presence of an aircraft was enough to compel U-boat commanders to submerge where the ability of their boats to intercept and attack vessels on the surface, which were usually faster, was greatly reduced. However, what it did mean in terms of U-boat sinkings was that Catalinas were not as successful as the Sunderland flying boats also based on the lough or, even more so, land-based aircraft such as the American B- Liberators. The precise circumstances of every U-boat loss will always be open to contention but records based on the latest scientic study would indicate that no U-boats were sunk by Catalinas operating from Lough Erne compared to five by Sunderlands. By comparison,  U-boats were destroyed by Liberators, albeit operating from three airfields in Northern Ireland , of which  were victims of Ballykelly-based Liberators.Nevertheless, two Catalina flying boats operating from Fermanagh, will long be associated with one of the most important early Allied successes in the Battle of the Atlantic – the destruction of the German battleship Bismarck. On May , the exact position of this greatly feared surface raider that was then the object of an extensive and urgent search following her destruction of HMS Hood, was established by Catalina AH ‘Z’ of  Squadron out of Castle Archdale. In command of the Catalina was Pilot Officer Dennis Briggs of the RAF but, signicantly, his co-pilot was a young United States Naval Ensign, Leonard B ‘Tuck’ Smith who was, in diplomatic terms, attached to RAF Coastal Command in an observation role but unofficially to help train RAF aircrew in the piloting of Catalinas as well as gain his own experience of operational flying as the USA was then nominally a neutral country. The Bismarck’s position established, her ‘shadowing’ was continued by a number of aircraft including Catalina AH of  Squadron, Castle Archdale , until her destruction the following day. In August , ironically,  Squadron was transferred to Iceland where it had better luck. On the th of the month, Flying Officer Jewiss and crew suddenly sighted U- on the surface and, in conjunction with the anti-submarine trawler HMS Vascama, sank the submarine with the loss of all hands.On Saturday, August , the th anniversary of VJ-Day, the historic events of early wartime in Fermanagh will be recalled when the US Navy will again make its presence felt over Enniskillen, depending, as always, on weather conditions.This will be in the form of what can be regarded as a ‘modern-day Catalina’, a P- Poseidon maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare aircraft except that it is a landplane, not a flying boat, with most performance capabilities signicantly dferent to the Catalina. A product of the Boeing Aircraft Corporation of Seattle in the US State of Washington, the P- is a military derivative of the Boeing  airliner. With a , nautical miles radius plus four hours on station and  knots top speed capability, it is equipped with state-of-the-art, highly sophisticated navigation, sensory and radar equipment. In a large weapons bay and on external hardpoints it can carry a wide range of armament including torpedoes, cruise missiles, bombs, depth charges and mines. Normally, it requires a crew of nine, similar to the Catalina.In , P- Poseidons entered front-line service with the US Navy which placed orders for more than . Very much smaller numbers are also serving with or on order for the RAF as well as the air forces of Australia, New Zealand, India and South Korea.The precise identity and base of origin of the particular aircraft expected on Saturday have yet to be revealed.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusGetting outFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Prior to this another one of the key figures in thepro-democracy movement, Benny Tai, who was a Professor of Law in the University of Hong Kong was sacked from his job because of his political activities four young activists aged between  and  were arrested for allegedly “inciting secession online” and  pro-democracy candidates were disqualied from standing in the forthcoming elections to the Legislative Council which is Hong Kong’s mini parliament.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Pictured with Martin Lee, leader and founder of Hong Kong Pro-Democracy Movement and Chris Patten, EU External Relations Commissioner and before that the last governor of Hong Kong. Picture taken some time in The current Hong Kong government disqualied these  pro-democracy candidates from contesting the legislative election on the grounds that they were deemed unable to perform the duties of a lawmaker. One of the main reasons cited for their disqualication was because they “had objected in principle to the National Security Law and its promulgation”. According to the Hong Kong government, candidates must not only not oppose this law — they must also promote and support it.The National Security Law has been widely condemned by the world’s leading democratic governments because it effectively ended the autonomy of Hong Kong, suppressed human rights, free speech and political dissent.However, an even more serious development took place last Fridaywhen the pro-Beijing Hong Kong government postponed the elections that had been scheduled for September  for  months on the pretext of concerns over the resurgence of Covid . The real reason was somewhat dferent.In November , pro-democracy candidates swept the boards in the District Council Elections. Hong Kong authorities are fearful that this will be repeated in the Legislative Council elections in the wake of what has happened since then given the size of the demonstrations that were organised by pro-democracy supporters and the resentment that has been caused by the passage and implementation of the National Security Law. They are fearful that democracy campaigners could win a first ever majority in the -seat legislature. Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing supporters want to use the year long delay to use the National Security Law to introduce measures including further disqualications to guarantee a pro-China majority.This objective has been fully understood by the international community who are only too well aware that since the outbreak of Covid , elections have been able to take place in  countries without any serious health consequences including Japan, Singapore and South Korea all of which had more serious problems with this virus than Hong Kong.Increasingly concerned about recent developments the five foreign ministers of the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States on Sunday August  issued a joint statement of condemnation stating that “moves to disqualy candidates and delay the elections have undermined the democratic process that has been fundamental to Hong Kong’s stability and prosperity”.They added “We support the legitimate expectations of the people of Hong Kong to elect Legislative Council representatives via genuinely free, fair, and credible elections”. These five counties along with two fellow EU Member States, Germany and France, had earlier also suspended their extradition treaties with Hong Kong.Given the continuing crisis in Hong Kong, absolute clarity is required as to where all leaders of democratic parliamentary institutions stand on this issue. This is not the case in Northern Ireland following a meeting that First Minister, Arlene Foster accompanied by Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill had with China’s Consulate General in Belfast, Madame Zhang Meang.The Chinese consulate subsequently reported that at the meeting the two leaders of Northern Ireland’s Executive said “the Northern Ireland government cherishes friendship with China, understands and respects Hong Kong’s national security legislation...”Their attempts to distance themselves from these remarks have not been convincing and have only added to the confusion.Action should be taken to prevent China exploiting the reported remarks by Ms Foster and Ms O Neill allegedly on behalf of the Northern Ireland Executive. China will use these for propaganda purposes to justy their actions in Hong Kong. There is a simple and effective way of dispelling any doubt as to how the Northern Ireland Assembly feels about what is happening in Hong Kong — MLAs should express solidarity with their fellow pro-democracy parliamentarians in Hong Kong by condemning China’s actions and add their names to the former Hong Kong governor Chris Patten list of almost one thousand cross party international parliamentarians worldwide who have already done so.And in an act of all island parliamentary solidarity, TDs and senators in the Oireachtas should be asked to join with them in expressing their total opposition to China’s attempts to crush democracy and human rights in Hong Kong.• John Cushnahan is a former Alliance Party leader, Fine Gael MEP and European Parliament Rapporteur for Hong Kong -——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported in the Penarth Times on Thursday, the town councilsaid the results show ldquowidespread backing for changes.The survey, which attracted  responses, showed  per cent of people thought there should be more outdoor space for pedestrians and businesses.Seventy-five per cent thought parking arrangements needed to change, and  per cent said the town needs to ldquoprepare for the future.Some traders, who oppose the changes ndash specically a one-way traffic system around the town and making Windsor Road and Lower Glebe Street a traffic free zone, have said the questions in the survey were too generalised and misleading.As a result of the survey, Penarth Town Council have proposed the following changes to the original ideas:Windsor Road from Arcot Street to the roundabout as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and buses, with a mph speed limit.Lower Glebe Street as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and disabled bays. Other vehicles should not use Lower Glebe Street as a through road.Bus stops will remain as they are. There were concerns over the impact of a bus stop on Hickman Road for traders, due to air pollution, noise pollution and congestion.A two-way system to remain on Stanwell Road from the library to the traffic lights, to allow easy access to the bus stop on Rectory Road and to prevent congestion and ldquorat running through Hickman Road and Arcot Street. A two-way system to also remain from Windsor Road to Railway Terrace.The number of parking bays has also changed. There will now be  extra bays proposed, with  of them on Plassey Street.The leader of the town council, Cllr Rhiannon Birch, explained the findings and what happens next.ldquoEven before Covid-, town centres across the country were facing issues, including the need to modernise infrastructure, and the impact of online shopping, she said. ldquoThe current pandemic has added to the scale of the challenge.ldquoThe consultation shows that a clear majority recognise the need for a degree of change in the town centre, both for it to survive in the present and to thrive in future.ldquoThe results call for the establishment of a greater degree of safe space and proposals which increase a degree of pedestrianisation whilst also increasing parking spaces.ldquoThe results show substantial agreement on these aims. Reflecting this widespread and clear response, Penarth Town Council calls on our partners in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to embrace the results and recommendations.ldquoSpecically, Penarth Town Council believes that creating a safer environment through the closure of Windsor Road to traffic for part of the day, between Arcot Street and the roundabout, including the Lower Glebe Street, would be the best way to ensure that people can feel confident about shopping safely. It would allow safe use of the space in front of shops, bars, cafes and restaurants.ldquoIt also lessens the need for one-way systems on pavements for pedestrians, which are perplexing for many and hard to implement. These proposals can be achieved in a way which also increases the amount of parking spaces available.The results will now be put to the Vales Planning Committee for consultation.For more information, visit https:www.penarthtowncouncil.gov.uk news survey-results Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I am so interested in how the legal world is changing and in particular looking at which laws we maintain and which we change coming out of the EU.ldquoCoupling law with French means that I can look at the international side of law and I am very much looking forward to learning more about both the British and French legal systems.ldquoIt is also very attractive to me to think about what the law should be from a moral perspective rather than just its application.Enyala by contrast was less sure of the direction she was going to take until she attended an Oxbridge conference in Swansea.ldquoThis was the first time I was introduced to material science she said. ldquoI really liked the structure of Oxfordrsquos course and the mixture of physics, chemistry and maths in the subject ndash it is very broad and follows on well from my EQP in nuclear energy.Both girls joined top school Cardf Sixth Form College on a  per cent scholarship from their local state school where they achieved  A*s each at GCSE.ldquoChanging schools has been a really good preparation for university le, Enyala said.ldquoIt has certainly made me more independent and aware of the world.

startCall for action on accessible toilet facilities at GosfordNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPoliticsPlan for  homes in Portadown gets green lightA controversial plan for a further  houses to be built near Lisnisky Lane, was approved at August’s meeting of Armagh, City Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council’s planning and regulatory services committee.By The NewsroomThursday, th August , : am\"\"The outline application lodged by agent Alan Patterson Design Ltd, on behalf of applicant Sustar Ltd will see approximately  dwellings and a crèche built on lands to the east of Bracken Lodge Lisnisky Road and Lisnisky Lane.The development of this . acres site will be delivered in phases, each of which will require further planning approval.There are also conditions attached to phases withplanning officers wanting to ensure plans for the proposed crèche are submitted and approved by the Council by the time the th dwelling is approved.The crèche must also be completed and operated prior to the occupation of the th house.This is to ensure that the community facility approved within the application is provided.One of the conditions attached to this approval will ensure a two lane approach to roundabout  is submitted to and approved in writing by the Council and this work shall be completed prior to the occupation of  households.The outline proposal also includes a new access point to these lands to be created approximately m south of No  Lisnisky Lane.The application has receiveda total of  letters of objection from four separatepostal addresses and one letter of support.Speaking against the proposal on Wednesday afternoon, Councillor Margaret Tinsley said she was not against the application for new housing but was very concerned about “traffic congestion in the area at peak times”.“Prior to COVID, traffic was queuedback from roundabout  to roundabout  already so how will these roads cope with potentially another , cars,” said the DUP representative.“Any improvement the Department for Infrastructureare to make to the roads need to be in place now, not when the houses are built.“I am not against these new homes totally I just want to ensure these traffic problems do not escalate further.”Speaking on behalf of the application, SDLP Councillor Joe Nelson reminded the committee the lands are already zoned for housing.“These proposals are for very high quality development, there will becrèche facilities on site and homeowners will be able to walk to local places of employment.“This fits in with the singular concept of Craigavon and will be a great boost to the local economy with development costs of over £ million.“I understand the concerns around traffic but I trust the DfI engineers have done their job and I commend the developer and the team working on this proposal as they have clearly worked hard to come up with this excellent proposal.”Ulster Unionist Councillor Sam Nicholson identied traffic congestion as the biggest bugbear with regards to this application and asked road service how they had got to the point where they are happy with the application.A member of Road Serviceinformed the committee that a transport assessment had been submitted as part of the application and was found to be acceptable.“A range of road improvements are being delivered with this application in a phased manner, including a link road to Old Lurgan Road and a two lane approach to roundabout ,” said the DfI representative.It was also revealed that traffic management modelling showed Craigavon’s roundabout’s worked in isolation but when joined together, the problems stemmed from the hospital roundabout junction.“This was passed on to my colleagues in development control and it was their decision to accept what was presented,” said another DfI representative.Following questioning about the condition of Lisnisky Lane from Councillor Peter Lavery, Council’s case officer in charge of the report advised this application was an outline application.“In future applications access will have to be considered and no development shall commence until work has been carried out at roundabout ,” said the case officer.“Proposals for a new access to the hospital have been submitted this week but that has to go through due process we can’t take for granted that will be approved when considering this application.”Alderman Sydney Anderson said he saw this development as an opportunity.“As the development is being built I would like to think Road Service would take on board the need to develop the road network as well,” said the DUP representative.Sinn Fein Councillor Paul Duffy describedthe area as “growing” while his party colleague Councillor Garath Keating said it was clear that traffic was a problem in the area but didn’t feel this was the developer’s fault.“I don’t think we can lay the blame for traffic problems on a new development,” said Cllr Keating.“If you are going to use traffic problems as a reason to refuse this application it would be very prejudicial on availabilityof new housing.”Councillor Peter Lavery said he was in agreement with this assessment but was mindful of the need to continue to monitor road use as the dferent phases of this application were submitted.Ulster Unionist Councillor Sam Nicholson said there was work to be done with this application.“The traffic problem is not a unique problem and I don’t think we can blame the developer for that, the onus is on the Department to future proof the road network,” said Councillor Nicholson.SDLP Councillor Mealla Campbell said she had been reassured by all she had heard and proposed accepting the outline application.This proposal was seconded by Councillor Paul Duffy and committee members voiced their agreement.Speaking on behalf of Sustar, development consultant Michael Hannath welcomed the positive decision for this application which he said will be very signicant for the local area. He said: “Demand for new homes in this location remains very healthy and our agents have already received direct expressions of interest from over  parties for future housing in the next phases since the first phase at Bracken Hall was completed.”Michael went on to point out that the application has already gone through a rigorous planning process and has been subject to a wider environmental impact assessment and subsequent comprehensive environmental statement. As part of that process, he said, there have been detailed traffic assessments carried out and important input from a multi-disciplinary team of competent experts led by planning consultants Oriel Planning. Detailed surveys and reports have been carried out in Traffic and Transport, Ecology, Hydrogeology, Geology and Soils, Drainage and Flood Risk, Noise and Vibration, Air Quality and Contaminated Land and Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment. In addition, community consultation events have taken place at which feedback has been received and taken on board. He said: “Some local residents have objected to the proposal because of concerns that they believe increased housing will add to an already congested stretch of road between the Lisnisky Lane roundabout and the hospital roundabout and heading into town. The main concerns appear to be around traffic congestion at peak am times particularly where we have the merging of traffic from the two-lane carriageway into a single lane coming from Craigavon direction and heading towards the hospital.”Michael pointed out: “Numerous consultations with Dfi roads over the past three years have informed the proposals and detailed design considerations have been integrated in order to address these concerns. The development team are confident that the development meets the design requirements and policy set out by Dfi Roads and this has been confirmed by Dfi roads in their final consultation responses. “The current proposal includes the widening of Lisnisky Lane at the approach to roundabout . There will be a flare lane added at the bottom of Lisnisky Lane for traffic turning left towards town which should reduce the traffic backing up in this area and permit traffic flow coming down Lisnisky Lane to go around the roundabout and head out of town.“In addition, the approval has a condition which requires the delivery of a second access to the lands before the occupation of the th house.“Sustar have been working with Dfi Roads and the Trust to assist with the delivery of a suitable option and a design for a new roundabout on Lisnisky Lane at the back entrance to hospital has now been finalised.“The developer has been working with Dfi roads and the Trust to facilitate the delivery of this for some time now and we understand a planning application is expected to be lodged imminently by the Trust. The proposed roundabout approved will provide a new well needed second access to the Hospital, a realignment of Lisnisky Lane heading to the old Lurgan Road and a connection into the development lands. This roundabout would greatly relieve the peak hour traffic congestion.”Michael was keen to point out that the positive economic impact of this development is “very signicant for the local economy. It will generate employment and jobs across a iety of disciplines, construction jobs, both skilled and unskilled as well as jobs in the materials supply and marketing sectors”. In total the development costs of this housing scheme are estimated to be in excess of £ million at present day costs “with a consequential inflow of benefits both financial and social into the local and wider economies”. He said the developers will now work with the council’s planning team and Dfi roads to bring forward detailed proposals for the final design stage of the development which is proposed to take place over phases and has an expected timeframe of - years.“This proposal will bring very signicant investment to our local economy at a time when it could do with an injection of positive new,” Michael concluded.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"vj day event welcomed dup and sf ","story":"Lockhart raises concerns over NI Protocol during Gove visitPlan for  homes in Portadown gets green lightNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPoliticsVJ Day event welcomed by DUP and SFArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council’s event to celebrate the th anniversary of VJ Day has been welcomed by both the DUP and Sinn Fein.By The NewsroomThursday, th August , : pm\"\"Council has confirmed a shared history event to mark the occasion will take place this Saturday, August .Many local people were heldas Japanese prisoners of war and the stories of their experience still haunt the families to this day.The event will include a lecture from renowned historian Dr Eamon Phoenix, poetry reading by local historian Richard Edgar and a musical accompaniment from piper Ian Burrows.Speaking about the event, Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage said: “Shared history events are important for a ided society.“We hope that by embracing social media and digital technology we can attract wider audiences comprised of people who – for ious reasons – might not normally attend such an event in person.“With COVID- still very much a concern at the moment, we are hoping to run more online events like these to ensure we’re minimising the risk to our residents while still offering the excellent events we’re known for, albeit in a slightly dferent way.”DUP group whip Councillor Darryn Causby said it was important for Council to mark the occasion, widely regarded as the end of the second World War.“It is important for Council to mark this occasion,” he said.“We are obviously disappointed that it could not be marked in a more substantial way than what we are doing.“However, we welcome the fact all parties recognise the vital role the British Army played during the second World War and we welcome that across the piece.”Speaking about ABC Council’s shared history event SinnFein group leader, Councillor Liam Mackle said: “Many local people lost their lives in this conflict.“The Lord Mayor will pay special tribute to local man Jim Haughey.
