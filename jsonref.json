The total number of cases in Japan has surpassed 4 million. The country has started to see a decline in daily new Covid cases but experts have warned that deaths may continue to increase due to a recent series of infection clusters at facilities for elderly people. “The growth in the number of severely ill patients is likely to continue for a while,” said Shigeru Omi, chairperson of the government’s coronavirus subcommittee on Monday. The latest figures come after the Imperial Household Agency confirmed that Princess Yoko of Japan has developed moderate pneumonia after testing positive for coronavirus. Yoko, 38, was admitted to the University of Tokyo hospital on Tuesday after complaining of a sore throat early last week. In this week’s episode of the Science Weekly podcast, Madeleine Finlay gets the  science correspondent Hannah Devlin’s view on whether there’s scientific evidence backing up this decision and what the changes could look like. You can listen to the episode here: What will ‘living with Covid’ actually mean? The proposal, which will be submitted to the prime minister for approval, follows similar reopening steps taken by other Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand and the Philippines, where the Omicron variant has caused a recent surge in new infections, but fewer hospitalisations and deaths than previous variants. The proposal includes maintaining a one-day quarantine requirement for visitors plus requiring negative Covid tests before departure and on arrival. Vietnam announced a record 31,814 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday, adding to the more than 2.54 million infections so far. It has recorded about 39,000 deaths overall. It imposed among the world’s strictest border controls two years ago as the coronavirus pandemic swept the globe. Since November, Vietnam has allowed foreign tourists to visit designated places under a vaccine passport programme and had originally aimed to fully reopen the industry from June. I’ll be handing the blog over to my colleague Lucy Campbell for the next hour. Thank you for reading. The 95-year-old monarch held virtual audiences from Windsor Castle and was pictured speaking with the Estonian ambassador via video-link from Buckingham Palace. The Queen spent time with Charles last Tuesday, when the prince was carrying out an investiture on her behalf at her Windsor Castle home. On Thursday, he revealed he has tested positive for the virus. At the time Buckingham Palace said the Queen was not displaying any symptoms of the virus. Yesterday Clarence House confirmed that Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, had also tested positive for the virus.The race and equality thinktank the Runnymede Trust successfully won its claim against the government over the appointment in August 2020 of Harding as interim executive chair of the National Institute for Health Protection, as well as the appointment in September 2020 of Mike Coupe as director of testing at NHS test and trace. Two judges granted a declaration to the Runnymede Trust on Tuesday after considering arguments at a high court hearing in December. The campaign group the Good Law Project had joined the trust in making complaints – arguing the government had not adopted an “open” process when making appointments to posts “critical to the pandemic response”. However, judges dismissed the claim by the Good Law Project. Lord Justice Singh and Mr Justice Swift concluded that Hancock had not complied with “the public sector equality duty” in relation to the appointments. The country’s pandemic controller, David Manning, announced today that he had revoked rules requiring approval to enter Papua New Guinea and mandatory quarantine, Agence France-Presse reports. Some domestic restrictions will remain, including compulsory mask-wearing in markets, shops, on public transport and places of worship, as well as a limit of 100 people for gatherings. More than 37,000 Covid-19 cases have been recorded in Papua New Guinea since the start of the pandemic, but it is believed that the true number of cases is far higher, with low testing rates and widespread stigma about Covid-19. The country’s health care system has long been plagued by shortages of drugs, funding, an ailing infrastructure and a severe lack of health workers. The total number of deaths involving Covid in the UK reached 183,502 in early February, figures published this morning show.  The Office for National Statistics recorded 1,242 registrations where Covid was mentioned on the death certificate in England and Wales in the week to 4 February, or one in 10 deaths.  Overall, the number of deaths occurring have remained below the five-year average for six weeks, now having been higher than normal for close to six months. There was a slight increase in the number of deaths among care home residents in England and Wales in the last week covered by the data. A total of 341 care home residents died with Covid in the week to 4 February, rising from 333 a week earlier.  The figure recorded by the ONS is different to the government’s official count of 159,605 because the latter only records those deaths that are known to have occurred within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, while the ONS counts all deaths where the virus was mentioned on the death certificate.“The National Capital Region and the entire Philippines now have a low-risk classification” in terms of case growth, prevalence and health system capacity, said Karlo Nograles, person for President Rodrigo Duterte. Cases have averaged about 3,600 daily in the past week although there are concerns that infections may rise as campaigning for the 9 May presidential elections begins, with political rallies seen as potential super-spreader events.  The government plans to lift all restrictions, the health undersecretary, Maria Rosario Vergeire, promised, but she refused to give a specific time frame. “When that happens, all restrictions will be lifted and everything will be under self-regulation,” she added. More than 55,000 people have died in the Phillippines, according to government data, although a recent new report suggests the true number of deaths may be double the health department’s official numbers.All workers in Italy over the age of 50 are now obliged to show proof of vaccination or recovery from Covid-19 within the last six months to access their workplace. The measure was announced in early January, when daily infections were hovering around 200,000 a day and hospitals were under pressure, and took effect on Wednesday. The vaccine was also made mandatory for the over-50s on 8 January. Of the 2.4 million people over the age of 50 who had not been vaccinated on that date, about 1.7m are still unvaccinated, according to Wired Italia. Workers aged over 50 make up 8.8 million of the population. Italy has among the strictest Covid-19 rules in Europe, and is easing them slowly, for example the requirement to wear masks outside was scrapped last Friday.  But Matteo Salvini, the leader of the League, the far-right party that is part of prime minister Mario Draghi’s broad coalition, is pushing for all restrictions to be lifted in March.  “We can’t be the ones with the most rules,” he said. Infections have dropped sharply in recent weeks, with 28,630 registered on Monday, and hospitalisations have been falling. However, Italy is still recording a stubbornly high death rate, with 281 further fatalities reported on Monday.Japan has seen more than 100 daily deaths since early this year, mostly among the elderly population, amid a sixth wave of infections driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant. The total number of cases in Japan has surpassed 4 million. The country has started to see a decline in daily new Covid cases but experts have warned that deaths may continue to increase due to a recent series of infection clusters at facilities for elderly people. “The growth in the number of severely ill patients is likely to continue for a while,” said Shigeru Omi, chairperson of the government’s coronavirus subcommittee on Monday.

Yoko, 38, was admitted to the University of Tokyo hospital on Tuesday after complaining of a sore throat early last week. More on the worsening coronavirus situation in Hong Kong, where hospitals are buckling under the strain of soaring cases driven by the Omicron variant and at least two medical facilities have placed patients in beds outside their entrances. Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, told reporters today she had “no plans whatsoever” to impose a mainland China-style “complete, wholesale” lockdown.  But she insisted zero-Covid remained her administration’s goal, despite mounting pressure from public health experts and business figures to switch to a mitigation strategy.

Photograph: iStockIt is the largest study abroad programme of its type in the world. In fact, it has been so successful that the term “Erasmus” is now the internationally understood shorthand for those who study abroad no matter what the funding background.Since it was established 35 years ago, millions of students across Europe have left the comfort zone of their home institution to spend study or traineeship visits in another European country, among them tens of thousands of students from Ireland.For the first time in the history of the Erasmus programme, the Irish Government is to dip into the national purse to provide financial support for students seeking to study and work abroad. A surge in demand has left the Erasmus+ national agency at the Higher Education Authority (HEA) seriously short of funds.A co-fund of €7 million is being made available by Minister for Further and Higher Education Simon Harris in two tranches – €3.5 million in 2022 and €3.5 million in 2023 – to help bridge the shortfall. The Government also anticipates that freeing up more places in Ireland will enable the sector to admit more fellow Europeans who would normally have gone to the United Kingdom.This welcome intervention has been made necessary by a massive 66 per cent increase in demand for places on the programme under the 2021-22 call. The HEA’s Erasmus+ national agency, which manages the higher education element of the programme received applications for more than 8,700 study and work abroad periods from the participating higher education institutions compared to 5,500 for the 2020-21 year.But a huge problem resulted when the European Commission was not in a position to provide the promised additional funding at the start of the latest iteration of the programme, which covers the period 2021-27.The national agency has had its budget for the 2021-22 academic year slashed by €3 million (a 25 per cent cut) down to €9 million compared to €12 million for 2020-21. This dip will be recovered from 2023 when EU funds will rise appreciably.Without the Government funds, the agency would only be able to support about 3,200 student mobilities and 250 staff visits. Thanks to the additional €3.5 million, another 1,500 iniduals can be assisted in 2022 and a similar number in 2023.The commitment does not extend beyond 2023. By then, the Government expects the extra funds from the European Commission will kick in. Applications always exceed actual realised mobilities with the highest outward-bound number to date being recorded in 2019 at 3,995. A realisation of 4,700 mobilities by summer 2022 will be a national record.The challenge is mainly felt by the eight Irish University Association universities plus Munster Technological University who account for some 87 per cent of total outbound numbers.Those with the largest growth are University of Limerick (+364), NUI Galway (+326), Trinity College Dublin (+264), University College Dublin (+261), Dublin City University (+170) and TU Dublin (+100).Driving the numbersComing off the back of a very travel unfriendly Covid landscape, the rise in demand is somewhat surprising. A significant feature driving the numbers is the fact that 1,500 mobilities are for students who must spend mandatory spells of one or two semesters of their degree programmes abroad.Other reasons posited are the greater flexibilities offered under the new programme, which, subject to certain conditions, permit study abroad periods of as short as five to 30 days compared to the traditional minimum two months studywork stays.Another very positive development has been the decision by the European Commission to provide mandatory supplementary social inclusion support of €250 per month.The net result of this is that a Susi (Student Universal Support Ireland) student will be able to receive roughly €550 for a study visit (up from €480) and €670 for a traineeshipwork placement (compared to €500 per month, maximum). The Erasmus+ national agency voluntarily introduced top-up social inclusion support in 2014 and was heading for a 20 per cent participation rate from Susi recipients before the pandemic struck.The Covid-19 pandemic has badly disrupted the student “experience” over the last two years. Remote learning and close campuses took their toll. With savings from the pandemic unemployment payment in the bank, students may have a bit more disposable income in their pockets to recover some of that lost learning by embarking on a studywork period in another EUEEA country."},{"url":null,"title":"docklands companies call for dublin port to be moved","story":"The demand for Dublin port ‘to move on’ from its current location was set in a planning submission to Dublin City Council by the Docklands Business Forum, a body comprising 200 local companiesCompanies based in Dublin’s docklands have called for the city port to be moved from the mouth of the Liffey, saying more than 200 hectares of port land could be better used for housing and offices.The demand for the port “to move on” from its current location was set in a planning submission to Dublin City Council by the Docklands Business Forum, a body comprising 200 local companies including Google and consultants Accenture.“It is a bold statement and we gave it consideration,” said forum chief executive Alan Robinson, arguing it no longer makes sense to locate Ireland’s largest port so near the city centre.But the call was quickly dismissed by Dublin Port chief executive Eamonn O’Reilly, whose State-owned organisation rejected the idea of a megaproject to move the port in a series of studies released two years ago.“We have had no serious or detailed response to what we published from anyone, let alone from the Docklands Business Forum, and we don’t take their views at all seriously,” Mr O’Reilly said.“We don’t think it’s possible to get planning permission. European environmental law would stop it.”Development planThe forum made its views known in a formal submission on the city council’s 2022-2028 draft development plan, one of more than 1,000 made before a deadline lapsed on Monday. Dublin Port also made a submission.The forum said: “Post-Brexit, Ireland’s porting facilities would be more efficiently dispersed to publicprivate facilities in Bremore on the Dublin-Meath border, Rosslare Europort in Wexford and the Port of Cork.”The group added: “It is out of step of international best practice for a port so closely located in the city centre to not only refuse to seriously consider moving to a more appropriate location but to seek, as the Dublin Port Company does, to double its capacity.”Mr O’Reilly replied by saying the work under way at the moment was required to avoid the Dublin Port reaching maximum capacity as early as 2030.“Everything we’re doing today will allow us to keep going until about 2040 and more port capacity will be needed after that. That work needs to start today and it doesn’t involve moving Dublin Port.”In its submission to the council, the port company said Dublin city and region required all of the utilities that currently exist in the port.“It is important, therefore, that the new development plan supports the continued operation and development of all of these essential utilities and does not intentionally or unintentionally hinder either their current operations or their future development,” it said.The submission said it was crucial that the new development plan did not zone land identified in the port’s 2040 masterplan “or include policies which could preclude necessary future developments” from delivery.“This is particularly relevant following the allocation of large land areas within the Port Estate to statutory authorities because of Brexit. This allocation reduced the amount of land available to provide port capacity.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"About 2.4 million forced to leave their homes during 13-year-long war with Boko HaramTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"sweden right covid along","story":"To understand Sweden, you need to understand a word that’s hard to explain, let alone translate: lagom. It means, in effect, “perfect-simple”: not too much, not too little. People who are lagom don’t stand out or make a fuss: they blend right in – and this is seen as a virtue. Essays are written about why lagom sums up a certain Swedish mindset – that it’s bad to stand out, to consider yourself better or be an outlier. That’s why it’s so strange that, during the lockdowns, Sweden became the world’s defiant outlier.Swedes saw it the other way around. They were keeping calm and carrying on: lockdown was an extreme, draconian, untested experiment. Lock up everyone, keep children out of school, suspend civil liberties, send police after people walking their dogs – and call this “caution”? Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s state epidemiologist, never spoke about a Swedish “experiment”. He said all along he could not recommend a public health intervention that had never been proven.Tegnell also made another point: that he didn’t claim to be right. It would take years, he’d argue, to see who had jumped the right way. His calculation was that, on a whole-society basis, the collateral damage of lockdowns would outweigh what good they do. But you’d only know if this was so after a few years. You’d have to look at cancer diagnosis, hospital waiting lists, educational damage and, yes, count the Covid dead. Almost two years on, we can look at the early indications.The problem with lockdowns is that no one looks at whole-society pictures. Professor Neil Ferguson’s team from Imperial College London admitted this, once, as a breezy aside. “We do not consider the wider social and economic costs of suppression,” they wrote in a supposed assessment of lockdown, “which will be high.” But just how high? And were they a price worth paying?As Sweden abolishes all domestic Covid restrictions, it emerges with one of Europe’s lower Covid death tolls: the rate is 1,614 per million people, just over half the amount of Britain (2,335). Given that our death tolls were comparable at first (both among the worst anywhere), it’s hard to argue that there’s some demographic force which meant Covid was never going to spread in Sweden. Nor is it possible to argue that Sweden was some hedonistic party-nation: its people were incredibly cautious. But unlike Brits, they had a government that trusted them.There were some Swedish diktats: a “rule of eight” was set up for a while. Bars, restaurants and cafes were all socially distanced and, at one point, had to close by 8.30pm. For a few weeks, Swedes even had vaccine passports. But that was about it: the rest was guidance, and it was followed.What no statistic can convey is just how careful Swedes were something that struck me whenever I’d visit. It was perfectly legal to meet up in bars and for a fika in a coffee shop, but most didn’t. A friend of mine had a rule that she’d only ever meet friends outside – even in the Stockholm winter (she did this so much that she got frostbite). In summer last year, studies showed Swedes working from home more than in any other European country.This kept Covid low, while the lack of rules allowed for people to use their judgement while minimising economic and social damage. Sweden’s GDP fell by 2.9 per cent in 2020, while Britain’s collapsed by 9.4 per cent. Both have bounded back, but Sweden’s economy is this year expected to be five per cent larger than before the pandemic, versus two per cent for Germany. The UK will be about one per cent, one of the lowest figures in Europe. The cost of the various Covid measures is best summed up by the debt mountain: an extra £8,400 per head in Britain, and £3,000 in Sweden.Swedish schools kept going throughout, with no face masks. Sixth-formers and undergraduates switched to home learning, but the rest of Swedish children went to school as normal. That’s not to say there weren’t absences as the virus spread: it was common to see a third, at times even half of the class absent due to sniffles or suspected Covid. But there were no full-scale closures and, aside from some suspicions about minor grade inflation (the average maths grade sneaked up to 10.1, from 9.3), there is no talk in Sweden about educational devastation.In Britain, there is calamity and cover-up. By doling out more A grades than ever before – and telling universities to make more space – young people could be shovelled through the system with lost ground never recognised or quite made up.Grade inflation was staggering: the number of A-level students marked at A or A* jumped to 45 per cent, up from 26 per cent pre-pandemic, but no one doubts that these students learned far less. By some measures, educational inequality has been set back 10 years. But some problems are too big to admit.Academics suggest the effect of lost education is permanent: less education inevitably means lower salaries and slower career progression. The Institute for Fiscal Studies talks about £40,000 of lost lifetime earnings per pupil in Britain, £350 billion in all. Swedish studies estimate that Covid’s impact (on absenteeism and home-learning) could mean an £800 million overall hit – far smaller than the impact on Britain’s lost school days.The impact on hospital waiting lists is also very different. Fear of a virus keeps people away – at the peak of the first wave, attendance at Swedish A\u0026ampE was 31 per cent lower than normal in Britain, it collapsed by 57 per cent. Routine operations were down by 20 per cent in Sweden and 34 per cent in England, so waiting lists grew in both countries. As they did pretty much world over.But no country, anywhere, has had a waiting list grow as big as Britain’s: from 4.4 million pre-pandemic, it will keep getting worse for two years and peak at about 9.2 million, according to NHS modelling – that’s equivalent to one in five adults. A top-down health service is more easily disrupted if it’s ordered to transform into a Covid service (and people are told to “protect the NHS” by not using it). Sweden’s waiting lists, 130,000 pre-pandemic, hit 170,000 last October. Even adjusting for population, it’s nowhere near the size of Britain’s problem.Sweden will not declare victory. No one was properly prepared for Covid, and The country’s failure to protect care home residents is still seen as a national scandal. Sweden also took a bigger hit than its neighbours: Denmark, which did lock down, has more to shout about when it comes to combining a lower Covid hit with minimal economic disruption. But, as Tegnell would say, it’s still too early to say – with any finality – who got it right and who didn’t.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: \u0026#39Of course\u0026#39 we don\u0026#39t want war in Europe, says Vladimir PutinPolitics latest news: \u0026#39Of course\u0026#39 I can fight and win the next election, insists Boris JohnsonRussian withdrawal may be a sign Vladimir Putin thinks he has already won Matt Hancock failed to comply with equality duty over Dido Harding appointment, High Court rulesChina\u0026#39s Olympics have been a catastrophic failureQueen gets back to work after Covid scareMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bbcs absurd attempt prove belongs us exposes vanity","story":"Somebody in the BBC hierarchy must have thought this was a great idea. And quite a lot of people inside the organisation must have agreed – given the innumerable committee meetings that it would have passed through to gain approval.Having seen the overwhelming triumph of the campaign to protect the NHS by presenting it as a national institution that belongs to all of us, the Corporation has now launched an embarrassingly desperate public relations onslaught with precisely the same theme.It is, believe it or not, “your BBC” – even when it righteously screens out what it regards as your unacceptable views, or imposes its particular version of social virtue on the nation, or refuses to apologise for what you may see as an offensive anti-Semitic slur.The clumsily worded slogan – “The BBC is something that belongs to all of us” (something? what exactly?) – is apparently to become a ubiquitous refrain in its endless self-promotion, but if you want the full length version, you can view a video on iPlayer entitled This is our BBC.This opus is obviously designed to be hilarious, proffering the subtext “we don’t really take ourselves too seriously” when, in fact, what it reveals is that the BBC sees itself as a sacrosanct mainstay of British identity.Whatever you may have been tempted to conclude, it insists, we are not an out-of-touch, self-regarding purveyor of our own particular worldview which regards much public opinion as beneath contempt.Listen to what we are saying now about how we view ourselves and, above all, be aware that we cannot carry out this mission without your participation.That somebody – indeed, lots of people – within the organisation felt that this absurd exercise was appropriate tells you something about the state of mind at Broadcasting House.The Corporation has reacted to the threat to its future and its antiquated funding model in precisely the wrong way. Instead of listening with a semblance of respect to the criticisms made of its attitude and judgment, it has become more arrogant and aggressive.In its news and current affairs programming, it has become more insular and enclosed. What passes for discussion on the news consists of a BBC presenter interviewing a BBC correspondent who repeats a pre-scripted version of what the presenter has just provided.Instead of opening itself up to genuine arguments or to alternative opinions that are enlivening public discourse in the real world, it shuts down any possibility of disagreement. The result is predictable, anodyne and anti-democratic.In much of what should be apolitical programming – entertainment and lifestyle genres – it inserts themes and directives which clearly have a political intent and treats any public resistance to this as a form of heresy.Who do they think they are fooling? The BBC isn’t yours – it’s theirs.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: Boris Johnson welcomes diplomacy but says \u0026#39intelligence still not encouraging\u0026#39Politics latest news: \u0026#39Of course\u0026#39 I can fight and win the next election, insists Boris JohnsonRussian withdrawal may be a sign Vladimir Putin thinks he has already won Matt Hancock failed to comply with equality duty over Dido Harding appointment, High Court rulesChina\u0026#39s Olympics have been a catastrophic failureQueen gets back to work after Covid scareMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pe teacher accused sleeping 18 year old pupil premier inn struck","story":"A PE teacher who was accused of sleeping with a pupil at a Premier Inn after “dancing inappropriately” with him at the school prom has been struck off. The General Teaching Council for Scotland decided to remove Melissa Tweedie, 27,  from the teaching register following an investigation into her behaviour at a Glasgow leavers night. However, it did not find allegations she slept with an 18-year-old proven. The former teacher at Gleniffer High School in Paisley, Renfrewshire, was investigated over claims that she had slept with the pupil in June 2017 when he was 18. She was spotted dancing inappropriately with pupils and taking shots with them at the bar at the event, before later being seen on a bed with a teenage pupil.He told the teaching regulator during a five-day hearing that the teacher had sex with him after he drank wine, gin, shots and beer. This was denied by Ms Tweedie, who told the school\u0027s headteacher that she was at home when he phoned her from the hotel foyer trying to find her.She later admitted to investigators that she woke up in bed with the pupil but denied having sex with him, further claiming that she may have been spiked.On Monday, the teaching council did not find this allegation proven on the weight of evidence presented to the panel.But the regulator decided to issue Ms Tweedie with a removal order, stating that her conduct fell significantly short of the standard expected of a registered teacher.It was found that the teacher kissed a student, named as Pupil A in proceedings, at the Premier Inn hotel. It was also proven that she stated words to the effect of: Can we for a minute act like I\u0027m not a teacher, to a pupil(s) and when alone on a bed with Pupil A.It was also proven that when another student, named as Pupil E, entered the room, Ms Tweedie said words to the effect of: Technically I haven\u0027t touched him yet, to Pupil E.Speaking on behalf of the panel, Arthur Stewart said: It is the view of the panel that the teacher has fallen significantly short of the standards and therefore is unfit to teach.As Miss Tweedie has been found unfit to teach the panel must direct that Miss Tweedie\u0027s name be removed from the General Teaching Council from Scotland\u0027s register.Gary Burton, the presenting officer, recommended that the panel impose the maximum of two years before she can reapply.More from NewsPolitics latest news: \u0026#39Of course\u0026#39 I can fight and win the next election, insists Boris JohnsonRussia-Ukraine crisis: Boris Johnson welcomes diplomacy but says \u0026#39intelligence still not encouraging\u0026#39Russian withdrawal may be a sign Vladimir Putin thinks he has already won Matt Hancock failed to comply with equality duty over Dido Harding appointment, High Court rulesChina\u0026#39s Olympics have been a catastrophic failureQueen gets back to work after Covid scareMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed hrt may prevent dying covid","story":"Hormone replacement therapy may protect older women from dying of Covid, a study suggests.Swedish and Finnish researchers at the University of Umea and the U1niversity of Helsinki, studied the records of 14,685 women aged between 50 and 80 who contracted coronavirus between February and September 2020.They found that women taking HRT were 54 per cent less likely to have died from their infection than those who were not using oestrogen supplementation.They also discovered that breast cancer sufferers who were taking drugs to help control their disease by suppressing oestrogen had more than double the risk of death.Around one in 10 women (10.1 per cent) on oestrogen suppressing drugs died during the study period compared with about one in 50 (2.1 per cent) of women on HRT and one in 20 (4.6 per cent) for the control group.The link with oestrogen may also explain why fewer women have died during the pandemic than men, the researchers said, suggesting the hormone has a protective effect.In a paper published in BMJ open, the authors conclude: “This study shows an association between oestrogen levels and Covid-19 death.“Consequently, drugs increasing oestrogen levels may have a role in therapeutic efforts to alleviate Covid-19 severity in postmenopausal women and could be studied in randomised control trials.”Even after accounting for potentially influential factors, such as age, annual disposable income, educational attainment and existing health conditions, the odds of dying from Covid-19 remained significantly lower (53 per cent) for women on HRT.However, British experts urged women to be cautious before turning to HRT to protect them from Covid-19.Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “The findings are apparently dramatic. However, it must be remembered that there is a long history of observational studies, especially in relation to hormone therapy, making dramatic claims of benefits that have not been confirmed in randomised trials.“There are short-term benefits of hormone therapy but women should not, based on this or other observational studies, be advised to take hormone therapy for a supposed benefit on death from Covid-19.”Researchers also found that age was significantly associated with the risk of dying from the virus, with each extra year associated with 15 per cent greater odds, while every additional coexisting condition increased the odds of death by 13 per cent.Those with the lowest household incomes were nearly three times as likely to die as those with the highest.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: Boris Johnson welcomes diplomacy but says \u0026#39intelligence still not encouraging\u0026#39Politics latest news: \u0026#39Of course\u0026#39 I can fight and win the next election, insists Boris JohnsonRussian withdrawal may be a sign Vladimir Putin thinks he has already won Matt Hancock failed to comply with equality duty over Dido Harding appointment, High Court rulesChina\u0026#39s Olympics have been a catastrophic failureQueen gets back to work after Covid scareMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"russian withdrawal may sign vladimir putin thinks has already","story":"Vladimir Putin wrongfooted the world again on Tuesday with the surprise announcement Russia is withdrawing some of its troops from around Ukraine.The question facing the West now is whether the move is a sign the crisis is abating — or just another tactical manouvre on the part of the Kremlin.On the face of it, the announcement appears to fit the view that the presence of the troops has always been a bluff on Mr Putin’s part.“February 15, 2022, will go down in history as the day when Western war propaganda failed,” a Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman crowed on Tuesday. “They were humiliated and defeated without a single shot.”The taunt was directed at US predictions Russia would invade on Wednesday, but it may have contained a deeper message.Mr Putin has every reason to believe he has secured a major strategic victory without going to war.He has reasserted Russia as a superpower, brought Western leaders scurrying to meet with him in Moscow and left the whole world hanging on his next move.He appeared to give the game away with Monday\u0027s weird staged meeting for the television cameras, in which his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, reported back that the chances of a diplomatic solution were “far from exhausted” and Russia should keep going.Indeed, Mr Putin has been transparent about this tactic for months. In November he told Russian diplomats “tensions” with the West were a good thing and that it was “important for them to remain in this state for as long as possible.”But the question is: why stop now? Perhaps, like an experienced gambler, Mr Putin just wants to quite while he is ahead. But the timing seems odd.Only a day ago he seemed on the verge of an even bigger win, after the Ukrainian ambassador to Britain suggested his country could be ready to abandon its ambitions of Nato membership to avoid war, only for Kyiv to slap him down.That was Mr Putin’s central demand, yet now he appears to be backing down just when it is within reach.One possibility is that negotiations are taking place than we don\u0027t know about. Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany made an intriguing comment on Tuesday when he called for Olaf Scholz to “bang with his first, but maybe also with his shoe if necessary” on Mr Putin’s table during his visit to Moscow.It was an odd remark that seemed designed to call to mind Nikita Kruschchev, who famously banged his shoe on a desk at the United Nations, and who was Soviet leader during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, the moment the US and the Soviets came closest to war.The Cuban Missile Crisis was resolved with a secret deal agreed via back channel negotiations led by Robert F Kennedy.It is possible there are talks being conducted through similar back channels of which we know nothing today.It is worth noting that Boris Johnson and Joe Biden said there was still hope for a diplomatic solution on Monday night, just ahead of Russia’s announcement it was pulling troops back.But it is important to be cautious about reading too much into Russia’s announcement.“All warfare is based on deception,” Sun Tzu wrote in The Art of War. “When using our forces, we must appear inactive when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away when far away, we must make him believe we are near.”Far from being a sign that the crisis is over, a Russian withdrawal could be a classic feint. Mr Putin could be laying the ground to claim he was pulling his forces out when he was forced into action against his will.It is a little too soon to declare the crisis over yet.More from NewsPolitics latest news: \u0026#39Of course\u0026#39 I can fight and win the next election, insists Boris JohnsonRussia-Ukraine crisis: Boris Johnson welcomes diplomacy but says \u0026#39intelligence still not encouraging\u0026#39Matt Hancock failed to comply with equality duty over Dido Harding appointment, High Court rulesChina\u0026#39s Olympics have been a catastrophic failureQueen gets back to work after Covid scareWe should not entertain Nato membership for UkraineMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"housing local connection tests could","story":"Housing local connection tests could be scrapped for victims of domestic abuseThe Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities has launched a consultation which will consider scrapping the tests. Currently victims need a local connection in order to apply for emergency housing in an area.Dundee City Council has been recognised for its support for domestic abuse victims. Image: Getty Images EyeEmByAletha AduPolitical Correspondent:,  Feb |commentsDomestic abuse victims could soon be able to choose where they rebuild their lives under new plans, the Government has announced. Currently, victims of abuse need a local connection to an area before they can apply for emergency social housing. This can often mean victims are forced to live in the same communities as their abuser and are denied a fresh start in a new town. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities has launched a consultation launched today which will consider removing the Local Connection Tests. Nicole Jacobs, Domestic Abuse Commissioner for England and Wales said: “For victims and survivors of domestic abuse, home is often the most dangerous place.  “It is vital that victims and survivors can access safe housing regardless of their tenure type. That means staying safely in their own homethey want to, as well as being able to access housing in a new areathey are no longer safe where they live. The DLHC also proposes an extra £million to councils across England to ensure refuges can provide victims with vital support services. Rough Sleeping and Housing Minister Eddie Hughes MP said: “This funding will give victims of domestic abuse and their children across the country the practical and emotional support to recover and rebuild their lives from this terrible crime. “The consultations we are launching today build on this work and will help us give victims more options to move forward with their lives in the way that is right for them.” A second consultation will consider whether and how to change current rules that make it dficult for victims to remove their perpetrators from joint tenancies, which can mean victims either feel forced to stay in their home or are at risk of being made homeless by their abuser.  The government will call on people with experience of domestic abuse and those working in the sector to share their views. It follows official figures that revealed domestic abuse was the second most common reason Brits found themselves homeless. Homelessness due to domestic abuse has risen by .% from July to September . And itaposs up .% from autumn  to the same period in . Homelessness legislation requires local authorities to take “reasonable steps” to try to prevent or relieve a household’s homelessness by helping them to secure accommodation for at least six months. These duties usually last  days each.

But despite some surveys putting the party  points ahead of the Conservatives, ask any Labour MP or activist about the next general election, or even Mayaposs town hall elections, and the responses err more on the side of caution than optimism. Here are some of the things they fear could put a spanner in the works in the months ahead.  . A new Tory Prime Minister Boris Johnson was once the Heineken Tory with widespread appeal in Labouraposs heartlands, but today the opposition would rather be facing the damaged premier than anyone  on the Government benches. Few Tory MPs truly believe the PM is still a vote-winner and there is therefore a good chance he will be ousted before the next election. Who replaces Mr Johnson, and their strategy for rehabilitating the Toriesapos chances, will present a fork in the road for Sir Keir.  Labour insiders say another Tory leadership race - their third in six years - will prove isive but a new PM will mean the opposition has to fight harder to get heard. The frontrunner to take over is Rishi Sunak, the billionaire Chancellor with a slick PR operation who has won praise for the furlough scheme and his handling of Covid.But while the economy became Labouraposs weak spot during the Jeremy Corbyn years, some within Labour point out billions from the public purse lost to Covid fraudsters, sky high inflation and the looming cost of living crisis will be damaging for a politician at the helm of the Treasury should he win the leadership. One source said Labour strategists were less confident about facing Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who they see as potentially dangerous due to her knack for communication.But a former advisor painted a dferent picture, singling out Health Secretary Sajid Javid and dark horse of the contest Penny Mordaunt as greater threats.I think that Iaposd be most worried about Sajid Javid, followed by Penny Mordaunt, followed by Rishi Sunak, they said.Rishi Sunak is a much feebler a politician than people think. The only time when heaposs shown real deftness and popularity is when heaposs spending gigantic amounts of money and being a Chancellor that can spend money is like playing FIFA on the easiest mode. . Money woesThe Labour Party faces a major cash crisis.Messy legal wrangles costing as much as £m-a-year, a fall in membership since Jeremy Corbynaposs exit, reduced funding from some trade unions and three general elections in six years have been punishing for the partyaposs finances.This forced General Secretary David Evans into a cost-cutting drive last year, slashing around  jobs. Insiders say this has been a painful process that has left the party with fewer advisors, press officers and officials as chiefs look ahead to town hall elections and a possible snap general election before . Sources boast the party is winning over donors who previously filled Lib Dem and Tory coffers, but nevertheless expect the Conservatives to vastly outspend them in Mayaposs local elections in an era when flooding Facebook and other social media with ads is critical.Any decision by Unite to slash its funding, with the union having already cutback its donations, will worry party chiefs.. Internal warfare Endless column inches have been filled by commentators poring over the rivalry between Sir Keir and his Deputy Leader, Angela Rayner.Much less has been written about growing tensions between the leadership and the partyaposs Left. Train driversapos union Aslef could vote to disaffiliate in May, a move which would see them follow in the footsteps of the bakersapos union BFAWU. While some moderates see the moves as a necessary break with the Jeremy Corbyn era, others fear historic links are being broken and that isions may in turn see rows spill into the media spotlight. Labouraposs bigger concern is with one of its biggest donors: Unite. General Secretary Sharon Graham, who leads a union of around .m members, became embroiled in a row with Sir Keir over funding last week, as she voiced anger over Labouraposs lack of support for striking bin workers in Coventry. While Sir Keir is known to have more allies within health union Unison, GMB and Usdaw, the rt with Unite - the union with most members working in the private sector - could turn sour and with far reaching consequences for party unity.  One source insisted: Of course there are disagreements - thataposs happened throughout the party history and we will work them out like the family we are, but we wonapost be pushed around by bully boy tactics. The Labour leader is keen to define himself against other elements of the Left, however. He used a demo by the Stop The War coalition last week to point out, as he has before, that he disagrees with Jeremy Corbyn on the NATO alliance. Conflict claries for voters where you stand. Itaposs through conflict that people can process the information that they need to understand who you are, said one source. And heaposs picking fights more often, in a way that demonstrates some strength but also shows a bit more about who he really is. Labouraposs ruling body has rejected calls to readmit Jeremy Corbyn as a Labour MP after he lost the whip Reports continue to surface that Mr Corbyn is planning to set up his own party. Opinion is ided over whether an attention-grabbing and widely covered exit of the Islington North MP will offer Sir Keir a chance to slay the partyaposs demons or simply remind Red Wall voters of the not-too-distant past, and his own link to it. Other flashpoints include the ongoing rows with some female MPs, including Rosie Duffield, over the partyaposs position on trans rights, with the Canterbury MP saying recently she considered defecting over the issue. . Local elections Labour currently holds about % of the seats up for grabs in May and insiders talk down prospects of signicant gains in terms of the raw number of councillors. The party hopes Labouraposs overall vote share will compare favourably with the % Jeremy Corbyn won, and give Sir Keir a story to tell both to the public and his own internal critics.  Pollsters are tipping the party to do well in London, with the Tory strongholds of Wandsworth, Westminster and Barnet said to be in Sir Keiraposs sights. How Labour fares in Red Wall areas such as Sunderland, where the Leader spent yesterday campaigning, Bolton and Stockport, however, is key. It is feared a failure to show progress here could allow a narrative to develop that Labour is a metropolitan or London-centric party. . Immigration policy It is thought Sir Keir is planning to bring policies on hot potato issues - including defence and immigration - to Labouraposs autumn conference, with explosive rows likely to ensue with the partyaposs rank and file. Sources say the partyaposs new ideas on controlling immigration could even be announced before summer, by Sir Keir rather than Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. “We’re going to have to have a row”, one party source said of the partyaposs conference. “We’re working on the basis that we need to be election ready by May . “That means a lot of the policy groundwork will have to be taken into conference before the end of the year.”Even before Brexit, immigration was a thorny issue for Labour. The party continues to enjoy strong backing among Remainers, but senior figures know they must answer the concerns of Red Wall voters who turned their back on them in .How Labouraposs policy brains square this circle, without running the risk of the party haemorrhaging support to Greens and Lib Dems, will be one to watch.

Race equality thinktank the Runnymede Trust was granted the declaration by Lord Justice Singh and Mr Justice Swt after a High Court hearing in December. The Good Law Project joined the Runnymede Trust in the action. The judges ruled that the Runnymede Trust had sufficient standing to bring a public sector equality duty challenge but GLP did not.The ruling centred on Mr Hancockaposs decision to appoint Baroness Harding as interim executive chair of the National Institute for Health Protection in August  and ex-Sainsburyaposs boss Mr Coupe as director of testing for NHS Test and Trace in September . Lawyers representing the two organisations suggested that people outside the tight circle in which senior Conservative politicians and their friends moved were not being given opportunities. They said an unfair policy was being challenged. Ministers disputed the claims made against them. Jason Coppel QC, who led the two organisationsapos legal teams, told Lord Justice Singh and Mr Justice Swt that the challenge was based on equality legislation and public law. He said the Government had a policy or practice of making appointments to posts critical to the pandemic response without adopting any, or any sufficient, fair or open competitive processes. Mr Coppel said people less likely to be known or connected to decision-makers were put at a disadvantage. He also said the Government was failing to offer remuneration for high-level full-time roles and excluding all candidates who were not already wealthy or held other posts for which they would continue to be paid.  Lord Justice Singh and Mr Justice Swt said in a written ruling: It is the process leading up to the two decisions which has been found by this court to be in breach of the public sector equality duty. For those reasons we will grant a declaration to the Runnymede Trust that the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care did not comply with the public sector equality duty in relation to the decisions how to appoint Baroness Harding as interim executive chair of the NIHP in August  and Mr Coupe as director of testing for NHSTT in September . Dr Halima Begum, Chief Executive of the Runnymede Trust, welcomed the findings. She said: “The judgement handed down today by the High Court is incredibly signicant to the British people. It shows the importance of the Public Sector Equality Duty and its role in protecting the people of this nation from the closed shop of Government appointments, not least in a time of national crisis where people from our minority communities were dying from Covid in hugely disproportionate numbers. Mr Hancock’s spokesman said the High Court ruling “states that aposthe evidence provides no support ... at allapos for the allegation that Dido Harding secured senior positions on the basis of apospersonal or political connectionsapos in the Government”. The judges accepted “these aposwere urgent recruitment processes which needed to find highly-specialised, experienced and available candidates within a short space of timeapos”, according to the spokesman. He went on: Letaposs not forget, we were dealing with an unprecedented global pandemic where time was of the essence in order to protect and save lives. Mr Hancock resigned as Health Secretary last year after admitting to breaching his own Covid guidelines by kissing an aide in his office.

Boris Johnson will chair an emergency COBR meeting today after he cut short a UK tour to deal with the Ukraine crisis. The Prime Minister spoke to US President Joe Biden on Monday night, when both leaders agreed there was a crucial window for diplomacy but the threat of Russian aggression remained serious.More than , Russian troops are massed on the Ukrainian borders. But some units started toto their bases on Tuesday morning, offering a glimmer of hope for a diplomatic solution.  Ms Truss said Europe was teetering on the brink of war and time was running out to find a diplomatic solution. And she said the crisis could embolden other countries with military ambitions. The senior Tory told Sky News: If we saw an invasion into Ukraine, there would be severe costs in terms of a long-running conflict, we could see the undermining of security more broadly in Europe and could see other aggressors around the world see it as an opportunity to expand their ambitions too. This is a very dangerous moment for the world. Ms Truss said the stability of Europe was hanging in the balance. The big risk, of course, isthere is an invasion into Ukraine that will be hugely damaging for Russia and Ukraine. And it will further undermine the stability of Europe, she said. This, I fear, would not stop at Ukraine. This is an attack on the neighbouring states of Russia and other east European countries in trying to undermine legitimacy of them being part of NATO.  She said she was very worried about the situation, adding: We could be on the brink of a war in Europe, which would have severe consequences not just for the people of Russia and Ukraine, but also for the broader security of Europe. There is still time for Vladimir Putin to step away from the brink. But there is only a limited amount of time for him to do that. Mr Putin and his foreign minister Sergei Lavrov have agreed to continue down the path of negotiations, prompting hopes that there could still be a way to avert war. A Downing Street source said there was some hope that diplomacy could work and Russia could step back.

The kids in the class had drawn pictures of their beloved parents and hung them in the window - and Wendy instantly knew which picture had been drawn by her eldest child. The mum-of-four, from Canberra in Australia, told news.au she was confronted with a stick figure that had a ginormous belly. Written above the stick figure were the words: Itaposs ok to be fat. Describing the drawing as a slap in the face, Wendy, who weighed more than  stone at the time, said it shook her into action. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here The picture made the -year-old realise she treated her body in an unhealthy way, which was an attitude she didnapost want to pass on to her kids. She said: Growing up, I would restrict myself by eating as little or as light as I could. Avoiding fats and carbs. If I ever ate out I would lose control and spiral into days or weeks of binge eating and as I got older that included binge drinking. She added she had an unhealthy relationship with food, using dferent foods as a punishment versus a reward with an all or nothing attitude to dieting. Looking back on her pregnancies, Wendy said she took the eating for two mantra a little too literally, meaning she piled on the pounds each time.  The self-confessed yo-yo dieter said her weight really hit home when she was pregnant with her youngest and you couldnapost really tell she was carrying a child. So in  Wendy signed up to her local gym and started going to group fitness classes, dropping her kids off at the nursery while she exercised. “I hired a personal trainer and together we focused on nutrition and exercise. I soon discovered I really enjoyed lting weights and for the first time I actually started to see changes in my body,” she said. After getting the bug for weightlting, Wendy began training for the World Beauty Fitness and Fashion modelling competition, with the aim to compete in the Transformation category. She teamed up with three-time WBFF champion and nutritionist Alicia Gowans, who coached her on her journey. Wendy said Alicia helped her tackle many years of self-abuse and self-neglect, opening her up again to new opportunities. Through her training, Wendy claims she got to know herself better and realised what she needed to do to change her patterns. For Wendy, it was no longer about losing weight, but improving her health - for her childrenaposs sake. While she trains for the competition on  April, Wendy does four weight-based workouts per week. She follows a nutritional plan which aids her training and makes sure she gets a restful sleep. She also walks between , and , steps every day - mainly by running around after her kids.Have you had an incredible body transformation  We pay for stories.

After racking her brain to find ways of earning more cash to make ends meet, Tilly decided to do some research into escorting. From there, Tilly decided to try out a new career - and sheaposs never looked back. Over the last nine years, Tilly has worked as a private escort, in massage parlours and in brothels. Tilly, who is gay, told news.au she never had much trouble settling into sex work, because sleeping with men was easy for her. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Describing how men can climax more easily than women, the Sydney-based worker added having sex with a man was a piece of cake. Although sheaposs now a veteran of the sex industry and can manage clients much better than when she was younger, Tilly admits sheaposs suffered from classic millennial burnout. She added the job has made her far more celibate in her private le, and she only seeks out sex with a proper emotional connection, rather than endless dating or casual sex.  Although she is often getting down and dirty at work, she says most of the sex isnapost good sex but admits sometimes it can be fun. Tilly says her work has never interfered with her personal relationships - mainly because the women she has dated donapost feel threatened by the men she has sex with for work. She claims the only time she butted heads with a partner over her work was when the partner was also working in the sex industry.  If we were working the same sht and I was getting picked by more guys, she would pick a fight with me because she was upset that I was getting picked more than her,” she said. While working in the industry, Tilly has used her social media accounts to try and bust myths about sex work and remove the stigma. She has also released a novel, Nothing But My Body, which is also about a sex worker. But while some aspects of the novel draw upon her own experiences, Tilly is keen to stress the book is a novel rather than a memoir. She said: I wanted the actual topics that the character is interrogating to be romantic love, and mental health, and queer community, and what it means to create a family and friendship and all that kind of stuff. I didn’t actually want sex work to be the problem topic.Do you have a real le story to share  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcShe added the important theme of friendship in the LGBT+ community runs through the book, which she argues is key for queer people who have turned to friends for support when their families havenapost accepted them.

The parent, from Reading, Berkshire, said: Charlie was completely fine that morning and started crying as he always did as he didn’t like the car seat, but very quickly his cry sounded very strange and when I looked down he wasn’t breathing.  “I got him out of the seat quickly and at that point, he was grey and floppy. Initially, I panicked as blood then began coming out of his nose and, honestly, I thought he was gone.”Lauraaposs instincts took over and, having completed a baby first aid course during her pregnancy, she was able to lay Charlie down and begin rescue breaths.She was supported by a  call handler as they waited for paramedics from South Central Ambulance Serviceto arrive. Laura, a children’s speech and language therapist, said: “The operator told me the crew would arrive as quickly as possible as he was a category one emergency. “I remember Charlie started breathing slowly on his own, so I held him in the baby recovery position so the blood didn’t go into his airway and I remember the operator talking me through things and telling me that Charlie could hear me and to reassure him.  Within six minutes, paramedics and a crew from Thames Valley Air Ambulancearrived and took over, helping to stabilise Charlie. He was transferred and he went to resuscitation and was put on a ventilator, with Laura joined by partner and Charlie’s father Adam Green, , who rushed from work straight to the hospital. Charlie was then taken by another ambulance to the paediatric intensive care unit at the John Radclfe Hospital in Oxford where he stayed for a week.

Laura said: “We don’t fully know what caused this to happen as it was just out of the blue and all his tests subsequently were clear, though clinicians suspected there was a possibility he may have had some blood in his airway or lungs. “Thanks to the quick arrival and excellent care provided by SCAS and TVAA, as well as the hospital care he received, Charlie made a complete recovery and has no developmental problems. “He is a bright, happy, sociable three-and-a-half-year-old who loves riding his bike, swimming and anything to do with cars – we are so proud of him every single day and remain so grateful for the excellent care he received.” Laura and Adam, a quantity surveyor wanted to take on a fundraising challenge to thank the ambulance staff who helped.

Although the weather report made a brief TV appearance in November , the pre-war audience was tiny as so few homes had a television set.However, it made itsto TV in , using a map with captions to illustrate the forecast.Magnetic symbolsThe magnetic symbols used for many years will always have a place in some people’s hearts. Although they were designed to give a more precise indication of what to expect and where, they frequently went wonky or fell off maps during broadcasts. By  the symbols were replaced when the world’s most advanced computerised weather display system came into operation at the BBC.  First weatherman Former RAF forecaster George Cowling was the first forecaster to appear in vision standing before a map. On January , , the -year-old set the tone for his five-minute broadcasts, which aimed to stress continuity. He also believed that he should deliver one that “the man in the street” would understand. During his debut, he introduced a personal touch, saying tomorrow would be good for drying washing. George left the BBC in  and died in .  Britain paralysed The amount of snow that blanketed the country in  was the last thing people needed while trying to recover from the Second World War. The BBC reported drts ft deep which paralysed the nation. Roads and railways were blocked. Workers, including miners, were trapped at home and at one point London had less than a week’s worth of coal left in its stocks. Meanwhile, farmers were unable to reach their livestock and animals starved to death. When the thaw finally came in March it created floods. Great storm of The massive storm was described by the Met Office as a “once in -year” event. With winds gusting up to mph, it was estimated that well over million trees were blown down across England and Wales, including six of the giant trees in Sevenoaks that gave the town its name.Radio and TV weather forecasts were limited then but lessons were certainly learned on how to improve and communicate a forecast. To this day, people still talk about the storm and refer to it as the “Michael Fish hurricane”, largely because the night before the event the BBC weatherman, left, had promised the nation there would not be a hurricane. The storm also brought about the inception of weather warnings, to help deliver the forecast of dangerous conditions more clearly.  Hottest day July , , was a scorcher. In fact, it was the hottest day ever recorded in the UK. The BBC told how the weather station at the University of Cambridge Botanic Garden recorded .C, beating the UK record of .C set in Faversham, Kent, in . Staff working at the garden tweeted: “No wonder we all felt aswe’d melted.” First female broadcaster Barbara Edwards was the first female forecaster on BBC TV. She made her small screen debut in  and fronted broadcasts until . As a qualied meteorologist, who had joined the Met Office in , Barbara blazed a trail. But she found the level of scrutiny about her appearance tough and later said: “Privacy just goes out the window. I just couldn’t accept that.” In , she revealed that she had been working part-time in a university library.

On February , , a record low of -C was recorded and BBC News reported: “By the time this blizzard had finally blown itself out,  main roads were impassable and , miles of road were snowbound.”  Name that storm You might remember the  St Jude storm but, in fact, the name was not given by the Met Office. It was coined by the media. The names given to it by EU meteorological institutions were Christian or Carmen.However, in September  the Met Office, along with their Irish counterparts Met Éireann, began naming storms– and the BBC quickly adopted the convention. The first storm that year was Abigail on November -, and a total of  were named over the - season. Later, the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute decided to adopt the same system and now joins the UK and Ireland to help name storms.

If you sell goods to the EU, or buy goods from the EU and bring them into the UK, you need to be able to prove that they meet the new rules of origin requirements to access preferential tarfs. It’s vital you understand the new rules to keep your business moving. To benefit from the preferential tarfs, you must have proof that any goods you import from the EU originate there, or any goods you export to the EU originate in the UK. Proof of origin can either be a statement of origin completed by the exporter, or evidence of the importer’s knowledge of where products originate. If you cannot prove the origin, you or your EU customer may be liable to pay the full rate of customs duty and could face penalties. Andrew Macleod, founder of London-based restaurant brand Emilia’s Crafted Pasta, explains that imports from the EU are vital to his brand: “We import ingredients directly from Italy, including special cured meats, cheeses, drinks and alcohol. Each of our suppliers is hand-picked.”  Has he had to make any changes to his business now that there are new import rules in place  “Yes – of course we already knew the origin of all the goods we import as we source everything carefully. But we’ve trained two of our managers on the rules around importing, so we know that we have staff in house who are well versed in the process.”  And having successfully navigated the changes, what advice would Andrew offer other businesses that import  “We found using a customs agent really helps the process run smoothly, but it’s equally important that you understand the rules yourself,” he says. “It’s not too late, and the gov.uk site has lots of valuable information.”  You must be able to prove the origin of any product you import You can choose to work with a freight forwarder or courier To benefit from preferential tarfs, you must be able to prove that any goods you import originated in the EU Note:you’re moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, rules of origin work dferently.

But because of her failure to abide by it, she now faces a day at Kirklees Magistratesapos Court next month. A witness statement from one resident says: The noise from the crowing cockerels has affected and continues to affect our daily le.  This is not just a single bird crowing occasionally, they said. Typically, once one starts other birds join in with almost continual crowing either simultaneously or consecutively.Depending on the season and weather we have had our sleep disturbed often as early as am or earlier, every day of the week including weekends.In addition, frequently the crowing would continue into the late evening. With such disturbance to our health has been affected as well as disturbing and spoiling any enjoyment we might have in being outside in our garden. More so in summer when doors and windows are typically open the noise also infiltrates the house. Almost three years ago, early , we started to be woken up in the early morning by the sound of cockerels crowing. As this carried on we discovered the birds were housed a short distance away. The birds are in a direct line to, and almost at the same height as our bedroom window, around m away. Over time the number of birds kept has been increased exacerbating the issue. We believe that at least six cockerels have been kept and possibly  or more since . It is almost three years since the problem started and our first complaint was made to Kirklees Council in . Jess, who has a background in animal welfare, said: I love these cockerels. I donapost have children so these animals are like my aposbabiesapos. Obviously, it is not nice when you are being woken up but this is a semi-rural area and I rent the land from a local farmer. I was mad when I found out there had been a complaint. I would have liked the person concerned to have come to me personally instead of complaining via the council. I have had anti-crow collars fitted to the cockerelsapos throats which tighten their passages and dull the sound and I think that has made a dference. I have done that on all of them but it works better on some of them than others. The council wants me to put them in a dark box but I think that is cruel.She has now set up a GoFundMe page outlining her plight and asking for people to help her raise hundreds of pounds so she can be defended by a solicitor in court.In it, she pleads: I myself suffer from anxiety, of which keeping my chickens, , helps massively with this.

But a Manchester University study has shown it’s a ­relatively small group of patients who have been piling on additional pressure at surgeries. These “frequent attenders” account for a large proportion of a GP’s ­workload – % of appointments, including ­face-to-face consultations. The findings go some way to explain why it’s so hard to see a GP. Frequent attenders – classed as people having more appointments than % of patients at their practice, have more than doubled their number of clinic visits in the last two decades. The study ran from - and looked at million consultations from .million patients in  ­GP practices. It showed four out of  patients were frequent attenders. Co-author Dr Maria Panagioti, from Manchester University, said: “Frequent attenders also may have special health and social care needs but for a iety of reasons we do not yet fully ­understand how best to meet them.”Consultations with GPs by frequent attenders increased from an average of  in  to  in . But when consultations with other staff at GP clinics, such as nurses, were added in, the average figure more than doubled from  to . To cope with more requests for appointments GPs are using a iety of means, including non-face-to-face, such as telephone and online. It seems the traditional way of patients seeing GPs is being replaced by a new working model where other staff members are using dferent ways simply to cope with workloads. Co-author Professor Evan ­Kontopantelis from Manchester University, said: “This is the first study to show that frequent attenders, the top % of consulters, have largely and progressively contributed to increased workload in general ­practices across the UK over the last  years.” Co-author Professor Aneez Esmail, also from Manchester University, said: “Our findings show frequent attenders account for an increasing proportion of face-to-face consultations with GPs and are responsible for nearly % of consultations fairly constantly over time.” Dr Panagioti added: “But these ­findings may also suggest the increase in multi-disciplinary staff working in general practices is perhaps the only solution for sustaining primary care. “Indeed, the large increase in the general practice workload over the last  years means having extended multidisciplinary teams is necessary to meet a wide range of patient needs through a range of ways such as remote consultations.” Sounds like general practice will never be the same.

It seems surreal, we couldnapost really believe it. Everyone at the club is devastated.  I just want to send our best wishes out to his family and I hope theyaposre ok. He had been coming to the club since we opened in July. He would come two to three times a week. He had a lot of promise. I want to send our condolences to the family.

In , the then -year-old decided to start clearing her wardrobe and put old outfits on Depop to sell in a bid to make some spare cash. The app lets people buy and sell unwanted outfits and has revolutionised the second-hand clothing market - and helped savvy sellers make thousands. Living in Cardf, Hollie started casually using the app after getting super bored of the clothing she had - but now nets her earns a six-figure salary after becoming a top seller. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Now living in Bali, the -year-old law graduate, who was born in London, has hired five people to help her run her shops in the UK. She told the Mirror: I’d started trying to lose weight in  and by  I’d dropped about  dress sizes so I needed to get rid of my old stuff and also buy myself clothes that fit. It was a godsend for making pocket money whilst I was doing my degree because I honestly would not have been able to afford to buy clothes otherwise. It wasn’t until the end of  though that I really started to put the work in and try to build out some brands.Hollie now sells a range of items from jewellery to designer menaposs clothes and handed her notice in at her job in June  to work on her shops full-time. She said: I went to Dubai in February  for a month and funnily enough I haven’t been back to the UK since. I think by June I was handing my notice in, I’d been able to scale my shops to a point where I didn’t need to sacrice my hours between - every day and there’s nothing more motivating than the sun outside to make you get off your butt and try and make something of your le. I still one hundred per cent will one day finish my training and become a lawyer but I would love to be able to scale my shops to the point where I can work pro-bono. From Bali, she keeps in touch with the five people in the UK who help manage the manual labour of sending out packages. Describing her day-to-day, she said: I adopted an incredibly cheeky Bali dog after a few months of living here so she wakes up at about  or  every day. I check in with the people who are doing the manual labour for my shops in the UK to make sure everything went smoothly that day as there’s an eight hour time dference. Then I’ll find a cute cafe to work in and spend a few hours checking my inventories and seeingI need to restock anything. I also check any new Depop trends to make sure I’m up to date and then I make some TikToks for the week. At lunchtime, I go home, go to the gym and then sunbathe until people in the UK are awake. At this point, I’ll record some videos for Instagram with my daily Depop tips and then I’m done with work for the day. In the past seven years, Hollie has made thousands each year from her side hustle - but almost lost it in  when her shops were hacked. I can tell you that on average I make [between] five to ten times what I used to earn in a month, she added. I was quite surprised that my shops have taken off so much but I have a lot more outgoings now that I’ve outsourced my work to other people. I’ve come a long way from living off Lidl p pasta!  Last year, she wrote an e-book last year designed to allow people to fast-track success on Depop, detailing how she built and scales my businesses to the point where she could quit my job.For those keen to sell their own clothes, she advises: Most importantly - do your RESEARCH. I can’t explain the amount of money I lost buying random things to sell and having none of it sell. I always tell people that their starting capital is in their wardrobe but honestly it is. Declutter your wardrobe and shop sustainably, this is the future!For any further tips, follow Hollie on Instagram and TikTok @hollieamc.

From March new cars will be have the “” registration tag and then in September number plates will have a  until February , .The number plates will have to now include the supplier’s business name and postcode, along with the name of the number plate manufacturer and the new standard. They will also follow the  new rules which meant that they will be “BS AU e” standard plates which meet the new British Standard for Retroreflective Number Plates. The plates are made from a tougher material which makes them more resistant to abrasion and other damage. Number plates can now only display solid black lettering as two tone plates that used dferent shades to create a D or D effect have been banned, reported the Express.The lettering can still be Perspex or acrylic lettering, provided it meets all other requirements. This change was made to make it easier for Automatic Number Plate Recognitioncameras to read the plate. The alterations to number plates will also have an impact on pricing for vehicles and anyone opting for a car without the latest the  number could get a bargain. Car dealerships are known to get rid of old stock at discounted prices in February and August. At the same time the AA Financial Services found that more than one in three drivers plan on changing their car this year.  Less than half of those surveyed said they would prefer to buy a car by paying the full asking price, instead of opting for shorter-term finance solutions. James Fairclough, CEO of AA Financial Services, commented on the car market in . He said: “The promise of fresh car demand in  is welcome news, following a challenging year for the car industry. “The impact of Covid and the global shortage of semi-conductors has seriously impacted new car registrations this year, pushing up demand for used cars. “Previous AA research suggested that values of some used cars have risen by up to  percent.  “What we expect to see in  is the second-hand market benefitting from resurgent car demand. “We also believe the way people pay for their cars will change and ersy. “The economic uncertainty of Covid and the transition to electric cars will continue to influence drivers until the traditional notion of paying full-price for a car and keeping it for as long as possible is something for the history books.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Cars\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It is moving to the site of the societyaposs wildle park, the Wild Place Project, in south Gloucestershire. Since it first opened, the zoo has received an estimated  million visitors and helped save  species from extinction through its conservation programmes. The decision to sell the site was announced after the second national lockdown in England, after the zoo had already missed out on revenue from the peak spring and summer months.  The zoo had already been struggling with declining visitor numbers before the pandemic hit, with the organisation having made an operating loss in four out of the past six years. The Bristol Zoological Society has planned a number of events ahead of the closing date for people to share their memories of the site, which will be announced over the coming weeks. Dr Justin Morris, the societyaposs chief executive, said: Bristol Zoo Gardens is a special place for so many people and we want to give them a chance to come, to see our animals and the gardens and to talk about their memories.  After the move, parts of the site are due to be developed into housing, with the gardens themselves to be open to the public free of charge. The childrenaposs play area and theatre building will also be kept open as a community space for workshops and events. The famous monkey temple will also be left standing, while the zooaposs entrance will be transformed into the Clton Conservation Hub hosting the Avon Gorge and Downs Wildle Project.  Dr Morris said: This is our legacy. Our way of guaranteeing that people throughout the Bristol area will still be able to enjoy the gardens for generations to come.

Andrew has denied Virginia Giuffre’s claims in a US court. According to a report in the i newspaper, Prince Andrew’s legal team will hope to find a way of discounting the photograph as credible evidence, reports the Independent.Prince Andrew claims he has no recollection of the photograph being taken.

She refuses to abandon him.”Princess Eugenie is reportedly good friends with Meghan Markle, whom she met before Prince Harry had been introduced to his now-we. The Prince has only ed to the UK twice since he left in . The last time he ed to the county was in , when he and Prince William unveiled the statue of their late mother Princess Diana at Kensington Palace.He also ed in April last year for the funeral of his late grandfather Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh.Both times he stayed with Princess Eugenie at Frogmore Cottage in the grounds of Windsor Castle, where he and we Meghan moved before they married in .

Brits could feel the impact of Storm Dudley sooner than thought after forecasters moved forward the warning period. The storm, which carries a danger to le weather warning, will likely start and finish earlier than expected, according to the Met Office.Gusts of up to mph are set to batter the whole of the country due to a jet stream which was originally forecast to hit on Wednesday and Thursday under a yellow weather warning.  But this has now been upgraded to a more severe amber warning bringing le-threatening gales to parts of Northern Ireland, most of Scotland and the north of England. This is set to reduce to a yellow wind warning by Thursday - after which Storm Eunice will bring strong winds and potentially snow to parts of the country on Friday.  The Met Office said very strong and disruptive winds are expected for the area with the risk of fallen trees, power cuts and transport delays and cancellations. Weather experts are also warning of injuries and danger to le from large waves and beach material being thrown onto coastal roads, sea fronts and homes. Yellow wind warnings are in place for the rest of Northern Ireland and northern England, central Scotland and the Midlands on Wednesday and Thursday. Storm Dudley is set to bluster its way southward with a yellow wind warning in place for southern Scotland and the rest of the UK. A Met Office spokesperson said: There is a small chance that flying debris will result in a danger to le, with fallen trees, damage to buildings and homes, roofs blown off and power lines brought down.  There is also a small risk of injury and danger to le from large waves along the coast. Residents are urged to secure loose items outdoors, shut doors and windows, park vehicles in a garage where possible, and stay indoors during the storm as much as possible. There are no UK weather warnings in place from Saturday onwards.

Leanne Jones, , told how her sister became stranded and was rescued by the fire service who were unable to capture the bird.She then hired a cherry picker herself before going up in a bid to try and save the parrot. Detailing the incident Leanne said she was eating lunch with her baby macaw Missy last Friday when it flew away into a tree. She stayed outside with the bird all night waiting for her to come down but instead in the morning it flew into another tree.  Her sister Toni-Anne, , tried to scale the tree in Trowbridge, but got stuck. Leanne said: My sister is a bit like Houdini, and I was like, aposuh do you think you can try and get up this tree  It was so windy - she was like, aposIaposm stuck!aposDorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue received a call at :am and sent rescue crews from Trowbridge and Chippenham.They called for one fire engine from Warminster and Devizes equipped with a m ladder so they could reach Toni-Anne and help her down.  Sadly, the crews were not able to retrieve the bird - so foster carer Leanne paid £ to hire a cherry picker and go up herself. She said: Iaposm absolutely terried of heights, but I didnapost want to risk her flying off. She didnapost budge, she let me pick her up and and was kissing all over my face. She was freezing cold and very hungry but she was fine. Leanne, a mum of four, had just got Missy who was only  weeks old. She said: She hadnapost flown before and so it was completely my fault. I was sat in the garden having lunch with her and she was just sat on the table with me, pinching bit of lunch off my nephewaposs plate. She was just eating blueberries and bananas and she was flapping her wings as parrots do, and then she just took off. Leanne continued: I was trying to call her down she had loads of seagulls flying around, I think she was like aposoh my gosh, whataposs going on apos  She couldnapost figure out how to swoop down so went in a circle, she was bullied a bit by seagulls and went over my house by my garden. By the time Iaposd got round the back I didnapost know where she was. Eventually they found the blue and yellow bird in Trowbridge Lodge Park in a tree in a garden and after spending the night waiting for the bird to come down she then flew to another tree. This was when Toni-Anne thought she could give it a try, but unfortunately got stuck and had to be rescued by Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue. The fire crews were not able to rescue the bird, and the RSPB couldnapost help until after  hours, but Leanne didnapost want to wait a moment longer and hired a cherry picker for £. Terried of heights, Leanne then made her way up the tree where Missy allowed her to pick her up and take her to safety. She said: I was shaking like a leaf getting down! It really is amazing, so many people out looking for Missy, so many people were offering to help and turning up with poles. Donapost assume a baby parrot canapost fly! A statement from Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue said: We of course understand the emotional attachments to pets of any species, but please take this incident as a reminder of the danger posed by attempting to rescue without any specialist assistance.

The FBI last month confirmed that killer Laundrie admitted murdering his partner Gabby in a notepad found next to his body.The -year-old took his own le as a massive manhunt was launched following Gabbyaposs death. Laundrieaposs body was discovered at the Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park in Florida on October . According to the autopsy report, personal items belonging to Laundrie were found at the scene of his remains. This included a pair of green shorts with a green belt, two slip-on shoes, a backpack with unknown contents, a white metal ring, and a handgun.  The apossecondaryapos scene contained skeletal animal remains, a handwritten half note, and a hat with the logo aposMOAB Coffee Roasters,apos the report says. A bag found by Laundrieaposs dad reportedly contained a journal, a notebook and a photo of Laundrie, as well as other photos. A backpack with a tent - which was not set up - was also reportedly found. Laundrie disappeared after ing from a cross-country road trip without his partner Gabby and was the lone suspect in her death.  Her body had been found in a remote area in Wyoming on September , and a post-mortem confirmed she had been strangled. In a statement wrapping up its investigation the FBI said: “A review of the notebook revealed written statements by Mr Laundrie claiming responsibility for Ms Petito’s death.” Petito family attorney Richard Stafford praised investigators for their “diligent and painstaking efforts in this extremely complicated case”. He said in a statement: “The quality and quantity of the facts and information collected by the FBI leave no doubt that Brian Laundrie murdered Gabby.”  A backpack and notepad belonging to Laundrie was found near his body and although the corpse had been scavenged by alligators and wild pigs, an examination of dental records proved conclusively that it was him. The Laundrie family’s attorney Steve Bertolino said in a statement to E! News after the discovery: Chris and Roberta Laundrie have been informed that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and the manner of death was suicide. Chris and Roberta are still mourning the loss of their son and are hopeful that these findings bring closure to both families.

She told her auntie to use it up on her own dog to save her the trouble of having to cart it back to her own house.But, months later, the raw dog food was still sealed up in a bag in the freezer. That was until her -year-old grandma decided to cook a meal for two, using what she thought was frozen minced meat.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.  The woman said: “My granny decided to cook and thought my auntie put that food there - and she used it up since it had been in there for some time. “She sliced up some ginger, garlic and all the usual Chinese sauces, served it with rice and some bok choy.” It wasn’t until the sisters paid their next visit when they realised what had happened. “When we went to visit, my auntie told my sister they ate the meat she left there because they thought it would go bad - and that it tasted kind of bland,” she added. “After some confusion, my sister remembered and that was the day my granny and auntie ate dog food.” It is unknown whether the pair admitted the truth to their grandma and auntie - or whether it has become a family secret. However, they have been reassured by other users who have confessed to similar things happening within their own households. One user admitted: “I ate puppy treats and role played as a dog when I was a kid.” While another user said: “My grandfather-in-law actually ate dog snacks. We found him in the kitchen eating some and we told him what it was and he thought they were good anyway.

After a few moments rling through the shirts to work out where the webs were coming from, Ellen then spotted what appeared to be a huge black widow spider. The poisonous species can be identied by a red dot on its body. Ellen filmed a TikTok video of the creepy find, where it quickly went viral after gaining more than eight million views.In it, she can be heard saying: Can we talk about the cobwebs that are literally... What is going on  Did a spider... What  Oh lord, what is that  What is this  In a second clip, another employee takes the piece of clothing outside and shakes it until the spider falls off. She can be heard saying: Please get off my shirt! Eventually, the arachnid fell to the ground and she s, saying, That was so cool. While itaposs unconfirmed what species of spider it was or what store the bug was found in, many who viewed the clips believed it was a black widow.This spideraposs bite venom is reported to be  times stronger than a rattlesnakeaposs. In humans, bites produce muscle aches, nausea, and a paralysis of the diaphragm that can make breathing dficult. However, most people who are bitten suffer no serious damage—let alone death. But bites can be fatal—usually to small children, the elderly, or the infirm.

Amongst these is Beinn Odhar # its southern slopes lying firmly in the county of Stirling, whilst its summit stands proudly in Argyll.If approached from the west, north or south you could keep your toes in Argyll all day. Unless on a round of Corbetts # there are five here that make a fine challenge # it is easier to approach the Corbett via its gentler slopes from Tyndrum. This also gives the opportunity to explore the adit # access tunnel # and old lead mine on its higher slopes where the mineral vein continuation from Sron nan Colan is exposed. The Beinn Odhar lead mining venture appears to have been a short one but the views once the summit is reached are tremendous.Leaving the car park, cross the A and head left passing the Tyndrum Inn, the Green Welly Stop and cross the bridge.Turn right immediately after crossing the bridge to join the West Highland Waynorthwards, passing the KeyStore.You will need to stay on the WHW for the next .km as it slowly climbs out of Tyndrum with the A on your left and the Crom Allton your right until you reach the bridges over the burn and railway.Cross the bridges and go through the gate at the north end. You will be heading up on to the open hillside to your right.You now have a choice. Either head straight up in a north easterly direction picking your own route on the grassy slopes or veer slightly right back to the Crom Allt to pick up a faint path. If you use the latter, ensure you head upwards at around NN. Either way you will tend to end up on sections of the old mining path as it zigs zags upwards by default due to the natural line of the slope.Once you reach m # after approximately .km depending on how direct your route was # the ground becomes stonier. The adit and mine are higher to your left, northwest, on the crest of the ridgeline, whereas the faint path runs just under this soyou want to explore them it is worth scrabbling up the rocks to have a look. The bottom of the adit starts at around ms.Heading up from the adit and mine # or path # the route flattens out, passing a lochan and the county boundary to your left. Ahead, the final ascent is best tackled by heading northeast then northwest to follow the hill’s natural line. There are no particular dficulties.The summit views are fabulous and an excellent panorama of Beinn Dorain can be had from the steep northern slopes above Coire Luaidh.It is easiest todown the southwestern slopes you ascended, but other possibilities could include some of the neighbouring Corbetts, especially the longer days in summer.Safety in the outdoorsThe described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.Whilst every effort is made to ensure the route is accurate at the time of going to print,  please be aware track and path closures can happen at any time.

It would goodit was cut back and trimmed or a fence erected to help deter people. It is not aesthetically pleasing with graffiti along the route. The lighting looked to be sufficient but there was one broken lamp post which will be fixed by SBC. It is also a very lonely path to walk. Therefore, I would also say that some areas would require CCTV as a deterrent and to know that there are eyes watching.”The path is a busy and popular walkway which starts opposite Asda and continues to Tweedbank and beyond. Most of the path is not overlooked by houses which makes it potentially vulnerable and there have been a number of incidents over the years.Community Councillor Bill White said: “The walk we did was well worthwhile. It pointed out a few points and identied a few areas of concern to look at and hopefully we can take this forward.“I’ve already said that I think we should change the name of it from the Black Path. There needs to be some landscaping done and there are some areas where a little more lighting could help. CCTV would certainly put people off and maybe make people feel a bit safer. But there is certainly a lot of work to be done I think more down toward the Gasworks but it’s a nice walk.Sergeant Granger offered advice to people using the path. He said: : “Fortunately such incidents fairly rare in the Borders, but we can’t become complacent. My advice would be to be aware of your own surroundings, keep your phone about you and let your family knowyou’re walking along here late at night. If you are walking on the path and you are concerned about anyone you see, oryou think you’re being followed, then just contact the police straight away on .\".removeCommunity council chairperson Judith Cleghorn said: “It could be such a beautul walk.

It was the Pupils who would concede it.In another move tinged with disappointment # the match referee failing to spot another offside in the build-up # a ball from the right flank was swung in to a player in an offside position, who held the ball up and worked it back to a central area where Finnart’s captain unleashed a strong strike high into the Pupils’ net.And while the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils continued to work hard to claw their way back into the match they were undone with only a few minutes remaining by a smart counter-attack at the other end, which allowed Finnart’s number  to score from close range with a low, side-footed effort.On reflection, the Pupils were undone by moments of business-like quality – certainly for goals two and four from their hosts # and perhaps their own naivety against a canny and disciplined side who are challenging to win the WoSFL’s Division Four.Nevertheless, the Pupils can reflect on a decent, determined performance for much of this match.

He was protected well by right back Conner Brown, left back Burns and central defensive pairing Ross Souden and captain Keith Mitchell.With less than  minutes remaining, McCallum – who had shted into central midfield with the introduction of second sub and debutant Cameron Wylie at right midfield – intercepted a ball from a Glenvale player, his tackle putting Lang one on one with the hosts# keeper.Lang showed excellent composure for his tender years to slot the ball low into the net with his right foot, just inside the box, his teammates joining him in celebration.After seeing out the final five minutes of regulation time, four nervy minutes of added time were played as Glenvale pushed for an equaliser.In the st minute, Ferguson was called upon to make the save of the day, stopping a powerful Glenvale drive from  yards out, before a Pupils defender cleared the danger.The final whistle sounded soon after and the Pupils# squad and management could cheer a hard-earned, much-needed win, especially impressive considering the inexperience of much of the squad, who are still learning at this level, but judging by this showing, are certainly contributing.Tomorrow , the Pupils host high-flying Harmony Row from Govan, at Kintyre Park.Kick-off pm.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season. The quantity required will y with soil type, but  to  litres per square metre – four to six watering cans – each week in dry weather will do the trick.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow lettuce seeds – both under cover and outside.If you start now, it will give you a continuous supply that can be harvested throughout the year.Sow in modules or fibre pots under cover to have lettuces ready to plant outside in four to six weeks. You can also sow outdoors, but use cloches or small poly tunnels until next month when the soil has warmed up. They will also provide your lettuce seedlings with protection from birds and slugs.Good ieties to start now include cut-and-come again Salad Bowl – oak leaved, high yield with green and red ieties a cos such as Lobjoits Green – dense, crisp heads with self folding leaves or the small butterhead Tom Thumb – perfect for growing in small spaces, it matures early and has a mild taste.Prepare for spring by carrying out basic maintenance.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, this month there are signs of the approaching spring, with bulbs appearing and wildle waking up as light levels and temperatures increase.There#s plenty to do indoors this month to prepare for the season ahead.Outdoors, as the garden comes to le, it#s time to prune shrubs and climbers, such as wisteria, as well as evergreen hedges.CAPTION:If one of your gardening new year resolutions was to plant a tree, now is the time to make that a reality.

held two online sessions recently to highlight the project, amid concern by Musselburgh and District Angling Clubabout the issue of mine water discharge, fearing it was having “a negative effect on the fish and invertebrate communities in the South Esk”.These concerns predate the recent pollution incident in the River Esk last month.Residents who attended the Coal Authority sessions heard more details about the plans for the treatment scheme at Dalkeith, which will remove iron and manganese from water flowing from a historical drainage tunnel adjacent to Newmills Road, known locally as Junkies Adit.The tunnel is linked tothe extensive underground coal mine workings in the Midlothian area.In recent years, the amount of mine water discharging from Junkies Adit has been increasing and the water quality has been deteriorating, the Coal Authority said.The organisation explained that the water affected was visibly orange, which was a result of naturally occurring iron dissolving in the mine water underground, which then became solid as it mixed with air and settled out of the water.In recent years, the discolouration has become more visible further downstream and could affect the river’s ecologyleft untreated, the Coal Authority added.The Coal Authority has been working with the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyand other partners to monitor the problem and develop a solution.Details for planning approval will be submitted shortly, with a view to starting the main construction later this year.More detailed design work will be done in the coming months to develop the scheme, and residents and stakeholders will have the chance to provide feedback as the designs progress.John Batty, Coal Authority project manager, said: “I think a lot of residents are keen to see this project progress as the river is so visibly orange as a result of the mine water, and the negative impact on the wildle and ecology is widely known.“The mine workings are complex so it has taken many years to get to this point.“We have been working to carry out studies and investigations, evaluate potential solutions and establish water quality by taking water samples on a regular basis through the challenges of the pandemic.“We have undertaken research using a test treatment scheme on site last spring that provided a large amount of information to feed into the designs.”Paul Butler, SEPA mining sector lead, said: “We are pleased that the progress we have made together has enabled the Coal Authority to provide information on the proposals for a new mine water treatment scheme at the site of Junkies Adit.”Colin Beattie, MSP for Midlothian North and Musselburgh, said: “I think it is important that the public are involved with the process and it is vital public engagement continues as the scheme progresses.“I look forward to seeing the next stages of the treatment scheme and working with the Coal Authority, SEPA and the local community on this project.”Steven Dalgleish, of MDAA, said: “No faulting the Coal Authority’s commitment to the cause but the association remains gravely concerned that funding may not appear for this project.“From some of our own

ticket.”The Burgh Prosecutor, Mr Alistair Leslie, said that when Mr Robert Rae, the starter, asked the accused for the fee of  n.p. he replied: “You are getting no money from me.”Provost William

the county, as reported by The Haddingtonshire Courier on February , .The gale of Friday will not readily be forgotten by fishermen and others along this coast, for an angrier sea has not been witnessed for many years.In some respects the storm presented unusual aspects.For instance, the sea broke fully two miles northward, and at times the roar of the backwash could be heard far inland.The outlook seawards was awe-inspiring, as for some hours the breakers were from twelve to twenty feet high, and enormous volumes of water were rocketed over the harbour wall to a height of nearly one hundred feet.Driving clouds of sleet and rain were the prevailing conditions from early morning till midnight, and the outlook was as bleak and wild as could possibly be conceived."},{"url":null,"title":"floral-display-created-within-boat-seafront","story":"The new flower bed will be planted up in late May early June – featuring geraniums, begonias and dahlias – by

I’ve been to Bamburgh beach several times before and it always works. It always make you stop and look – at the castle, which is the finest on this coastline of castles, and at the long stretch of sand, spread flat and gold, butter on toast, and back along the coast towards the village of Seahouses where we’re staying, at the Bamburgh Castle Inn. Scots may be brought up to think their coastline is the most beautul in the British Isles, but I’m not so sure. I’ve defected.The Castle Inn is also the perfect place to see and enjoy this part of the coast. The hotel sits at the top of the harbour and the dog-friendly room we’re staying in has its own little private garden that starts with a comfy terrace and ends with a view of the fishing boats and the pier and the North Sea. Winter’s on the way so the sea is in a bit of a bad mood when we arrive, but it doesn’t matter. We retreat to the hotel’s restaurant and order pints of Doom Bar and plates piled high with chips.The next day is more castles and our choice this time is Dunstanburgh, a ridiculously dramatic ruin a few miles south of Bamburgh. One of the best ways to get there is to park at the village of Craster and walk along the coast and there it is: charcoaled across the horizon, dark, ruinous. It was built in  not as a fortress against the Scots, as you might expect in this part of England in the th century, but as a fortress against the wrong kind of English . We circle the battlements. The sheep pay us no mind.Then, having let the distant past crowd in, we travel inland to a dferent, more personal kind of history. Our destination is the village of Allendale. We park near the King’s Head pub and head down the hill and there it is, parked incongruously, mockingly even, at the bottom of a flight of steps. It’s a Dalek and it’s the doorman of the Museum of Classic Sci-Fi.Inside, we meet Neil Cole, the creator and curator of the museum. It’s an extraordinary and exciting place for someone like me – whose hero was, is, and always will be Tom Baker – but for Neil it’s even more personal.He remembers playing in the fields and moors of Northumberland when he was growing up in the s and his childish mind could turn rocky outcrops into landing sites for Sontaran spacecraft and the moorland into the Death Zone on Gallrey. This is where his imagination, sparked by a TV programme, came to play.And now, aged , his vivid imagination has turned the basement of his home in Allendale into a fascinating museum full of the original props and paintings and monsters that he’s collected over the years. There is the head of a killer mummy and the face of an alien gastropod and a complete example of a Zygon, the race of aliens who hid in an underground base in Scotland and controlled the Loch Ness Monster. Neil says the magic is in getting close to the things that matter to you and I see what he means. It’s a wonderful place that delights in the possibilities of imagination and the craftsmanship of the people who turn imagination into objects.There’s something similar going on in the shop we visit on the way back to the coast: Re, in Corbridge. This town was once the place where the Romans controlled the north of Englandbut it’s now an attractive market town full of quirky shops and Re is the best of them. It sells a mixture of new and antique home accessories and we wander through little corridors of plates and cups and jugs, and past shelves of primary-colour cushions and end up in a corner piled high with yellow and red and blue slabs of soap. My urge is to buy it all.And the shopping is not done for the day. We head for Alnwick and the beloved Barters book shop, said to be the biggest second-hand book store in Britain. Who knowsit is or not but I do know how wonderful it is. It’s housed in a former railway station and there’s a model train that runs round the room to remind you of its origins. I spend two hours browsing, stop for a baked potato in the café, then do another two hours. In the land of castles, this is a castle of books.Bags full of goodies, we head back to the Bamburgh Castle Inn. Some pub restaurants rise above the phrase “pub grub” and this is one of them. The homemade steak and stout pie is a rich, handsome thing but so is the Tex-Mex veggie burger andseafood’s your thing, some Scottish mussels have also made their way down here. It is all topped off, naturally, with a few more sips of Doom Bar. We take our pints out to the terrace. Down at the harbour, some fishermen are working on their boat. A man is walking his dog up from the beach. The gulls glide. But we are still. We’ve stopping moving again. And we’re happy.TRAVEL FACTSMark Smith was a guest stayed at The Bamburgh Castle Inn as a guest of The Inn Collection Group www.inncollectiongroup.

They were close to each other and they were in a good mood.“I expected more entertainment but it was good to see the harmony between them.”Ben Sulayem chaired the four-hour meeting and is expected to address the continued fallout from Abu Dhabi later this week, with a restructure of race control expected.One school of thought is that Masi, a surprise attendee at Monday’s meeting, could be forced to take up a lesser role, with Portuguese Eduardo Freitas moving across from the World Endurance Championship to replace him.But the under-fire Masi has found the support of a number of drivers in recent days, with four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel, British driver Lando Norris and his McLaren team-mate Daniel Ricciardo all speaking up on his behalf.Ben Sulayem added: “We agreed on certain things and the analysis is still going on.F Commission Meeting – Media Statementhttps:t.co JYcNYRvZ— FIAFebruary , “Information will soon be announced, but the integrity of the FIA will always be intact.

Butshe finishes in the top three, no medals will be awarded, with the podium put on hold until the full investigations into the Russian’s doping case has concluded. vw,vw,px, px\"Kamila Valieva delivered her lowest score of the season in Beijing Valieva’s fellow competitors criticised the decision. Askedshe had sympathy for Valieva, Great Britain’s Natasha McKay said: “I have sympathy for whoever will be on the podium who won’t be receiving their medals – it’s the most important part of the Olympics and they won’t get that chance.“I wish it was a level playing field and it’s not, but they’ve made a decision they’ve made and I can’t do anything about that.”American Mariah Bell, whose team-mates are still awaiting their medals after finishing in the silver medal position behind Russia in last week’s team event, added: “I feel sad for my team-mates. It seems wrong to punish people who have done things the right way.” vw,vw,px, px\"Kamila Valieva fell whilst attempting a triple axel In Moscow, meanwhile, giant posters appeared on the side of tower blocks with a picture of the skater bearing the message: “Kamila – we are with you.”Valieva had been cleared to compete despite ing a positive sample for the banned heart medication at the Russian National Championships on Christmas Day.Earlier, the International Olympic Committee’s head of discipline, Denis Oswald, revealed that the Russian case to the CAS had centred on the claim that the trace of trimetazidine in Valieva’s system could have come from sharing the same drinking glass as her grandfather, who takes the drug for medical reasons.“Her argument was this contamination happened with a product her grandfather was taking,” Oswald told reporters in Beijing.Valieva received the loudest cheer of the night when she was introduced prior to the start of her programme. She almost touched down on her opening triple axel, but otherwise landed all her elements and appeared to be in tears at the end of her routine.Despite falling well short of her . score in last week’s team competition, which came close to her own world record of ., it was clearly going to be enough to establish a lead, and underscored the gulf in class between the -year-old and even her most capable of rivals.Shcherbakova, the -year-old reigning world champion, required a relatively clean run to even come close, while Japan’s Kaori Sakamoto also delivered a season’s best . to sit in the bronze medal position.Both Valieva and Shcherbakova, along with fourth-placed Alexandra Trusova, hail from the same club in Moscow, Sambo-, and share the same coach, Eteri Tutberidze, who has come under fire for the number of injuries and premature retirements endured by skaters under her tutelage.The notion of diminished responsibility due to her age, and the implicit sht in focus towards her entourage, formed one of the “exceptional circumstances” behind the CAS decision to allow Valieva to compete, along with the delay in the delivery of the results from the WADA-accredited laboratory in Stockholm.“The prevention of harassment and abuse in sport is hugely important and minors are maybe particularly vulnerable, but everyone is vulnerable,” the IOC’s medical and scientic director, Richard Budgett, said on Tuesday.“We have a responsibility to make sure the programmes are in place to protect all those iniduals, and certainly you can look at doping in many cases as a form of abuse, so the prevention and safeguarding programmes are particularly important.”The CAS committee delivered its verdict after the International Testing Agency , along with WADA and the International Skating Union , appealed the Russian Anti-Doping Agency’s decision to lt Valieva’s suspension.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1644849796034.jpg--covid_19___mon_14th_february_figures.jpg?1644849796000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220214newscovid 19 mon 14th february figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows two further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueBaroness May Blood, Campaign Chair of the Integrated Education Fund.Mark BainTwitterEmailFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe campaign chair of the Integrated Education Fund, Baroness May Blood, has challenged churches to show how they are actively encouraging children from Protestant and Catholic backgrounds to enrol in their schools.It comes as the DUP have launched a petition of concern in a bid to block an Integrated Education Bill at Stormont, with both the Controlled Schools Support Counciland the Council for Catholic Maintained Schoolsvoicing opposition to the bill.Read MoreDUP confirms its opposition to Integrated Education BillViewpoint:OpinionProgress is possible in education systemDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson confirmed his party would be seeking support to invoke the petition.“It has been  years since I first volunteered my time and support to the cause of integrated education. I have never seen such momentum, or debate, around the issue as there is today,” Baroness Blood told the Belfast .“Support for educating children together has never been higher, with polls consistently telling us that over % of Northern Irish parents believe that integrated education should be the norm. Four new schools joined the integrated family in , with another confirmed to transform in . Marking  years of integration with Lagan College not only allowed us to celebrate how far we’ve come, but to focus on the future.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “I would be interested to learnthe CCMS and CSSC are pro-actively encouraging more children from the Protestant and Catholic tradition to enrol in their schools in numbers that reflect the demographic.I’d like to knowthey support the ending of the exemption from fair employment legislation for Northern Irish teaching staff. I’d like to know what steps they’re taking to ensure that the membership of their boards of governors is representative, inclusive and erse.“There are  integrated schools in Northern Ireland. Each and every one of those schools has either been set up from scratch by committed parents or transformed through a successful parental ballot and a long review process. Each one of those parents has shown massive courage and belief in the ideal of educating children together, not only for the benefit of their own children, but for generations to come.“This parent power has been exercised in the face of indference, and in some cases hostility, from many of those in power at Stormont. The advance of the Private Members Bill on Integrated Education through the Assembly and the recently-launched Independent Review of Education has focused minds at Stormont, while high-profile support in the Press following the launch of Kenneth Branagh’s Belfast has brought the issue to the fore in the public domain.”Baroness Blood said it’s the the growing status of integrated education that had led to greater resistance from other sectors.She added: “With success comes scrutiny. Recently the leaders of the CCMS and the CSSC have gone out of their way to argue that all schools within their sectors need to be recognised as inclusive, erse and in some cases integrated in all but name. We welcome the news that any school wants to reflect society and encourage integration, but the figures do not add up.“The inescapable reality is less than % of pupils enrolled in Catholic schools here come from a Protestant tradition and less than % of children in controlled schools are Catholic. It is also an education system where we have two separate planning authorities for schools, one just for Catholic schools and one for the rest. Notably, it is a system of education that leaves many of our young people wanting to leave Northern Ireland, never to .“Wanting to advance integrated education is not about detracting from any sector or belittling the achievements of any schools and teachers who work incredibly hard to provide the best education for our children. It is not about removing choice, rather working towards providing a place in an integrated school for any child who wants it.”If successful, the petition of concern would mean any voting on the bill would need to see a majority of support from both unionists and nationalists to see it passed.Earlier this week, the CCMS and the CCMS wrote to parents encouraging them to raise concerns over the bill with their local MLAs.The Integrated Education Bill, brought to Stormont by Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong, is expected toto Stormont next week for further scrutiny.Related topicsDepartment of EducationSir Jeffrey DonaldsonMost ReadStephen Nolan explores ‘heart-breaking’ family history in new BBC documentaryAll Covid- restrictions to be lted in Northern Ireland from TuesdaySam McBrideOpinionWhen you get into the weeds, there’s a lot more to these polls than Sinn Fein becoming Northern Ireland’s biggest partySuzanne BreenOpinionWhat a fool Ian Paisley has been… century after Carson and in midst of their Brexit betrayal, the penny finally drops over Tory infidelityFormer boxing champion Eamonn Magee charged with assaulting and imprisoning a woman in BelfastTop VideosPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storePlayVideo: Shots fired over coffin of IRA veteran Victor NotarantonioPlayVideo: Belfast murals - The city#s past and future collideLatest EducationMLAs back Bill to defer school starting age for some children from four to fiveDUP confirms its opposition to Integrated Education BillViewpointOpinionProgress is possible in education systemNI university staff begin -day strike action over pay and ‘brutal’ pension cutsHalf-term holidays in Northern Ireland: A guide to the best family fun daysLatestFox with watering can on head prompts rescue operationCovid vaccine developer Gilbert hopes for ‘caution’ when restrictions ltMary Robinson says climate crisis a ‘minority issue’ as Seanad marks centenaryVirgin Media O G coverage reaches nearly two-thirds of London populationCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Four deaths and , new cases,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Picture: Peter Morrison PA WirePA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueHealth Minister Robin Swann. Picture: Peter Morrison PA WireLisa SmythTwitterFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailAll Covid- legal restrictions in Northern Ireland will be replaced by guidance from Tuesday, Health Minister Robin Swann has announced.Among the Covid- restrictions being removed from law are the requirement to wear a face covering in public places and the use Covid certicates in nightclubs – although their use in all hospitality and entertainment will continue to be encouraged.Mr Swann also reiterated his position that there are currently no plans for changes to the current arrangements for testing, contact tracing and isolation in Northern Ireland.The decision to scrap Covid- laws follows consideration of legal advice from the Attorney General and consultation with Executive ministers and moves the pandemic response in Northern Ireland into a new phase.However, announcing the swathe of relaxations, the UUP minister also stressed the continuing need for caution and vigilance as a further , cases and two deaths linked to the virus were recorded.Mr Swann, who revealed at the weekend that he had tested positive for Covid, said: “With the reduced threat from the Omicron iant, we can move away from an emergency and legalistic framework to a new approach where making safer choices is embedded in our daily lives.“That means all of us continuing to do our best to cut down risks of infection and transmission.“It means looking after each other by following the public health guidance. It must always be remembered that taking unnecessary risks with Covid may affect people who are particularly vulnerable to the virus.“So please do not jump the gun and start behaving asthe pandemic is over. That is not the case.“While omicron is less severe than previous strains of the virus, community transmission remains very high and hospital pressures signicant.“The most vulnerable as a result of underlying disease remain susceptible to severe illness and it is important that we all do what we can to protect them.”Mr Swann warned that coronavirus “is likely to stay with us in some form for some time” but he said emergency restrictions cannot remain in place indefinitely.He continued: “A large part of what we currently do to protect ourselves is already covered by guidance rather than regulations.“This includes self-isolating when infected and taking lateral flow tests before meeting up with others.“The guidance will continue to emphasise all the steps that we should keep taking to protect each other.“I will, of course, keep the situation on regulations under ongoing and detailed review. We cannot rule out a new iant emerging down the line with new interventions being required. I very much hope that will not be the case.”Mr Swann has made the announcement having received the latest public health assessment from the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientic Adviser.“The expectation from the public health assessments is that no signicant rise in ICU occupancy is expected,” he continued.“While many people will very much welcome my decision on regulations, I know there will be concerns. Community transmission is still very high and our hospitals remain under severe pressure.“A sustained effort to follow the public health guidance will help reduce infection numbers and support our health service.”As the hospitality sector will continue to be encouraged to use Covid certicates, Mr Swann said the importance of wearing face coverings in health and social care settings, on public transport and in enclosed indoor settings “will continue to be strongly emphasised”.Vaccine certication will continue to be available to the public – including for those who need it for travel abroad to satisfy entry requirements of countries they are visiting.Related topicsRobin SwannMore On Robin SwannBusinesses annoyed work from home guidance remains PremiumNiamh CampbellOpinionImportant day forto some kind of normalityNorthern Ireland’s Covid rules to scrapped and replaced with guidance PremiumLisa SmythOpinionRobin Swann left in unenviable position over Covid- restrictionsHealth Minister Robin Swann tests positive for Covid-Most ReadStephen Nolan explores ‘heart-breaking’ family history in new BBC documentaryAll Covid- restrictions to be lted in Northern Ireland from TuesdaySam McBrideOpinionWhen you get into the weeds, there’s a lot more to these polls than Sinn Fein becoming Northern Ireland’s biggest partySuzanne BreenOpinionWhat a fool Ian Paisley has been… century after Carson and in midst of their Brexit betrayal, the penny finally drops over Tory infidelityMatt LeBlanc and Northern Ireland girlfriend Aurora Milligan split upTop VideosPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storePlayVideo: Shots fired over coffin of IRA veteran Victor NotarantonioPlayVideo: Belfast murals - The city#s past and future collideLatest CoronavirusCrown Court trials that were halted by pandemic set to resume this weekBusinesses annoyed work from home guidance remainsMark BainOpinionThe end is nigh, and thankfully the world is looking brighter than two years agoNiamh CampbellOpinionImportant day forto some kind of normalityNorthern Ireland’s Covid rules to scrapped and replaced with guidanceLatestInter boss Simone Inzaghi happy with recent performances despite dropped pointsPeaky Blinders has been ‘amazing journey’, says creator ahead of final seasonJimmy Carr’s management reassures venue over jokes controversy, council saysFootballer Sala felt pressured into making record transfer, mother tells inquestVicar’s child abuse ‘could have been stoppedclergy had listened to victims’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurney PA WireFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailWhen the books are written and history students look back on the early s, they’ll be forgiven for thinking they’re studying science fiction instead.Had a man with a sandwich board been shouting “the end is nigh” outside Belfast City Hall in February , it would have looked like he had a point. It was the end of the world as we knew it.Read MoreNiamh Campbell:OpinionImportant day forto some kind of normalityNorthern Ireland’s Covid rules scrapped and replaced with guidance“The end is nigh” means something dferent today, and we can all breathe a little easier.There is no doubt that without the restrictions we would be looking back on a lot more lives lost to Covid than the official figure of over ,.For many, their last moments were spent alone. For those who mourned, they watched from afar. That was one of the hardest restrictions to bear.Pulling our bedroom curtains closed on Monday, March , , we did so wondering what sort of world would await when we opened them the next morning.The UK death toll stood at , three of them here.St Patrick’s Day had already been cancelled, giving the first hint of what was heading our direction. Then lockdown started.Farewells were said to those in nursing homes as the doors closed to visits. Businesses shut, save for those deemed essential.The queues outside supermarkets started. Our children spent their first day at home after the closure of schools.That was  days ago.We had all suspected it was coming, having watched images from around the world as the pandemic wave approached our shores.Shielding letters were sent to , of the most vulnerable, telling how they were to go into isolation.March ,  was furlough day as the Government committed to support % of wages for employees.Three days later gatherings of more than two people were banned. It was essential trips only.Thursday, March  saw the start of a weekly ritual as we clapped for carers. Communities made scrubs and masks for front line workers. On a bigger scale, companies were redeploying staff and taking on new workers to help the cause as fears over a lack of PPE rose.Then, at pm on Saturday, March  lockdown officially commenced.We said farewell to work colleagues, socially distanced ourselves from family and friends, and started to embrace a new style of community.Those of us with children became teachers overnight. Our children taught us a thing or two also, with crash courses on Zoom, Facetime and TikTok.The older generation had to embrace the technology the young had grown up with. Hands upyou logged in to a Zoom meeting hiding those pyjama bottoms under the kitchen table Maybe it was just as well for our egos the pubs and nightclubs were closed. Self-styled hair, out of necessity, was perhaps not the way to go.Strange as it may seem, being apart from other people actually brought us closer together.For the older among us, we instantly felt a need to hug our parents as soon as we were told we couldn’t. It would be a shame not to remember that. In a way, we all became heroes of a sort. “Stay at home, save lives,” was the message. We stayed at home, while others manned the front line.Driving around was an eerie experience in those early days — few cars on the road shops shut.And when we went out for a walk to get some exercise we actually heard the birdsong.Weddings were halted. Birthdays went uncelebrated. Holidays put on hold.And in the midst of all the sitting around doing not very much at all, a new vocabulary sprung up: furlough the R-rate PPE self-isolation shielding.Social distancing was no longer the domain of the school disco, where the boys sat on one side and the girls on the other.We all wanted to knowwe were a key worker. There was the unprecedented rolling out of guidelines, restrictions, support services and grants to keep businesses afloat.Confusion reigned: how many could meet in a garden  Where could airplanes take us to, and what did we need to get there  What was a ‘wet’ pub Little by little, the restrictions we were living with eased and chinks of light started to emerge.Cemeteries reopened on April  after a public outcry — the first easing of curbs.Monday, May  saw garden centres reopen, with the promise of more rules being ltedthe downward trend in cases of Covid continued.All eyes were on the R-rate, but the same day saw the first signs of a lockdown breakdown.By the end of the month, with temperatures soaring, thousands headed for the seaside.Still, on May , for the first time since March , no deaths were recorded. Positive signs were emerging, and further lockdown easements saw le edging back, evenit was baby steps.But there were relapses. We were teased with the freedom of the pre-pandemic world, only to have it pulled back from us as new iants, second waves of the virus, kept arriving.Restrictions came, then were eased. But they never went away.For many, particularly in the business world, there has been a heavy price to pay.Some pub doors were shut, never to open again. Even big names such as Debenhams could not survive the pandemic, having battled for years against the growth in online retailing.Then there was the impact on people’s wellbeing.That many died having contracted Covid has been well documented, but lockdown brought with it the extra baggage of isolation. The mental state of people was a constant concern.Sure, it’ll be over by Christmas, we said in . We said the same in .It wouldn’t be this placethe ending of restrictions didn’t bring with it some added confusion and doubt.With the Executive unable to meet due to the lack of a First and Deputy First Minister, the issue became a legal matter.In years to come there’ll be plenty of stories told starting with the words: “Do you remember the time ”Those history books  years from now will be filled with the facts and the figures, the bumps in the road, the scandals of those in public office.But we’ve lived with it all, lived through it all, and come out the other side.We can all see a little more clearly now.The dark clouds have been replaced by that hopeful rainbow we’ve been teased with several times over the past two years.There does come a time when we have to learn to live in the world as it is, as close as we can to the way we did.We might not be quite stepping into the brightest of bright days.Restrictions will change to guidelines and recommendations.There will still be many content to take the precautions they feel they need, and everyone should move forward at their own pace.Hopefully the last two years have taught the majority of us to appreciate the things in our lives that are most important to us — our family and friends.Le moves fast. Hopefully, before long, the darkest days of Covid will be a memory.Being honest, a lot of people had left those memories behind some time ago.But think, too, of those who bring the memory of loved ones lost into a world their parent, husband, we, sister or brother is not there to enjoy beside them.Related topicsBelfast City CouncilMore On Belfast City CouncilCost sinks council plan to make Belfast public transport free for young people PremiumBBC NI presenters topping up pay packets with money-spinning external engagementsBelfast City council set to launch legal action over Poots’ port checks move PremiumHolyland residents instruct Belfast law firm to take legal action against PSNI, council and Stormont department PremiumGail WalkerOpinionThe idea NI’s dficulty is nationalism’s opportunity is corrosive...

It must always be remembered that taking unnecessary risks with Covid may affect people who are particularly vulnerable to the virus.“So please do not jump the gun and start behaving asthe pandemic is over. That is not the case.“While Omicron is less severe than previous strains of the virus, community transmission remains very high and hospital pressures signicant.“The most vulnerable as a result of underlying disease remain susceptible to severe illness and it is important that we all do what we can to protect them.”Mr Swann warned that coronavirus “is likely to stay with us in some form for some time” but he said emergency restrictions cannot remain in place indefinitely.He continued: “A large part of what we currently do to protect ourselves is already covered by guidance rather than regulations.“This includes self-isolating when infected and taking lateral flow tests before meeting up with others. The guidance will continue to emphasise all the steps that we should keep taking to protect each other.“I will, of course, keep the situation on regulations under ongoing and detailed review. We cannot rule out a new iant emerging down the line with new interventions being required. I very much hope that will not be the case.”Mr Swann has made the announcement having received the latest public health assessment from the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientic Adviser.“The expectation from the public health assessments is that no signicant rise in ICU occupancy is expected,” he continued.“While many people will very much welcome my decision on regulations, I know there will be concerns. Community transmission is still very high and our hospitals remain under severe pressure.“A sustained effort to follow the public health guidance will help reduce infection numbers and support our health service.”As the hospitality sector will continue to be encouraged to use Covid certicates, Mr Swann said the importance of wearing face coverings in health and social care settings, on public transport and in enclosed indoor settings “will continue to be strongly emphasised”.The Covid- regulations in Northern Ireland are not due to expire until March , but had been reviewed by the Executive every three weeks.The resignation of First Minister Paul Givan complicated the process of lting the remaining rules.Mr Swann was advised on the potential legal complications of him replacing regulations with guidance, without the wider endorsement of an Executive.On Monday Sinn Fein deputy leader Michelle O’Neill said Stormont ministers had given their unanimous support to Mr Swann to ease restrictions.Related topicsThe Executive OfficeRobin SwannMichelle O#NeillPaul GivanMore On The Executive Office PremiumCrown Court trials that were halted by pandemic set to resume this weekParties’ apology for abuse victims ‘will be welcomed’ PremiumNiamh CampbellOpinionImportant day forto some kind of normalityPoll’s negative comments on bonfires and flags in north Down criticisedCost sinks council plan to make Belfast public transport free for young peopleMost ReadStephen Nolan explores ‘heart-breaking’ family history in new BBC documentaryAll Covid- restrictions to be lted in Northern Ireland from TuesdaySam McBrideOpinionWhen you get into the weeds, there’s a lot more to these polls than Sinn Fein becoming Northern Ireland’s biggest partySuzanne BreenOpinionWhat a fool Ian Paisley has been… century after Carson and in midst of their Brexit betrayal, the penny finally drops over Tory infidelityFormer boxing champion Eamonn Magee charged with assaulting and imprisoning a woman in BelfastTop VideosPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storePlayVideo: Shots fired over coffin of IRA veteran Victor NotarantonioPlayVideo: Belfast murals - The city#s past and future collideLatest Northern IrelandMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageHope forto normality on day Covid restrictions lt in N IrelandWhat are the coronavirus rules in the four UK nations Drivers warned of dangers of very high winds as two named storms approach UKStormont cannot strike three-year budget amid current crisis, minister saysLatestIrish FA chief ‘expects’ Stormont to honour £.m stadia funding for football clubs in line with Casement Park commitmentCouncils told by Home Office to find accommodation for migrant childrenKremlin critic Alexei Navalny stands new trial at penal colonyMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageInter boss Simone Inzaghi happy with recent performances despite dropped points,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have to follow the example of St Patrick and bring the light to recallsothers.ldquoWe have to start again, bringing the light of Christ into our hearts, our families and into our homes. We all know these are days of darkness, we have been living through them, days of fear and anxiety. We need the joy of the gospel, the joy of Christ, joy brought to Ireland by St Patrick.Fr Alexander continued: ldquoEach of us has to ask ourselves, what am I going to do to bring the light of faith to others  Generations of our ancestors kept the faith alive. What are you going to do to keep the faith alive  Let us revive our faith and go forward with St Patrick.Archbishop Jude Thaddeus told the congregation that St Patrick was not sent by to Ireland ldquoby God by chance.ldquoHis mission in Ireland was a deliberate intention of God, he continued. ldquoWe can read this in St Patrickrsquos writings and from the example he left behind. When St Patrick wanted to come back to Ireland, there was a lot of opposition. In his time, there were many missionaries, including bishops and priests. We have hardly heard of many of these, but we all know about St Patrick. This is very striking. Why is it so ldquoSt Patrick did not speak much, he didnrsquot write much. Today there are too many words ndash words, words, words ndash written words, spoken words, words on the internet, words on the microphone, words on the streets and the market places. There are too many words, just one word is important ndash the Word of God. If we could just listen to even a single Word of God.Referring to the Gospel readings for the feast of Candlemas, the Papal Nuncio added: ldquoOur Lady did not say anything at the Presentation of Our Lord, she kept everything in her heart. In the entire Gospel. St Joseph speaks only two words. Sometimes we speak too many words and we lose orientation and get confused. Only one word is important ndash the Word of God ndash we should listen to the Word of God. St Patrick listened to the Word of God.Speaking afterwards of his visit, Archbishop Okolo said: ldquoIt was indeed nice and uplting, praying together on that holy ground, on which St Patrick trod.Next week, the All Ireland Novena journeys to Slane where St Patrick lit the Paschal fire.The Novena can be watched online at pm via the parish webcam..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9Feburary2020_Panto.jpg","title":"Children on stage for The Wizard of Oz show  ","story":"THE abundance of musical and dramatic talent at the Patrician Youth Centre in Downpatrick is back on show for the first time in almost two years.A young and enthusiastic cast presented the pantomime, The Wizard of Oz, last week.Performing Arts and live productions at the Patrician paused in March  with the onset of Covid- and ensuing pandemic.Determined to get going again, staff and members worked on Tom Whalleyrsquos new pantomime production of the very popular musical The Wizard of Oz.Despite many ongoing Covid disruptions were delighted to have a performance which was live streamed last week.Unfortunately, in the lead-up to the event some of the principal cast members were Covid isolating.On the day before the performance leading lady Shona Gardiner, who was to play Dorothy, tested positive.In true showbiz tradition, the show had to go on and a telephone call from a former Patrician member saved the day.Mairead OrsquoHare, who played Dorothy in the Patricianrsquos  production of the Wizard of Oz, volunteered to stand in to read the role and sing the ever-popular songs. Mairead ed and performed like she never had been away.Senior youth worker Yvonne Maguire congratulated everyone connected with the production mdash the cast members, production team, friends of Patrician, parents, and families for supporting members, children and young people.She extended a sincere thank you to Mairead for standing in at the last minute and also paid tribute to Shona, who had worked so hard in preparing for the performance and regrettably did not get the opportunity to star.A recording of Shona singing will be available on Facebook.The principal cast members were: Mairead OrsquoHare , Aaron Mullan , Aedan OrsquoHare , Annie May OrsquoHare , Eamon OrsquoHare , Eva Bailie , Tyler Fung , Zoe Gaines .Chorus, dancers, monkeys, trees and crows: Caitie Cunlfe, Caragh Moore, Conal McDowell, Ella Grace Cunlfe, Emily Douglas, Georgia Savage, Jack McDonald, Katie Fegan, Kayleigh Rogers, Lilly Boyd, Maria Rooney, Megan Megahey, Molly Boyd, Molly Madine, Oisin OrsquoHare, Poppy Baggley, Poppy Woodall.Patrician Youth Centre would also like to thank the following staff team and friends for making the production possible: Caitriona Smyth, Anthony Frew, Bridin Wells, Eamonn Hanlon, Charlie Hanlon, David McBennett, Melissa Poland, Paddy Watters, Mark Hassett, Anna Murray and Teresa Sweeney.Thanks are also extended other team members and the centre trainee leader membership who supported the event..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_Sea.jpg","title":"Drive for better sea swimming facilities  ","story":"A SERIES of measures to improve the safety of sea swimmers in Newcastle have been suggested to Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The local authority has been asked to address the needs of the increasing numbers who enjoy swimming at the resortrsquos harbour.Council officials met recently with Mournes councillor Laura Devlin who is working to secure improved access to the water and the needs of those who enjoy cold water swimming.Cllr Devlin said while sea swimming has always been popular in the resort, there is an increasing number of people taking to the water as a result of Covid which prompted many people across the district to be more active.She said Newcastlersquos Harbour Heritage Association is bringing many people who use services at the harbour together to provide them with a ldquounied voice with the group including representatives of the sea swimming community.ldquoCold water therapy is now an established activity and the coronavirus pandemic will unfortunately have a lasting impact on mental health, continued Cllr Devlin.ldquoThis type of therapy is seen as a successful line of defence and even treatment for many, notwithstanding the superb physical benefits and enjoyment that cold water swimming brings.Cllr Devlin says there are many activities at Newcastle harbour which can sometimes lead to a congested slipway, explaining that there are ldquosignicant safety concerns when swimmers, boats and jet-skis are in the water at once.The local councillor, who met recently with council officials and was joined by local sea swimmer Fiona Davey, has also highlighted parking problems at the harbour which she said are ldquocontinuing to deteriorate.She continued: ldquoI have also consulted with The Harbour Heritage Association and we agreed a list of issues that need to be addressed which the local authority which is considering improvements to the water access point on the harbour side of the Rock Pool or at the Back Shore.ldquoAn extension of the ramp leading to the water is also required to allow for disability access, while a handrail to assist people entering and exiting the water as well as hooks for clothes and storage, and a seating area for changing is also required.Council officials have also been asked to provide buoys near the pier to section off the area for those jumping into the water and sea swimming in general.Cllr Devlin also highlighted the need for height markers on the pier wall in order that those who jump into the water will know the depth, explaining the water depth can be an issue during the summer months.Council officials have also been asked to provide distance markers, so swimmers know how far out they are.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoThis is a flavour of our asks and really is just a starting point. I donrsquot see any of the issues that have been highlighted as costing a signicant amount. If they can be implemented, they would make a tangible dference to harbour users. I hope that progress can be made soon for the good of all harbour users.Thanking Cllr Devlin for her work to improve safety for sea swimmers at the harbour, South Down MLA Colin McGrath said he looked forward to ldquomuch-needed changes in Newcastle.He also believes that the series of measures outlined for the harbour could be used as a template by the local authority for open water swimming and cold water therapy across the district.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are fortunate to be surrounded by such beautul coastline which has many locations for accessing the water, but itrsquos vital that we make the activity as safe as possible in a select number of locations that ensure an equitable offering across the council area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  February 12th%2C 1992  ","story":"ARDGLASS ndash The fishing fleet in Ardglass is facing a potential crisis following a slump in the crucially-important prawn market.Demand for prawns has ped dramatically because of the recession, resulting in depressed prices and trawler men struggling to meet running costs.Yesterday, fishermenrsquos leader Dick James said: ldquoWe are not yet in a crisis, but one is fast developing.Mr James, who is chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fish Producersrsquo Organisation, has called on the Government to introduce a decommissioning scheme which would enable trawler owners to leave the industry.ldquoA decommissioning scheme would go a long way towards solving the problem. At present, we have too many boasts chasing too few fish, he remarked.Ironically, the situation has been partly caused by the fishermen catching too many prawns.Last monthrsquos good weather resulted in better-then-expected landing which further depressed the already-weakened market ndash prawn are currently selling at less than pound a stone, compared to pound a stone a year ago.However, the general recession in the economy has been the main stumbling block. As demand continues to drop, processors are keeping stocks in cold storage and are not in a position to buy additional supplies at the quayside.ldquoWe had good prices until last April. Then the market slumped and prices drop. Unfortunately, fishermanrsquos costs havenrsquot come down accordingly, Mr James said.Mr James said depression in other sectors of the industry has heightened the problem.He also believes the decommission scheme has the support of most trawler owners in Ardglass.ldquoWe are talking about the survival of the fleet as a whole. Decommissioning would help owners who are otherwise unable to get out of the industry.ldquoAnd because most of the boats are undermanned, it would to not lead to large scale redundancies among crewmen, he added.CROSSGAR ndash A Crossgar man who is renowned for his excellent time-keeping was honoured last week.Mr James McCormick, who has been winding the clock on the old Kilmore Parish Church Hall for over  years, has decided to hang up his key and retire from his conscientious job.James took over the job when the clock was repaired in  and has continued his labour of love ever since.Now the hall has been sold to the Ulster Wildle Trust for its new headquarters building, James has decided tocall it a day and has retired from his winding duties.In recognition of his timeless work over the years the development officer of the Wildle Trust, Mr Niall Timmins, presented Mr McCormick with a window box of herbs to remind him of his former winding le.STRANGFORD ndash The creation of a single committee to oversee the management of Strangford Lough has been widely welcomed.The Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, Mr John Taylor, said the announcement represents a ldquomajor U-turn by the Government, while the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association described it as a ldquoserious attempt to ensure the future of the lough.The new committee is to be launched in the spring and will have a membership of around  drawn from special interest groups, such as agriculture, fishing, conservation and recreation.Member will also be appointed from nominations put forward by Down District and Ards Borough Councils, the National Trust and the Council for Nature Conservation and the Countryside.The announcement marks something of a turn-around by the Environment Minister, Mr Richard Needham, who less than six months ago proposed a two-tier management structure for the lough.The proposal was widely criticised by groups who argued that such a structure would be unwieldy and would prevent local people from having a proper influence over decision making.By scrapping that approach, Mr Needham appears to have bowed to local pressure. The Minister says the new initiative has been produced ldquofollowing extensive consultation with organisations and iniduals concerned with the future of Strangford Lough.SAINTFIELD ndash Work is to start next week leading to the provision of new traffic lights in Saintfield.The townrsquos Ulster Unionist councillor, Mr William Biggerstaff, said yesterday that preliminary work will begin on Monday for the provision of the lights at the main crossroads in the town.ldquoI welcome this commitment. At long last we are to get these light, he said.After meeting Roads Service officials, Mr Biggerstaff also announced progress on a number of other projects in the Saintfield area.He said the provision of a footpath along Middle Road is to go forward to the Departmentrsquos forward planning section, as well similar provision on the Ballynahinch Road, Saintfield, as far as Ballymaconnell Road.Mr Biggerstaff said he had also been assured that a footpath extension from Lislane Park to the new build on the Listooder Road, taking in the primary school area will ldquodefinitely happen this year.The Ulster Unionist councillor has also asked officials to carry out a study into a serious flooding problem during periods of heavy rain at Carsonstown Road Killybawn Road.NEWCASTLE ndash Down councillor, Mr John Ritchie, has claimed that the Eastern Health Board consultation process is the ldquokiss of death for Mourne House.In a strong address to the Eastern Health Council attacking the closer plan for Mourne House, Mr Ritchie said that in his experience consultation rarely results in a change to such a proposal.Mr Ritchie claimed the unit of management has looked at the Mourne House scenario from a narrow perspective and he voiced concern about the future of the elderly people in the outlying parts of the community.It was the local councillor who asked for the Mourne House issue to be put on the Council agenda for Thursdayrsquos meeting and he dominated the  minute discussion.During his address Mr Ritchie suggested the implementation of a two-year programme to deal with the renovations and the building could then be used as a base for a community care programme.Mr Ritchie explained that Mourne House first came to light in the dying days of the last Eastern Health Board when the policy and planning committee considered a plan for the Down and Lisburn Unit of Management.The proposal included reducing the number of beds to  and developing Mourne House as a base for a community care package with respite care, a  place day centre, and meals on wheels.Mr Ritchie said there were a whole range of suggestions which the Board felt made a ldquovery attraction option.CLOUGH ndash The Presbyterian congregation in Clough held a thanksgiving service on Sunday to bid farewell to their  year-old church hall which is being replaced.The hall which was built in , is being demolished to make way for a new hall which will be officially opened by the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church, the Rev Rodney Sterritt, in April.The services was conducted by the Rev Robert Craig, church minister, who researched the origins and construction of the hall at the turn of the century.The hymn, psalm and ure reading were the same as those used at the opening service.The ious organisations which used the hall over the years were remembered, including the Scouts and Guides, Boysrsquo and Girlsrsquo Brigades, the Girlsrsquo auxiliary, and the badminton, bowls and table tennis clubs.The congregation also remembered the many services and church socials which were held in the hall.In his address, Mr Craig pointed to the strong links between the current congregation and that of a bygone age.He said many of the original families still reside in the Clough area and belong to the congregation.Mr Craig said the congregation is still industrious and is currently busy erecting and paying for the new hall.

Fortunately for The Blues they had an able replacement in Christopher Magee.This early unsettlement, along with the travelling support, spurred the away side on and soon the league leaders were showing why they are just that.Gareth Keenan was denied a golden opportunity courtesy of a point blank save from Turley as Comber continued to apply pressure in the early stages. Kilmore responded well to this and remained calm on the ball.Following some quick passing from Matthew Stewart to team-mate Anton McGrattan, the Kilmore number ten played in strike partner Joe McKinney, who was adjudged to have been fouled in the danger area and won a penalty kick.Kilmorersquos McGrattan stepped up but his effort was fantastically saved by the outstretching Andrew Topping, who pushed the ball around the post and out for a corner to the frustration of the home fans.The resultant corner was headed over the Comber crossbar by Kilmore defender Jack Larkin as the away side relished in escaping potential punishment.The visitors went back in search of the opening goals immediately after, with Keenan again seeing his efforts thwarted by the Kilmore custodian.The game quickly developed into an end to end contest with chances coming thick and fast at both ends.Kilmorersquos McKinney saw his headed effort go wide with the goal seemingly gaping before his left footed effort blazed over the bar after he was neatly played through by McGrattan.Comberrsquos Brandon Nelson delivered an inviting corner to the head of team-mate Stuart Moore, although he failed to make the most of his chance.Despite the weather, things began heating up on the pitch with numerous crunching tackles on display.Kilmore captain, Niall McCarthy, escaped with just a warning following his high challenge on Comber winger Nelson although the visiting sidersquos Moore wasnrsquot as lucky after he was awarded a yellow for clattering substitute Magee.A new face was on show within the Kilmore ranks in the form of midfielder Barry Walsh. The former Killyleagh YC player impressed throughout his debut and controlled the middle of the park at ious stages throughout the game.With both the tempo and tensions high, the whistle sounded a full two minutes early to signal half-time.Comber kicked off after the interval but it was the hosts who would be awarded the first big chance of the half.Following a piercing run into the opposing defence, Kilmorersquos McKinney was brought down awarding team-mate McGrattan to test lsquokeeper Topping from  yards with the resultant free-kick.However, the Comber custodian wasnrsquot required to spring into action as the ball whisked past the wrong side of the upright.The visitors seemed to be pressed further back into their half and attempted to respond quickly.Dylan Wilson smartly dispatched of the ball on a quick counter-attack to team-mate and captain, Simon Hanna, although the number eight was halted in his tracks unfairly by Magee.For this, the Kilmore defender was the latest name to enter the refereersquos books. The home side had the advantage of the wind and decided to use this repeatedly through long ranged passes in hopes of manufacturing an attack.McKinney came close on a few occasions as he engaged in multiple footraces with Comberrsquos Reece Whittle, although often the home striker would stray onto the bounds of offside.Kilmore hit a purple patch in the opening quarter of the second half, with Comberrsquos first chance of the restart coming on the hour mark.Nelson was left unmarked at the back post after a ball was lofted into his path from skipper Hanna. However, he shanked his left-footed effort and allowed his Kilmore counterparts to remain unscathed.Despite this miss, Nelsonrsquos effort served as a reminder to the opposition that Comber was very much still a threat on the counter.The Kilmore support were up in arms minutes later when they thought a Comber hand was used to prevent a McGrattan strike from hitting its target, although these appeals were quickly shut down.Comber substitute, Ciaran Gillan, picked up a yellow card in his attempts to clear the ball from his half ndash much to the disagreement of his sidersquos management team.The visitors would be soon ruing more than a yellow card as the resultant free-kick proved costly on the  minute mark.A delicately placed McGrattan delivery floated into the path of captain McCarthy for the Kilmore skipper to head with conviction past Topping and finally open the scoring.Anton McGrattan picked up a rather needless yellow soon after for thumping the ball away amongst the celebrations as the atmosphere inside the park reached fever pitch.Comber defender Bradley Porter received a yellow card minutes later for his tackle on McKinney before the Kilmore striker suffered the same fate after he ended up on the ground in what the referee deemed as simulation.The trend of yellow cards continued with Comber captain Hanna, who landed his name in the book for exchanging some ill-advised words with the official ten minutes from full-time.As expected, the final minutes of the contest were a nervous affair for the home side, who werenrsquot committing as many bodies forward in hopes of securing a shutout.Naturally, this invited pressure from Comber, who desperately sought to spoil the Kilmore party.lsquoKeeper Turley kept his concentration for the full duration of the match and thwarted the last two efforts from Comber, with Wilson coming close before his team-mate Tumilson was denied dramatically in injury time.This signied the last piece of action as the referee brought his whistle to his lips to the relief of the Kilmore support.Following the conclusion goal scorer and man of the match, Niall McCarthy, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos impressive victory.ldquoIt was a battle, the pitch was very heavy and I think it just came down to who wanted it more, he said.ldquoWe knew with Comber coming down here that they are a very physical, very fit team, who are well-drilled.ldquoHowever, we firmly believe in our camp that we are the best team in the league. We work hard every Tuesday and Thursday night and itrsquos a credit to our manager, Michael Carvill, for the shape hersquos pulled us in to.Kilmore: C Turley, J McCarthy, M Stewart, J Larkin, G Kennedy, B Walsh, J Smyth, N McCarthy , J McKinney, A McGrattan, E McGrattan.Subs: C Magee, M Monan, M Carvill.Yellow cards: C Magee, A McGrattan, J McKinney.Comber: A Topping, M Gibson, L Walker, B Porter, R Whittle, S Moore, B Nelson, S Hanna , D Wilson, M Tumilson, G Keenan.Subs: S Fleck, C Gillan, K Gaw.Yellow cards: S Moore, C Gillan, B Porter, S Hanna..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Knockevin in £75k funding initiative  ","story":"KNOCKEVIN Special Schoolrsquos Parent Staff Association has unveiled details of an ambitious pound, fundraising initiative.The school has bases in Downpatrick, Dundrum and Castlewellan, with the parent and staff group hoping that the ldquoenchantment project will raise vital funds to purchase essential outdoor play and learning equipment.In addition, some of the pound, will be used to meet school bus running costs and other essential items at Knockevinrsquos three bases.Announcing details of the new fundraising initiative, the parent and staff group said pupils are in need of ious items to help combat social deprivation as a result of the ongoing pandemic.ldquoOur children may not always have the same opportunity for social inclusion as those in mainstream education, but to be able to provide them with an outdoor space they can safely and comfortably enjoy together which is fully accessible and tailored to all their needs would be a dream come true, said a spokesperson for the group.ldquoOur children and young adults are most deserving of this. and, as with all specialist equipment, a large price tag is included and we aim to hold as many fundraising activities and events as possible to ensure that we reach our goal.As Covid restrictions continue to ease, the highly acclaimed special school will be able to hold its th anniversary at Newcastlersquos Burrendale Hotel on September , with entertainment provided by the Booze Bros and Finbarr Keaveney the compere for the evening.ldquoWe are looking forward to getting together again to celebrate all that has been achieved in the past  years.

However, by pm the taped route was ready, the registration was complete and the nervous but excited youngsters were warming up in anticipation.Primary Four and under lined up, first the boys and then the girls. With vests down to their knees and a few anxious glances to parents, it seemed that they were almost too young for such a task but once the whistle blew they set off like rockets round the m circuit.Harry McVeigh, for Newcastle AC, was the clear winner in the boysrsquo race and Aoe Maguireheld a five second lead to win the girlsrsquo race.Primary Five saw the girls and boys combined in the one race and the winners were John McElroyand Emily Kerr . The  metres didnrsquot seem a bother to either of these young athletes.Ryan Thorntonwent off hard for the P win and Saorlaith McAleenanwas the epitome of focus as she headed to the line to come first in the P girls.With  entrants and the distance now one kilometre, it was a challenging race.The P looked an experienced bunch as they gathered at the start.Many have been racing each other in the Flahavanrsquos XC Series for schools so there were scores to be settled. Maisie McVeighwas taking no chances and after a short tussle, she shrugged off the rest of the field and ran solo to take the P girlsrsquo victory.Fiachna McAleenanalso showed his mettle leading home the P boys. This was raced over m.It was great to see the support for the younger ones, not just from parents but from older siblings and club mates, who ran along side each race yelling at the younger ones to encourage them to work hard right to the finish line.On more than one occasion there were groups breaching the line as an inseparable unit and joint times had to be awarded. This was exciting for spectators and a learning experience for the runners.In time they will develop the ability to pace over the course to keep their position but leave a little in the tank for a sprint finishrequired.The series is about participation as well as competition and all runners get a point for their club provided they finish the race.This helps to engender club spirit and creates a charged atmosphere.The post primary runners were well warmed up from their cheerleading efforts on the sideline so they were primed for racing when it was eventually their turn.In Years Eight, Nine and Ten, the girls outnumbered the boys in each category but by Year  plus, it was the reverse.Still, it was good to see healthy numbers out to take part overall in the post primary end of things. The distance for year eight was m and Erin Easton , who won the girlsrsquo race by eight seconds, looked controlled throughout. Aaron OrsquoBoylehad an exciting sprint to the line to snatch glory in Year Eight boys.Emma Stewartcovered the m Year Nine girlsrsquo race at great speed to place first girl and Alex Robinson seemed to revel in the extra running as the gap between him and the second runner stretched out as the race proceeded.Year Ten boys and girls ran together as there were  when combined.The m race allowed spectators to get multiple glimpses as the they looped round the field.Aaron Lennonwon his race comfortably and Edana Butterfieldhad a similar outcome in the girlsrsquo category.The finale was Year  and up. This had a mix of gender as well as year groups. The athletes seemed to have doubled in height compared to the first race of the day and they looked powerful and committed as they loped past with long strides.The two kilometre race was a display of pacing and control with the speed picking up in the last lap.Ollie Robinsonmade sure he held his lead to the line and Amy McCartanran strongly to come first in the girlsrsquo section.Racing completed there was a flurry to clear up before the next shower and many hands made light work.Thanks are due to all the volunteers ndash both those who are involved on the day and those who do the admin behind the scenes. The commitment of the young runnersis highly commendable and the continued backing of McGrady Financial Services is much appreciated.These young folk are the future of our clubs and the sport in general and all those who are facilitating this, know that it is time well spent.The next race is in Tollymore Forest Park on March .

Finnerty eventually notched the next score for his Galway outfit, before the goal scorer, Conroy, would kick over from distance ndash albeit with some wind assistance.The hosts seemed to fighting an uphill battle as the wind battered around Pairc Esler in favour of the visiting side, with Conroy once again managing to point from long range.This opened up a five point winning margin with the Mourne men desperately needing scores on the board.However, the weather could not be at fault for all of their shortcomings as they struggled with the impressive Galway forward line.Walsh was once again involved when he surged past the Down defence before setting up team-mate Owen Gallagher for an easy score.Cormac McCartan attempted to get the home side back into the contest with what seemed like an easy kick over from  metres, although the wind made sure the ball hung in the air before ping comfortably into the hands of Galway lsquokeeper Conor Flaherty.Downrsquos Andrew Gilmore did convert his point three minutes later but as per the theme of the match, Galway replied quickly through Tomo Culhane, who took the mark and scored at the other end.Galway introduced the ing Damien Comer to the fray and with his first touch of the ball he also took the mark and made no mistake with his chance to secure another point for the visitors.Walsh was relishing the blustery conditions and was firing from will at all angles, with one such effort sailing over the black spot from around  metres before the half-time whistle.This signied the last score of a half that contained very few positives for McCartanrsquos side.Half-time: Down - Galway -.The Mourne men registered the opening score of the second half, courtesy of a Barry OrsquoHagan free.Two minutes later, home supporters were perhaps left a little surprised when a goal opportunity presented itself but Cormac McCartan opted instead to play it safe and fire over the bar.Nevertheless, Down had scored two points answered and soon OrsquoHagan would ensure a third after he took the mark and converted the chance.OrsquoHagan continued his impressive start to the second half when he kicked over once again following a turnover in possession.It was now Galway who was struggling with the wind, with Kieran Molloy witnessing his straightforward point from  metres halted by the breeze.Passionate ranting from Down manager, James McCartan, saw him pick up a yellow after exchanging words with the fourth official but there was no denying his side at their tails up.A wide mark from Galwayrsquos Paul Kelly encouraged the hosts further but Gallagher eventually notched his sidersquos first point after the interval following twenty minutes of action.Despite all of Downrsquos hard work, the scoreboard still favoured the visitors by five points in what was a sobering reminder of the home outfitrsquos poor first half display.It didnrsquot help the hosts when Comer notched the next score before Walsh followed suit with a trio of converted frees.Galway attempted to inflict further damage at the death as Tony Gill barrelled down on goal, although he was dragged down before he could unleash his shot.Continuing his impressive kicking form from frees, Walsh once again converted to complete his sidersquos scoring.However, it would be Downrsquos Gilmore who would register the final score of the contest with the last kick of the game, as he curled his left-footed effort over the bar in added time.Following the final whistle, Down manager James McCartan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe are disappointed, the game was closer than the six point margin but we lost it in the first half, he said.ldquoWe let Galway play and we werenrsquot putting bodies on the line. I challenged the guys at half-time and there was a big improvement in the first twenty minutes of the second half.ldquoGalway hit us on the break and they went and got a couple of late scores to put a bit of gloss on it.

As we emerge from the pandemic, more people will choose to visit the resort where there are exciting plans in place to provide even more for things for people to do and see.ldquoNewcastle and many parts of the wider district boast some of the most spectacular scenery anywhere in the world and the one thing that people can be assured of when they visit is a warm Irish welcome. ldquoCllr Clarke said that over recent years, investment to overhaul the promenade and the Main Street through the heart of the resort has paid a handsome idend.ldquoWhile the resort enjoys many international visitors, Newcastle is also a top destination for day-trippers which provides the townrsquos economy with a signicant boost and helps safeguard many jobs, he said.ldquoWe have the Mournes, the sea, forest parks, golf courses and nearby Murlough which all add to the great package Newcastle has to offer.ldquoThe calibre of cafes, bars and restaurants are top notch and it is no surprise that the resort is noted for the high level of its hospitality services. These all add to the experience that the town provides.Cllr Clarke said while Covid had a major impact on the tourism industry, with spring and summer on the horizon, Newcastle will be ready to offer the warm welcome to visitors that the resort is noted for.In addition, he said the fact that Newcastle is regarded as one of the top friendliest visitor destinations is testament to the efforts of so many people, from tourism providers to local businesses and residents to a raft of statutory organisations, including Newry, Mourne and Down Council.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoIt is tremendous that the collective efforts and ard work of so many people has been rewarded with the people who come to Newcastle voting it one of the most friendliest places they have visited..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_Owl.jpg","title":"Rare barn owls return to  nest at Finnebrogue estate  ","story":"RARE and vulnerable barn owls have ed to nest at the Finnebrogue estate, near Downpatrick.There are believed to be fewer than  breeding pairs of barn owls in Northern Ireland, but their population has been given a much-needed boost with the discovery of a new nest site.The Finnebrogue estate is nestled along the banks of the Quoile river with an expanse of  acres of mixed farm land with half given over to the environment.In January last year, bird boxes were placed around the farm in the hope of attracting breeding barn owls over the winter.Following the use of thermal imaging in April, a pair were discovered nesting in one of the boxes.Commenting on the exciting find, Mark Sandford, Finnebrogue farm manager, said: ldquoHaving only placed nesting boxes up in , it took no time for a barn owl pair to settle. This is testament to our land management, meaning there is ample food resources available for them.He continued: ldquoBarn owl diet consists of mainly wood mice, pygmy shrews and young rats, which in turn are attracted to the estatersquos mature woodland and areas of grass scrubland which regularly throw out grain to encourage a good population of rodents.ldquoWe hope that these barn owls will keep coming back year after year and continue to add vital numbers to our small and vulnerable Northern Irish population.Mark is receiving support from Ulster Wildle through their barn owl conservation work.Katy Bell, Senior Conservation Officer, explains why this pair is so important.ldquo has been a dficult year for our already struggling barn owl population. The wet and extremely hot weather meant that most of our barn owl nest sites failed, so we were thrilled to hear this news.ldquoLuckily, this pair couldnrsquot have chosen a more sympathetic farm to set up home with wild bird cover, meadows and mature hedgerows providing plentul foraging habitat and food for barn owls to thrive.She continued: ldquoWith fewer than  breeding pairs of barn owls estimated to be left in Northern Ireland, farmers and landowners play a key role in securing their future.ldquoBy working together, we can help protect precious nest sites, monitor these beautul birds and provide help and advice on owl-friendly farming.The chicks were kindly ringed by David Galbraith, a licenced volunteer ringer from the British Trust for Ornithology .This will generate important information on the birdsrsquo survival, productivity and movement - and is non-invasive as the birds remain sleepy during the process.Barn owls are legally protected and can be sensitive to disturbance, soyou find a nest site, please leave it alone and get in touch with Ulster Wildle.Tell-tale signs to look for include distinctive whitewash pings, feathers and regurgitated pellets of bones and fur.

In the opening  minutes a number of early misdemeanours from the travelling team in the tackle, at the breakdown and at scrum led to Friends dominating territory and possession as the game got up and running.Within this period the home team gathered up an eight-point lead through a well struck penalty following a Down High tackle and a quick tapped free kick on the Down five metre line after the front row had been judged to have pushed early in a scrum, which led to a try for the hosts. As the game moved into its middle stages, Down began to find their way back into the game with some eye catching counter attacks from their back three.Meanwhile half backs, George Thompson at scrum half and Ben Cassidy at out half, kicked well at key moments in spite of the wind, to capitalise on space left by Friends in their back field.Just before half time it was following one of these kicks that Down earned a penalty on the Friends ten metre line.Cassidy kicked to the corner and off the resulting line out Down mauled close to Friends line before Ryan Halpin saw an opportunity to barge over the whitewash for a well worked try.Cassidy then reduced arrears to one point with an accurate conversion.Down entered the second half confident with the strong wind now very much in their favour.Things didnrsquot always go their way with some periods when the green defence was severely tested.However, around ten minutes into the half Halpin found himself back on the scoresheet to give Down High the lead for the first time as he strode clear of the covering defence off a well-timed pass from rumbling front row forward, Mark Jackson. Cassidy added the two points to give Down a six-point margin in their favour.With ten minutes to go, Halpin played a key role Downrsquos crucial third try. Captain, Brett Kelly who had an excellent day both in attack and defence, laid the foundations for this score executing a pre-planned set piece play.Following this, George Thompson spotted an overlap on the blindside with Halpin ending up on the ball in a two versus one scenario with full back Alex Watson outside him space.The pass was timed superbly and Watson ed over in the corner for an unconverted try to take the score to -.To their credit, the home side didnrsquot accept that Downrsquos  point lead was a done deal and for the closing ten minutes, applied plenty of pressure.Indeed Friends crossed the line with one minute remaining on the clock for an unconverted try leaving a nervy finish for Down High as they sought to protect their six point lead.The restart offered some territorial respite and all in the travelling squad and those supporting them leapt high with joy when a Friends knock-on gave the referee the cue to blow the final whistle with time well past the  minute mark.Down High now face Sullivan Upper at home in the semi-finals on Saturday, February . In other games at home last week, Down High third XV bowed out of their plate competition at the quarter-final stage with a narrow - loss to Campbell College fourth XV in what was an entertaining fixture, while a select U-  team defeated Wellington College -.The other plaudits of the weekend went to the U- A team, who produced a captivating performance to defeat RBAI - on Saturday morning.The U- B and Cs, also playing RBAI, lost but put in some proud performances demonstrating the impressive depth in this squad..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13477255.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The spending plan had been out for public consultation when the DUP withdrew first minister Paul Givan from the administration as part of its protest against Brexit’s Northern Ireland Protocol.The draft budget had proposed a % increase in health spending in Northern Ireland, with £ billion earmarked for services over the next three years.The plan would have left other departments facing some tough choices as a result of the % cash increase for the health budget.While none of the other departments would have seen a reduction in their baseline allocation from the last budget, they would have been % down on what they would have expected to receiveextra funding were not being erted to health.“Since the resignation of the first minister I have considered all possible avenues that might have allowed me to proceed with a budget, including bringing it directly to the Assembly,” Mr Murphy told MLAs on Tuesday.“Unfortunately, the legal advice is clear that the budget must be agreed by the executive.“This means that on April  the health service will not be able to plan on a three-year basis, nor will it be equipped with additional resources to invest in waiting lists, cancer services and mental health.“In these circumstances, rather than improving, the health service will decline.”Mr Murphy said he had decided to pause the public consultation exercise on the draft budget.“Last week the Health Ministerapologised to people on waiting lists because without a multi-year budget, the opportunity to rebuild the health service would be ‘cruelly taken away’,” he said.“That analysis is sadly correct, although it should be the DUP apologising for the damage it is inflicting on the health service, not Minister Swann.”On the ability of spending hundreds of millions of carried over funds next year, Mr Murphy said: “Departments cannot plan to make use of this additional £ million in funding.“Instead the money will sit idle, until such times as an executive is re-established.”Mr Murphy said he would make a £ million in-year reallocation of Stormont funds to ensure the administration did not breach the limit of underspent cash it can carry over into the next financial year.This money will go to the departments of communities, education and infrastructure.“Having considered this matter at some , and taken legal advice, I intend to proceed to make allocations to these departments,” he said.“I have written to ministers to ask them for their views on this course of action and have made clear to them that the alternative is that funding that could be used to support local people and services might instead be lost to the Treasury.”Mr Murphy also highlighted the need to provide match funding for community groups supported through the European Social Fund .He urged DUP Economy Minister Gordon Lyons to prioritise the ESF match funding from within his own budget.The draft budget had proposed a continuation of the current freeze on both the domestic and non-domestic regional rates for the next three years.Mr Murphy said that freeze could now only be continued for one year.“This freeze was intended to help with the rising costs being faced by families and businesses alike,” he said.“On the basis of legal advice, I can proceed with this freeze for one year only.“That means that households and businesses will not have certainty on their rates for the subsequent two years.”Mr Murphy said he would proceed with a proposed £ million rate relief package for businesses.The package would deliver a three-month rates holiday for sectors hit hardest by the pandemic, retail, tourism, hospitality, leisure, childcare, newspapers and airports.“The executive should be on the cusp of agreeing a multi-year budget which prioritises health,” Mr Murphy added.“It should be deciding how to invest an additional £ million next year for housing, for skills, for the police, and for ESF match funding.“Due to the reckless actions of the DUP, this is not possible.“Instead, public services will operate on an emergency basis, without the benefits of long-term planning or additional resources, until such times as the executive is re-established.”Mr Murphy’s appearance before MLAs witnessed some sharp exchanges with DUP members.DUP MLA Keith Buchanan accused the minister of “amnesia”, highlighting that Sinn Fein pulled down the administration in  and left the region without a budget.“Minister, I see in your statement the Democratic Unionist Partyhas been mentioned four times but strangely no mention of your own party when they pulled this entire Assembly down in early  – no budget, no health support, no nothing,” he said.“Surely a case of amnesia from the members on the far side of the house, purely for political gain.“Can you and other parties not see the damage the Northern Ireland Protocol is doing to this place, are you blind to seeing that ”Mr Murphy insisted that the renewable heat incentivecontroversy that prompted the collapse of powersharing in  would have brought down any coalition government.He told Mr Buchanan: “Your party’s decision in order to scramble to save your own seatsis having very real consequences, a lot of them apparently unforeseen or not thought through by your party, is having very real consequences for the communities that we represent and you should own that yourself.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our

TUV has always been clear that unionists need to vote down the ballot for all pro-Union candidates in the order of their preference.

The Ulster Unionist Party believes the Northern Ireland electorate are more than capable of deciding for themselves who they should give their transfers to. “They need to be trusted more and dictated to less. It is up to each party to set out their vision for Northern Ireland to attract first preference votes and transfers.”The issue of maximising unionist votes has come to the fore even more than usual as unionists discuss how to respond to claims from some polls that Sinn Fein could emerge as the largest single party in this election.This has caused intense debate about whether Sinn Fein could take the First Minister position for the first time.Loyalist activist Jamie Bryson responded: “The party of Carson and Craig flatly refuse to encourage transfers to other unionists. This comes only a few short years after the ‘vote Mike get Column’ debacle whereby the UUP urged voters to transfer to the SDLP.“It is clear the soul of the once proud UUP has been taken captive by a small cabal of liberals who believe that Twitter is the real world and that the praise being heaped on them by nationalists will translate into votes.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe law changes on Monday, March , removing the legal defence of reasonable punishment and opening the possibility for anyone who smacks a child to be prosecuted for assault.The Welsh Government passed the law change two years ago, seeing off opposition in the Senedd to win a vote - on what was described as a “landmark day for children in Wales”The government said the law change would help “protect children and their rights, and give them the best start in le”. By banning smacking, ministers argue children in Wales are now given the same protections from assault as adults.Physical punishmentis \"not a necessary part of disciplining children\" and \"doesn’t help children learn about self-control or appropriate behaviour\", the Welsh Government advises, adding that such punishments can hurt children and give them the message violence is an \"appropriate response to strong feelings\".The new law will apply to everyone in Wales, including visitors, and £. million is being invested in parenting support services.Advice and support for parents and s is available on the Welsh Government’s Give It Time website https:gov.wales parenting-give-it-time.Children’s charities like Barnardo’s Cymru and the NSPCC have supported the law change, but the ban has not been welcomed universally.As well as some opposition in the Senedd, mainly from the Welsh Conservatives, a campaign group called Be Reasonable argued the move would “inevitably catch ordinary, loving parents and turn them into criminals”, and their petition against the government’s proposals collected nearly , signatures in Wales.And the Welsh Government’s own studies suggest members of the public are equally ided over the issue.Researchers carried out three surveys between  and  to gauge public opinion on banning the physical punishment of children..removeWhile support for a smacking ban grew in , research shows that level fell slightly a year later. If anything, people’s opinions have become less rigid, with more people in  than in previous years saying they would need more information before deciding whether they agreed with the law change.Among those members of the public who said they supported a smacking ban in the last survey, more than one-thirdsaid they did not agree generally with the physical punishment of children.Other common reasons for supporting the ban included the belief there were other good forms of ensuring good behaviour and discipline , and the belief smacking was abuse, or could lead to abuse .Meanwhile, one in four peoplewho said they opposed the smacking ban in the most recent survey did so because they believed physical punishment was needed to control behaviour, the discipline a child, to teach respect or to show boundaries.Other common reasons for opposing the law change included the belief smacking doesn’t do any harm– including cases when people said it hadn’t done themselves or their own children any harm – and that smacking was OKit was a reasonable punishment and doesn’t go too far.Not everyone who smacks a child from March  will be automatically prosecuted. Wales four police forces have been encouraged to consider a \"rehabilitative alternative to prosecution\"this is more appropriate.\"In cases where the police decide it is appropriate to offer an out of court disposal, there will be an option of tailored parenting support to encourage positive parenting techniques and help avoid re-offending,\" the government has advised.Those parenting support schemes will be offered by councils. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityBute Cottage Nursery is set to merge with Evenlode Primary under Vale of Glamorgan council plans opposed by hundreds.The council’s cabinet was urged to rethink the merger, with some councillors claiming not enough attention was given to a public consultation where most people opposed the plan.Cllr George Carroll, leader of the Conservative group on the Vale council, called in the merger decision to be looked at by the learning and culture scrutiny committee.He said: “That’s a clear and signicant majority of consultees who were opposed to this proposal. Insufficient consideration was made regarding those consultations responses.”The scrutiny committee, which met on Thursday, February , also heard from parents, governors and trade union representatives about their concerns over the merger.Richard Disley, chair of governors at Bute Cottage, said: “It’s been dficult to get our voices heard during this process. Our concerns have always been about the wellbeing of our staff. If the amalgamation happens, the current positions of the majority of nursery staff are only guaranteed for  months.“Long-serving permanent staff members who are in our current budget have job stability, will now only have guaranteed work for  months. Staff haven’t been offered any support from the local authority during this very stressful time.“Bute Cottage should be held up as an example of how things should be done, not merged into a primary school with the sole purpose of fitting into a – year model, for which there is no proof of improved outcomes for children. We have asked for evidence on a number of occasions but none has been forthcoming.”Kate Rees, a parent whose children went to Bute Cottage, said: “It was disappointing that there wasn’t more consideration for the issues we raised. Bute Cottage has its own headteacher, budget, governing body, and specialist staff. Those are the magic ingredients that come together to create the exceptional setting for education..remove“I have three children. All three of them were lucky enough to go to Bute Cottage, and they all attend Evenlode now, and Bute Cottage was just a really wonderful experience for them. I got to know that nursery really well. Because of that I’m absolutely passionate about the provision there.”Concerns over the merger include the possible relocation of the nursery to the Evenlode Primary School site, although this would be several years away and only a potential move and a change in the teaching style. The Vale council has said the merger would help provide continuity and stability for pupils to attend the same school from three to eleven years.Cllr Rhiannon Birch said the concerns were overblown and “disappointing”, and added high teaching standards would be kept after the merger.She said: “They will have the same staff, there will be the same guiding ethos, there will be the same standards of professionalism. To hear some of these speakers, you would think these children are going to be put in a field to poke each other with sticks, rather than having an education.“It’s very disappointing their lack of trust in teaching professionals who will continue to maintain high standards, to provide pastoral care, education and all the dferent aspects of nursery education. It seems to me incredible to believe that all of this should be going out of the window simply because we’re talking about the governing body.”Cllr Lis Burnett, cabinet member for education, said no changes to staff will be made as part of the merger, which would be restricted to how the school and nursery are governed.She said: “A consultation is not a referendum. It’s where we listen to views to see whether there’s any reason why the agreed policy … should not be applied. The nurseries would only be merged at a governance and leadership level, and there would be no change to where they’re operating. Those nurseries are not moving.“There will be no change to staffing or surroundings. There’s no reason to think that anything in terms of teaching and standards of learning in these schools will be altered in any way at all.”Asked about a potential future feasibility study into relocating the nursery next to Evenlode, she said: “Because you would want to see whether you have the best model, and whether it would be betterit were on one site. I’m on record as saying I don’t think it would be feasible.“But there were comments of people who don’t have cars, who live in the Evenlode catchment area, and actually walk from lower Penarth up to the nursery every day and back.“So you have to do a feasibility [study], to see whether or not that would work. But there is such a workload on the st Century Schools team, that unless it was prioritised, it would be a number of years before we could even look at it with the amount of other work.”If approved, the merger of the nursery and the primary school would take effect in September this year. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

A customer wearing a face mask as a precautionary measure against spreading Covid-. Picture: Getty“With the reduced threat from the Omicron iant, we can move away from an emergency and legalistic framework to a new approach where making safer choices is embedded in our daily lives,” said Mr Swann.“That means all of us continuing to do our best to cut down risks of infection and transmission. It means looking after each other by following the public health guidance. “It must always be remembered that taking unnecessary risks with Covid may affect people who are particularly vulnerable to the virus.”“So please do not jump the gun and start behaving asthe pandemic is over. That is not the case.“While Omicron is less severe than previous strains of the virus, community transmission remains very high and hospital pressures signicant. The most vulnerable as a result of underlying disease remain susceptible to severe illness and it is important that we all do what we can to protect them.”Mr Swann continued: “Coronavirus is likely to stay with us in some form for some time. We cannot maintain emergency restrictions indefinitely. A large part of what we currently do to protect ourselves is already covered by guidance rather than regulations. “This includes self-isolating when infected and taking lateral flow tests before meeting up with others. The guidance will continue to emphasise all the steps that we should keep taking to protect each other.“I will, of course, keep the situation on regulations under ongoing and detailed review. We cannot rule out a new iant emerging down the line with new interventions being required. I very much hope that will not be the case.”The Health Minister made yesterday’s announcement having received the latest public health assessment from the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientic Adviser.Minister Swann added: “The expectation from the public health assessments is that no signicant rise in ICU occupancy is expected.“While many people will very much welcome my decision on regulations, I know there will be concerns. Community transmission is still very high and our hospitals remain under severe pressure.“A sustained effort to follow the public health guidance will help reduce infection numbers and support our health service.”There are no plans at this stage for changes to the current arrangements for testing, contact tracing and isolation in Northern Ireland.The importance of wearing face coverings in health and social care settings, on public transport and in enclosed indoor settings will continue to be strongly emphasised.While Covid status certication will no longer be legally required in any settings, hospitality and entertainment venues will still be encouraged to use it. Vaccine certication will continue to be available to the public – including for those who need it for travel abroad to satisfy entry requirements of countries they are visiting.Read More Read MoreHealth Minister Robin Swann tests positive for Covid-Robin SwannCovid-OmicronHealth Minister  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularSchool run mum was over the drink-driving limit...NewsCovid-: Remaining restrictions to be lted in NI today...NewsTwo-vehicle crash at Dungannon closes road...NewsFuneral to take place for Fr Seamus McGinley, who died sudde...NewsIN PICTURES: Filming began in Dundonald last night of brand ...NewsMost PopularAldi’s popular hanging egg chair is back in stock - here’s h...RecommendedBest dehumidiers UK: keep your home warm and dry through w...Recommended Best weighted blankets UK : sleep better, calm anxiety w...RecommendedBest sports bras UK : best high support, shock-absorbing...RecommendedBest snow sled and tobaggans UK : sleds for adults and ...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dfeeadbdab   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bdffeacbceeffb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1644849796034.jpg--covid_19___mon_14th_february_figures.jpg?164484979600","title":"covid  mon th february figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows two further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

They are to be replaced by guidance after Mr Swann obtained support for the move from his fellow ministers. Social distancing, regulations on the number people allowed in homes and the COVID passport scheme are also gone. There are only a small number of restrictions left in place, said Mr Swann, who is isolating after testing positive for coronavirus, in his statement to the Assembly. In light of the current situation, and remembering the commitment that restrictions would only be in place as long as they are needed, I have decided that those remaining measures should no longer be set out in regulations. Instead, they should be placed in guidance to be followed by the public. I shall therefore be making an order on Tuesday, February  revoking the remaining restrictions and face-covering regulations. The relevant guidance will be updated.” He added that the changes do “not mean that Covid- has gone away or that we as a community are safe from its harm”. Mr Swann continued, “It is vitally important that we continue to observe the sensible measures we have all learnt to protect ourselves and others. Even with these powers in place however, it would almost certainly be impossible to introduce new restrictions in the absence of an Executive.
