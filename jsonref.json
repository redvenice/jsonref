A study carried out by Essity in the past year found that incontinence was seen as even more difficult to discuss than depression. Many doctors speak of male patients using their wives’ sanitary pads so they don’t end up with a soggy pair of boxers, or staying indoors due to “bladder leash” – the fear of not being able to locate a loo when leaving the house. When is male incontinence most likely to strike?There are different types of incontinence, with men most likely to experience “urge incontinence”. If you’ve ever felt a strong, unexplained impulse to pee, but find you’ve only got a few seconds to sprint to the bathroom, it’s probably urge incontinence. That’s why some men suffer “latchkey incontinence”, the sensation that the floodgates are about to open the moment you twist the key in your front door. Our internal plumbing is usually to blame for leakage, particularly overactive detrusor muscles. When these muscles contract too often (perhaps because you’ve had too much alcohol, too few fluids or even because you’re constipated), it can result in an uncontrollable urge to urinate at unforeseen moments, such as when you hear running water. Other factors that may make it harder to avoid dampness down under include being overweight or having had surgery for prostate cancer, which can result in weakened muscles. Men are also likely to experience post-micturition dribble, which causes a map-like stain to form on underpants after urinating. It’s often down to weakened pelvic floor muscles. What other types of incontinence are there?Men can also experience stress incontinence. That’s not “stress” as in feeling overwhelmed by a bulging inbox, but “stress” as in pressure. It happens when the bladder is put under sudden strain, such as coughing, sneezing, laughing or lifting weights in the gym, all of which can cause urine to leak, possibly because the pelvic floor muscles are weak. Incontinence can also be caused by overflow incontinence (also known as chronic urinary retention). This is when the bladder doesn’t entirely empty, resulting in a man passing small trickles of urine regularly, along with a feeling that the bladder is constantly full. How can I manage my incontinence so I can lead a normal life again?For starters, go and get a checkup with your GP to help you find out the cause. A trip to your GP may result in you being prescribed a course of antibiotics, or given advice on how lifestyle choices (see below) could alleviate symptoms. Until that’s addressed, and any changes kick in, many men have found the easiest way to manage their urine leakage is by using incontinence products, which allow them to enjoy the social activities they did before. Unsure where to start? Try TENA’s free Keep Control sample pack, which arrives discreetly packaged and allows you to road-test the incontinence tech that works best for you. This could be absorbent protective pads or underpants that look just like normal boxer shorts but keep nether regions dry. What else can I do to prevent bladder attacks?Not gulping down endless cups of tea and coffee during your working day can help, as caffeine is a diuretic that can increase the amount of urine you make. That said, it’s important to drink enough fluids so try to sip plenty of water throughout the day. Eating a healthy diet and keeping to a good weight is also beneficial, as being overweight puts pressure on the bladder. And don’t forget the pelvic floor, the muscles that hold the bladder and rectum in place. Men have less active pelvic floors than women so any exercises that strengthen them, such as pilates, are great.

Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

Arlene Foster descends from her chauffeur-driven Land Rover smiling, even though she has little to smile about.Northern Ireland’s first minister is the latest casualty of Brexit. She has, in her predecessor’s words, been “humiliated” and left as “roadkill” by her own colleagues. These are some of her last hours as leader of the Democratic Unionist party she is due to step down as first minister at the end of June.This year marks a century since the formation of Northern Ireland, and 50 years since the creation of the DUP, its hardline unionist party. Even now, the sharpness of their politics can surprise.A politician since the age of 25, Foster has been a polarising figure in a polarising political set-up. She came to UK prominence in 2017, when former prime minister Theresa May unexpectedly lost her parliamentary majority. The DUP had been seen as a fringe religious relic at Westminster. Suddenly its votes counted. Foster and colleagues extracted £1 billion in public spending in exchange for propping up May’s Conservative government. They were lauded as the master negotiators, the puppetmasters.But Brexit talks did not unfold to their advantage.Foster was outraged by May’s proposals, claiming they detached Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Boris Johnson took over, promised that he wouldn’t betray her, then did. His Brexit deal allowed customs checks in the Irish Sea, and he won a majority for it.By 2020, the DUP’s days of influence were over. Northern Ireland’s businesses and citizens were left with the mess of Brexit bureaucracy and disrupted identity. The DUP’s religious right, angered by Foster’s moderate line on abortion and banning gay conversion therapy, mobilised the ill-feeling to topple her.‘Lacking in strategy’To her critics, Foster is the leader who won the lottery, then tore up the winning ticket. “The art is knowing when to cash your chips in,” says one May supporter. “The DUP could be very adept tacticians, but they were utterly lacking in strategy,” says another. Many unionists can’t understand why the DUP has brought the union into question by supporting a hard Brexit, which most Northern Irish voters opposed.We are meeting in Fermanagh, the county where Foster grew up and still lives, the place that she comes for sanity. Here her influence remains. When I called to book a table for lunch, her chosen restaurant told me that it couldn’t serve lunch – it never serves lunch. Then they discovered that my guest was Foster, and the only questions were what time and any dietary requests. It turns out she supported the restaurant’s planning application. “Constituency work, you know?” she laughs, as we head inside.Fermanagh might offer a glimpse of Northern Ireland’s future. The constituency swings between electing unionists and nationalists. Sinn Féin has recently prevailed.All political careers end in failure, to paraphrase Enoch Powell, whose own political career ended in Northern Ireland. The real question is what happens to the ideas behind them.Neither Northern Ireland nor unionism is in great shape. Petrol bombs were thrown on the streets last month. A narrow majority of Northern Irish voters expect the region to leave the UK within 25 years. English voters like the Union flag, but their desire to accommodate Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales politically is in doubt.Meanwhile, Foster’s successor as DUP leader, Edwin Poots, is a traditionalist who does not believe in evolution. The party has fallen far behind Sinn Féin in polls.“For me, the union is a rational political ideal,” says Foster. She no longer trusts the DUP with it. She plans to leave the party altogether – refusing, extraordinarily, to remain in a club that won’t have her as a leader. Why?“Because I don’t agree with the direction of travel under Edwin’s leadership. I think we are regressing and becoming more narrow. It’s quite nasty, frankly. If the union is to succeed, we need to be a bigger tent . . . The plea I would make to the party is that, if they want to secure the union, then they have to have a wide vision for the union.”She is ready to rage against the dying of the light after all.‘Surprise me’Having a restaurant open especially for you certainly improves the choice of tables. Foster nods to one overlooking the lake, which the French proprietor Pascal assures us is “one of the most beautiful waters in the world for pike”.“I don’t have time to fish,” Foster laughs, before recognising her new reality. “I might be able to go out and fish now!” Pascal offers menus, but we decline. “You’re going to surprise me!” Foster tells him. The chef promises me “something very special”.Ian Paisley, the late founder of the DUP and the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, blasted alcohol as “the devil’s buttermilk”. Foster simply orders a glass of Sauvignon Blanc. She has been the modernising face of the DUP: a professional, a woman, an Anglican. Staunch unionism, however, was never optional.When she was eight, her father – a farmer and policeman – was shot in the head by the IRA. “I have a vivid memory of him crawling into the house on all fours, blood dripping from his head,” she says, tracing a line with a finger just above her eyebrow. Her father survived her mother’s hair turned white overnight.Aged 17, Foster survived a bomb attack on her school bus. Catholic and Protestant pupils rode the bus together but were never friends. It wasn’t until Foster became the first member of her family to go to university that she mixed with the other community.She entered politics as an Ulster Unionist. She opposed the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, in protest at the release of IRA prisoners, and in 2004 defected to the hardline DUP. By 2007 she was a minister. In 2016 she was first minister, sharing power with Sinn Féin.But two things happened almost immediately. First, the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal torched her technocratic image. This was an eco-scheme so badly designed that chicken farmers were paid to install boilers to heat empty sheds. It costs taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds.An inquiry revealed unrecorded meetings, incompetent officials and politicians unconcerned by wasteful spending because they (wrongly) thought that the UK Treasury was footing the bill. Foster took little responsibility, even though a whistleblower had contacted her with concerns.Then there was Brexit. The DUP was always Eurosceptic: Paisley, ever the anti-Catholic, claimed the European project reflected a “satanic power”. Foster’s stance was less clear. In June 2016, she tweeted more about the European football championship than the referendum. “I had been quite frustrated by state aid rules,” she says. “I wanted Brexit to happen.”But she distances herself from the consequences. “It has been a difficult period,” she tells me.‘Lots more to do’We tuck into our dishes – a medley of mushrooms and mussels for me, a coalition of blue lobster, sea bass and scallops for her. Among the Brexit difficulties were meetings with Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator. “He used to start off very suave in English, and then we would start about how this was disgraceful, and then he’d get angrier and angrier, until he started to speak in French!”What most rankles about the Brexit deal, she says, is that parcels from Britain now arrive with customs declarations. “It doesn’t matter if you are a unionist or a nationalist: if you are having to pay extra for something coming from the same country, it can be very distressing.”A 19-year-old loyalist representative, Joel Keys, told MPs this month that violence could not be taken off the table. “When you hear somebody as young as that talking about violence, it really does set you back in your shoes. We have lots more to do, especially in urban working-class areas.”On Brexit, her solution is that the protocol, which creates a special post-Brexit status for Northern Ireland, be altered “in a very fundamental way. There’s no point in tinkering around with it.“Look, I don’t doubt that Theresa’s a unionist and Boris is a unionist, but when it comes to a choice, we were the people who had to be sacrificed. Boris was almost myopic in his desire to get Brexit done.”Surely she has at least learnt not to trust the prime minister? He now literally has a bridge to sell her, connecting Northern Ireland and Scotland. Does she believe he will build it? “I hope so. It’s a tunnel now, is it not?” Come on, I say. She laughs. “He told me last Thursday that he was talking to the engineers in the afternoon. He wants to be Isambard Kingdom Brunel!”If the protocol is so bad, does she regret not toppling May in 2018? “No, because we did achieve quite a lot for Northern Ireland through the confidence-and-supply agreement. We are going to have the best broadband infrastructure in the whole of the UK.”So was there anything the DUP could have done differently? Foster exhales, and blames May for accepting there could be no Irish border checks. “All of the reasons I voted for Brexit are still good reasons. The difficulty has been the way in which the protocol has been worked through. And I think the Irish Government has a lot to answer for.”As I carve into some courgette, I recall Foster’s reason for leaving the Ulster Unionists in 2004 – that, time and time again, every problem was seen as “someone else’s fault”.A miserable familyThe DUP portrays itself as a family. Recent weeks have shown it to be a miserable one. Senior members circulated a letter of no confidence in Foster, but never gave it to her. Blindsided, she surrendered anyway. “There was a different way of doing it, but they chose to go in a very public way.”When Foster became first minister in 2016, Poots said her most important job would remain “that of a wife, mother and daughter”. How did she interpret that? “Well, how would you interpret it?” I know how my mother would interpret it: she’d be pretty annoyed. “Yeah . . . I’ve had everyday sexism since – women in politics just have to get on with things. But it was a very pointed remark.” Did he apologise? “Not at all.”Would her ousting have been different if she were a man? “I don’t know, I can’t answer that.” She has also fought a libel case over false internet claims that she has had an affair with a protection officer, winning £125,000 in damages.Coffee and profiteroles have arrived. The gentle landscape outside belies the political reality. Northern Ireland has survived a century because a majority of residents, and the British government, have underwritten it. But there are cracks. In the Stormont assembly, unionists no longer have a majority. One possibility is that Sinn Féin becomes the largest party at the next election, and the DUP refuses to serve under a Sinn Féin first minister. Is there a problem coming down the track? “There is – a real problem,” says Foster.Her own perceived intransigence over Brexit burnt through goodwill in the British Conservative party. Public spending in Northern Ireland is 20 per cent higher than the UK average, while public revenues are 16 per cent lower.“I know people in England sometimes get upset when they see how much subvention goes to Scotland and to Northern Ireland . . . We need to articulate why the union’s important.”I point out Foster is roughly as old as David Cameron when he left office. “I don’t know Lex Greensill!” she laughs. Would she accept a seat in the House of Lords? “I haven’t been offered a seat in the Lords, so I’ll wait to see what happens.” She also wants to encourage more women into politics.Splitting the billFoster is good company – not as grand as she is sometimes labelled. But after two hours with her, I can understand why the May government found her so hard to read. She talks reconciliation, then snaps back. She doesn’t quite engage, doesn’t quite take responsibility for the realities of where her policies have led. I sense that inviting Foster to lunch is one thing trying to split the bill with her would be another.Afternoon sun warms the table.“The local estate agents were telling me it’s crazy the amount of people looking for homes in the countryside,” says Foster, twiddling her napkin. “Compared to where Northern Ireland was in the Seventies and Eighties, it is such a joy to live in it now.”In 2011, a policeman called Ronan Kerr was murdered by dissident republicans. Foster’s middle child was aged 12. “He said: ‘Why would someone kill a policeman, mummy? I don’t understand.’ And I just thought, wow! When I was growing up, policemen were being killed, innocent people were being killed all the time.”Half of young voters identify as neither nationalist nor unionist. For politicians such as Foster, whose childhoods were marked by the Troubles, compromise has always been tinged with fear. “Reconciliation has happened, maybe not at the political level, but at the grassroots,” she says.A new generation has a task ahead. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"families across state say they struggle to access early disability services","story":" Aisling Higgins with her two-year-old daughter, Tilly, at their home in Caltra, Co Galway. Photograph: Joe O ShaughnessyChildren across the State are struggling to access early intervention disability services, according to concerned families who feel their children have been “left behind” by the HSE.Early intervention is a systematic programme of therapy, exercises and activities for children with disabilities.During the first wave of Covid-19, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists who worked for the HSE’s local early intervention teams were redeployed.Families say this has left the services in disarray, with many struggling to get vital therapies for their children.Barry Sheridan, CEO of Down Syndrome Ireland, says the organisation is hearing from hundreds of parents whose children are receiving “little or no” early intervention therapies.However, he says the problem pre-dates the Covid pandemic.“Before the pandemic, we surveyed families to find out how many speech and language therapy sessions they were offered in 2019. The average was five sessions in a whole year.”Mr Sheridan added the situation has significantly worsened over the past year due to redeployment.“Most of the evidence-based interventions need four to five sessions per week. Even once a week would be a huge improvement.”Tilly Higgins, from Caltra in Galway, is two-years-old. She has never received any physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, or occupational therapy from the HSE early intervention team.Her mother, Aisling, says Tilly did receive support from an early intervention nurse. “She was amazing. But then Covid hit and there was nothing. Just silence.”RedeployedDuring the first lockdown, the HSE sent a letter to the family, saying the early intervention therapists were redeployed. “It said we would be contacted in due course.”At this stage, Tilly’s parents were trying to help her crawl and stand up, but she had yet to receive any physiotherapy.They asked other parents for advice and Googled resources, but Ms Higgins says while they tried their best, they are not qualified professionals.Ms Higgins then connected Down Syndrome Ireland (DSI), who put her in touch with their early years specialist. “Only for her, I would have crawled into a corner at times, it’s so lonely and isolating when the supports aren’t there.”Around Christmas, Tilly began to get frustrated and angry. Ms Higgins believes this was because she couldn’t express herself. “The DSI Galway branch organised a family Lámh sign course, we paid for that ourselves.”This enabled Tilly to communicate with the rest of her family. “She can let us know when she’s hungry, when she wants play or to have a bath, she’s back to her happy self.”By the time Tilly turned two, Ms Higgins just “broke down”. “I was worried for her future. She’s two, she never had any physio, speech and language, occupational therapy.“How will she be able to keep up with her peers, and to make friends?”Ms Higgins contacted the HSE Early Intervention Team to raise her concerns. Over a month ago, she got an email saying a request for speech and language therapy had been made.Recently, Tilly’s early intervention nurse visited her, and she said she would try to organise a physio and speech and language assessment.‘Will it ever happen?’However, Tilly has received no appointment date yet.“It’s like chasing a pot of gold and the end of the rainbow . . . will it ever happen? Even if we get an appointment, is it just one appointment and then nothing?” she asks.She believes with the right support, Tilly can really thrive. “She can soak anything up, she’s so bright.”In a statement, the HSE said that while children’s disability services were initially stepped down in March 2020, services continued for children with high prioritised needs, with infection prevention controls in place.“Furthermore, children’s disability services have continued to provide services despite the challenges encountered since the HSE cyber-attack on May 14th.”The HSE added that it was “fully cognisant” of the stress caused to families due to waiting times.It added that service improvements are being rolled out. “Children’s Disability Network Teams are being established to provide services and supports for all children with complex needs within a defined geographic area.”These teams will include occupational therapists, psychologists, nurses, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, social workers and others.“Once all teams are in place, every child with complex needs will have access to a team, regardless of the nature of their disability, where they live, or the school they attend.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"public consultation opens on proposed royal canal greenway in dublin","story":"The urban greenway project is being developed by the council, along with the National Transport Authority, and Waterways Ireland.

Video: RTEThe Government’s advice will change from asking people to avoid non-essential travel to advising them to travel safely and in line with public health guidelines. File photograph: iStockInternational travel will resume from July 19th at which point the Government’s advice will change from asking people to avoid non-essential travel to advising them to travel safely and in line with public health guidelines.A new concept of an “emergency brake” will be applied for countries outside the European Union where there are potentially dangerous variants of concern in circulation. While the rules appear complicated at first glance, they are split between EU travel and non-EU travel.For those travelling within the EU, the rules will depend on whether they have a new Digital Covid Cert or not.And for inbound travellers coming from outside the EU the rules will depend on whether such an emergency brake has been applied to the relevant country or not.The Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has also lifted the requirement for mandatory hotel quarantine for those arriving from Belgium, France, Luxembourg, and the United States of America, with effect from Friday.Travel originating within the EUA Digital Covid Cert will be given to a person if they have recovered from Covid-19, been vaccinated or received a negative test result.For passengers with a digital cert who are coming into Ireland from the EU, they will not have to get tested or quarantine upon arrival and can travel freely.The caveat to this is the following: if a person has a digital cert but they were given it on the basis of a negative antigen test rather than PCR test, they will have to get that PCR test not more than 72 hours before arrival into Ireland.For passengers who do not have a digital cert, they will also have to present proof of a negative PCR test taken not more than 72 hours before arrival but will not have to quarantine.Travel from countries outside the EU like the USThen there are separate rules for those who travel from outside the EU from so-called third countries.There are two scenarios here.The first is for countries where no “emergency brake” is applied. An emergency brake allows Ireland “to adopt urgent and time-limited measures to react to the emergence of a variant” and effectively put a country on a red list.For those who are vaccinated and coming from a country without such an emergency brake, they do not need a test or to quarantine.For those who are not vaccinated and are coming from a country without an emergency brake, they will need to show evidence of a PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before arrival and they will have to self-quarantine, which could come to an end if they get a negative PCR test taken no earlier than five days after arrival.Travelling from outside the EU from countries with an “emergency brake”Then there is the question of what happens for those travelling from countries outside the EU where an emergency brake has been applied.Even if the passenger has been vaccinated, they will have to show evidence of a PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before arrival and will have to self-quarantine, which could end if they get a negative PCR test no earlier than five days after arrival.The rules are more strict again for those who are unvaccinated and are arriving from a country with an emergency brake attached.In this instance they will need to go into mandatory hotel quarantine for 14 days, which could end after day 10 if they get a negative test.The rules effectively mean that any person who is vaccinated and travelling from either the EU or a third country will not need to quarantine or get tested as long their country is not the subject of an emergency brake.It is bit more complicated for those who do not have a Covid cert or are not vaccinated and this is especially so for unvaccinated people coming from countries where the emergency brake applies.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"scientists in vietnam discover new hybrid coronavirus variant","story":"Residents wearing face  practise social distancing as they wait to be tested at a makeshift Covid-19 rapid testing centre near the Bach Mai hospital in Hanoi in March 2020. File photograph: Manan VatsyayanaAFP via GettyScientists in Vietnam have discovered a new coronavirus variant that is a hybrid of strains first found in India and the UK, the country’s health minister has said.Nguyen Thanh Long said scientists examined the genetic make-up of the virus that had infected some recent patients, and found the new version of the virus.He said lab tests suggested it might spread more easily than other versions of the virus.Viruses often develop small genetic changes as they reproduce, and new variants of the coronavirus have been seen almost since it was first detected in China in late 2019.The World Health Organisation has listed four global “variants of concern” – the two first found in the UK and India, plus ones identified in South Africa and Brazil. Mr Long said the new variant could be responsible for a recent surge in Vietnam, which has spread to 30 of the country’s 63 municipalities and provinces.Vietnam was initially a standout success in battling the virus – in early May, it had recorded just over 3,100 confirmed cases and 35 deaths since the start of the pandemic.But in the last few weeks, Vietnam has confirmed more than 3,500 new cases and 12 deaths, increasing the country’s total death toll to 47.Most of the new transmissions were found in Bac Ninh and Bac Giang, two provinces dense with industrial zones where hundreds of thousands of people work for major companies including Samsung, Canon and Luxshare, a partner in assembling Apple products.Church clusterDespite strict health regulations, a company in Bac Giang discovered that one fifth of its 4,800 workers had tested positive for the virus.In Ho Chi Minh City, the country’s largest metropolis with a population of nine million, at least 85 people have tested positive as part of a cluster at a Protestant church, the health ministry said.Worshippers sang and chanted while sitting close together without wearing proper masks or taking other precautions.Vietnam has since ordered a nationwide ban on all religious events.In major cities, authorities have banned large gatherings, closed public parks and non-essential business including in-person restaurants, bars, clubs and spas.Vietnam so far has vaccinated one million people with AstraZeneca jabs.Last week, the government sealed a deal with Pfizer for 30 million doses, which are scheduled to be delivered in the third and fourth quarters of this year.It is also in talks with Moderna which would give it enough jabs to fully vaccine 80 per cent of its 96 million people. – APEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"what is the eu digital covid certificate","story":"While the digital Covid certificate  system  is set for formal launch on July 1st, Greece has announced  it is ready to use the system earlier as it is keen to start its summer tourism season. Photograph: Getty ImagesWhat is the EU digital Covid certificate?The digital Covid certificate is aimed to help EU residents demonstrate whether they have been vaccinated when travelling within the bloc. The system has been developed at the insistence of member states that are economically reliant on tourism in the hope it will help to ease travel restrictions.How will the system work?The free certificate will be a scannable QR code that travellers can show on a piece of paper or on their phones, similar to the airport boarding passes familiar from pre-pandemic times.It is designed to include people who have not been vaccinated as well: it can also show if you have tested negative for Covid-19 or if you have had the illness and recovered.The certificate is not mandatory for travellers. It remains up to each member state to set their own Covid-19 health policies, and therefore to choose whether to treat vaccinated people that arrive in their country differently to non-vaccinated people.Some countries will choose to exempt vaccinated people from requirements such as to undergo a Covid-19 test or quarantine, particularly if they want to attract tourists. Some EU countries have begun to already exempt vaccinated arrivals from restrictions, including Croatia, Greece, and from June 7th, Spain. People are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their final dose.When will it go live?The system is currently being trialled, and is set for formal launch on July 1st, though countries can choose to link in later. Greece has announced that it is ready to use the system earlier as it is keen to start its summer tourism season. Ireland is to join on July 19th.In order to link up to the system national healthcare systems must collect vaccination data in a standard format so that they can issue the certificates for their residents.The data that the certificates must contain includes name, date of birth, date of issuance, date of vaccine received, test or recovery from Covid-19, and a unique identifier.The information is not stored in a central EU database, but remains kept in each country’s national healthcare system. The digital architecture the EU has built essentially provides a way for this data to be presented in a code that can be read and understood in any of the 27 countries when travellers arrive.The vaccines approved by the European Medicines Agency (AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson \u0026amp Johnson) are automatically accepted. Member states can choose to also accept vaccines that are not approved by the European Medicines Agency. Some of these have been used within the EU, such as Russia’s Sputnik and China’s Sinopharm in Hungary. What about travel beyond the EU?The European Commission says it is “working with the World Health Organisation to ensure that certificates issued in the EU can be recognised elsewhere in the world as well”.What about Northern Ireland?The State’s HSE has the responsibility of issuing Covid-19 digital vaccination certificates for residents of the Republic. Eligibility for vaccination throughout the EU is generally linked to where you have a social insurance or healthcare number, in Ireland’s case a PPS number.The European Commission has said that countries outside the EU could choose to join the system but this appears to be unlikely in the case of the UK. That means it will be up to each member state to set policy on how to treat travellers who have been vaccinated through the UK National Health Service.NHS England has a Covid app that can be used as a certificate: cabinet minister Michael Gove announced this week that the countries that have agreed to accept as proof of vaccination now include Barbados, Croatia, Greece, Turkey, Gibraltar, Iceland, Moldova, Bulgaria, and Estonia. Northern Ireland’s Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride told journalists this week that work on a version for residents in the North was “developing very quickly” and would initially be a paper system before moving to a digital format. “We hope to be in a position to announce that some time in July,” he told The News Letter.

Last week it was reported that the pair had sent “save-the-date” cards to family and friends to “celebrate their wedding” on July 30, 2022.Most of us presumed that meant the marriage would be around that date, too – but why not something smaller, sooner, in keeping with Covid rules? After all, they’d been engaged since 2019.When the big day came, it was intimate, brief, delightful, well-choreographed: in and out of Westminster Cathedral before tourists realised what was going on.Boris is the first PM to get married in office since Lord Liverpool in 1822 – and in a Catholic church, no less.For this to happen, it’s speculated, his previous marriages were annulled or Boris invoked his Catholic baptism to assert that they were invalid – because they weren’t conducted with the Church’s permission.Either way, the key thing is that Britain has a baptised Catholic as prime minister.Tony Blair attended Mass while in office but only announced a conversion after he left.What is striking is how little fuss has been made about Boris’s religion at all: our sectarian ides, at least in England, seem buried, and it’s taken one of the most definitively English prime ministers to do it.It’s a big shift, too, for court politics: Johnson is clearly in love and now Symonds is his wife.Dominic Cummings had made a point of referring to her as a girlfriend, deliberately reinforcing the idea that she has more influence than is constitutionally appropriate.Symonds’s friends always said the attacks on her were motivated by sexism – either way, she’s his wife now, and all of that sort of sniping has been shut down in one fell swoop.She probably does enjoy influence over some issues, particularly the environment, but, again, her supporters point to her own career in machine politics as evidence that whatever she pushes for is well-informed and shaped by experience, and in any case prime ministerial spouses have naturally always had an input.The wedding sends a message that the PM is getting on with things, including his private life, and that he is bringing some internal order after the Covid-induced chaos of the past 18 months.It’s been an incredible journey: starting with getting Brexit done, which the critics said was impossible, only to hit the Covid wall.But he recovered and, thanks to the vaccine, so did the UK. The Cummings testimony might have dented the Johnson administration’s reputation among some voters, but following a string of successes in English elections, it is generally riding high.In front of the Tories is a judgment call on sticking to the June 21 deadline for opening-up, followed by the question of the best way to regrow the economy. Boris’s fans hope we see a return of Boris the libertarian.But for now, what matters is the PM has married, he is happy, the wedding was a great, joyous success.He and his wife have a wonderful young son, Wilfred. They also have a dog to look after.

It is expected to reopen in the summer of 2023.The new owners of Stoke Park, Reliance Industries Limited, are making a major investment into the estate and are committed to preserving Stoke Park\u0027s rich heritage, a club spokesman said, explaining how the club\u0027s fifth owner had a responsibility to future proof the business.The closure will also temporarily scupper the Boodles Challenge, an  international five-day tennis exhibition which is held in the week before Wimbledon and has seen players such as Tim Henman and Novak Djokovic compete.The club\u0027s 160 staff will be scaled down, with those leaving being properly compensated for their dedicated service the spokesman added.Sean Connery was filmed on the course in 1964, playing golf as 007 against Auric Goldfinger with his henchman Oddjob, who later decapitates a statue with his chakram-loaded bowler hat.Hugh Grant, Colin Firth and Renee Zellweger were filmed in the grounds and The Pennsylvania Suite for the 2001 film Bridget Jones\u0027s Diary, and the park has also featured in The Crown.Members, who pay more than £4,000 a year in membership fees, expressed disgust that the club is closing so soon after reopening. They fear the clubhouse could become Mr Ambani’s private residence.Des Folliard, a former club golf captain who has played there for 23 years, said: It\u0027s all up in the air. There\u0027s talk of it being made into a private residence. A lot of the golf clubs in the UK are being bought over by very rich people from abroad – it\u0027s strange.Phil Slater, 45, from Ealing, in London, added: A lot of rich people just want their personal plaything. He\u0027ll probably come over here for a couple of months a year and have the golf course to himself.John Lee, 46, a banker from Farnham Common, has had a family membership at the club along with his wife and son for the last five years.Closing it for two years is going to lose them members. Some won’t come back because we now have to look for other clubs. There\u0027s probably four or five others near where we live, where you can take the family and have fun, he said.Sue Gaskell, 74, from Marylebone, London, has been a member for 21 years and is a former lady captain of the club.The letter we received kept saying \u0027we\u0027re delighted, we\u0027re delighted\u0027 – well, you\u0027re shutting the place down! Several people were in tears. There\u0027s one girl who lives round the corner who bought the property specifically to play golf here, she said. There\u0027s rumours going around they\u0027ll have an exclusion zone around the mansion so plebs like me can\u0027t go in.Asked to clarify whether Mr Ambani intended to create a private residence, the spokesman said the new owners have been clear they will restore the club to its former glory, adding that its members remained the beating heart of Stoke Park and they look forward to welcoming them back to share a glorious future.He refused to be drawn on whether membership fees would increase.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"have finally passed peak woke","story":"The BBC, which became almost paralysed with adoration for the Black Lives Matter organisation and sought to take a lead role in brainwashing the nation into believing we are all guilty, learned its lesson about overdoing the woke when hit by a tsunami of rage after attempting to “decolonise” the Last Night of the Proms. The perception of woke obsessions in broadcast news – not least since the Murdoch organisation surrendered control of Sky News – has directly led to the creation of a new channel, GB News, due to launch next month. Aware of the enormous popularity of television channels that show unwoke programmes and films from the last half of the 20th century, the recently-installed BBC director-general, Tim Davie, has reminded his senior staff that the Corporation must serve everyone.Yet nothing has done more to make people to rise up against this totalitarian attempt at social brainwashing than the incessant posturing and bleating of the Crown Prince and Princess of Woke, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Their titanic self-regard, vacuous and self-pitying pronouncements, and consequent rudeness to the most admired person in Britain, Her Majesty the Queen, have bred ridicule and contempt.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lecturers avoid eye contact could reported 1 4 top universities","story":"Students could report their lecturers for “microaggressions” at one in four of Britain’s Russell Group universities, The  can disclose, with avoiding eye contact a potential offence on one campus.Six universities in the group of 24 institutions cite microaggressions on their “Report + Support” and inclusivity webpages, where students and staff can report discriminatory behaviour.On Durham University’s website, examples of such transgressions are “not giving someone eye contact” and “constantly criticising and never praising”. Below the list is a button to anonymously report students, staff members or visitors to campus authorities.It comes after Cambridge University this week took down a similar microaggressions webpage where dons could be flagged for raising an eyebrow.Prof Stephen Toope, the vice-chancellor, said its publication was a “mistake” after 25 academics openly revolted. A fierce backlash saw threats of legal action.But The Sunday  can reveal that microaggressions are still mentioned as able to be reported by scholars and students at Durham, St Andrews, Oxford University’s Lady Margaret Hall, Manchester, Newcastle and Birmingham.At St Andrews, its “Report + Support” site allows direct anonymous reporting of microaggressions heard on campus. Examples listed include backhanded compliments, “avoiding or turning one’s back on certain people” and asking a black person if that is their “natural” hair.The webpage notes: “Microaggressions are brief, everyday interactions that send denigrating messages to people, which are subtle and insidious, often leaving the victim confused, distressed and frustrated and the perpetrator oblivious of the offense they have caused. Microaggressions can be intentional or unintentional.”It adds: “Intent is not the same as impact, and a throw-away comment or joke can have a huge impact on another person. It is everyone’s responsibility to think about the impact that their words might have on someone else.”Other microaggressions on Durham’s reporting site include “not providing timely and constructive feedback” and “not acknowledging someone’s contribution”.Both St Andrews and Durham say on their sites that while microaggressions are not illegal, they may amount to harassment under the Equality Act 2010 if they severely impact the victim or they are repeated.  Meanwhile, Oxford college Lady Margaret Hall has an inclusivity webpage that says a member of staff “is able to be contacted to report any racial macromicro-aggressions”.“She is able to provide advice on how to escalate this further (for example, mediation with the other party or through the harassment policy, if this is appropriate),” it adds.The University of Manchester’s Report and Support site allows direct anonymous reporting of microaggressions - including on behalf of a friend - alongside other offences such as hate crime, bullying, domestic abuse, sexual assault and stalking.The disclosure follows Cambridge’s version of the “Report + Support” site for “inappropriate” behaviour sparking a major free speech row over its listing of microaggressions.In an abrupt about-turn on Thursday, Cambridge re-published the site but the list of microaggressions and the anonymous reporting tool had been removed, after 25 dons wrote to The  demanding “unfettered freedom of speech”.All the universities were contacted for comment. Manchester declined to comment.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"not rural hay wain could based north london cart","story":"For years, it has been celebrated as one of the best portrayals of rural England ever painted.Voted Britain\u0027s second greatest masterpiece in this, its bicentennial year, John Constable\u0027s The Hay Wain has forever been associated with the painter\u0027s favourite haunt on the River Stour in Suffolk.Yet a new investigation into the 1821 oil on canvas has made a remarkable discovery. Rather than depicting a hay wain, new evidence has emerged suggesting the picture may actually be based on a wood cart parked in north London. Although the background of Flatford Mill and Willy Lott\u0027s cottage may be familiar to art lovers, the details of the painting\u0027s creation seem to point to another source of inspiration – Whitestone Pond, in Hampstead.Now little more than a glorified traffic island, it was originally known as Horse Pond, a popular stopping place to allow horses to drink and cool off while giving farmers a chance to wash the mud from their cartwheels before driving into the city. While researching the quirkier corners of Hampstead history for his book Under Ken Wood, the writer Neil Titley discovered that the picture does not depict a hay wain at all but one of the wood carts that would have used the equine equivalent of a motorway service station. From 1819 to 1821, Constable lived at No 2, Lower Terrace, Hampstead, roughly 200 metres from Whitestone Pond. During this time he created dozens of paintings and drawings of the landscapes, sandpits and ponds that surrounded him.With only five months to complete the 6ft by 4ft canvas in time for the Summer Exhibition at the Royal Academy 200 years ago, he started panicking that he would not be able to return to Flatford Mill to refresh his inspiration.As he wrote on April 1: My picture goes to the Academy on the loth. I have yet much to do to it. While able to artificially construct the painting from previous sketches such as his circa 1810 oil of Willy Lott\u0027s cottage and his close study of cloud formations, he had no images of the main subject itself.Titley claims Constable then wrote to his Suffolk pupil John Dunthorne requesting a sketch of a hay wain – built with high sides to increase its load – yet the cart in the painting looks nothing like that.He said: It is far more likely that Constable relied on a real-life model much closer to hand. Each time he left his house, he would have seen stationary horses and carts standing up to their axles in the water at Whitestone Pond. Every type of wagon was present within a two-minute walk of his home and his easel. It may be significant that his own title was a more ambiguous Landscape: Noon – the popular name of The Hay Wain was only attached later by others.Constable completed the painting at his studio at Lower Terrace before sending it on to an initially indifferent reception at the Academy.Simon Wilson, the art historian and a former curator of Tate Britain, said Mr Titley\u0027s theory is entirely plausible and a fascinating contribution to Constable studies.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"social democratic government not tory one","story":"Never judge a politician by the labels they choose for themselves. Modern Prime Ministers always coin a term to encapsulate their grand narrative. For Tony Blair it was ‘the stakeholder society’, David Cameron ‘the Big Society’. Despite countless column inches devoted to it, their exact definition has remained elusive.Occasionally a party will stumble on a jingle that is both intuitive and straightforward. Boris Johnson’s ‘Get Brexit Done’ slogan helped the Tories secure an 80-seat majority. But now Brexit has been done, we have a nominally ‘Conservative’ party, whose grand idea is something called ‘levelling up’. Both labels deserve considerable scepticism.The Johnson administration cannot reasonably be described as ‘conservative’, if we take this to mean favouring free markets, striving for lower taxes, taking a prudential approach to public finances and displaying scepticism about the role of the state.The total tax take as a proportion of national income is at a 70-year high. There is every chance that this government will squeeze out more tax from the private sector than even Clement Attlee’s post-war socialist government. The pandemic has put further pressure on the state’s deteriorating balance sheet and it is near-impossible to find any serious area of spending that the government seems minded to cut – or even freeze. A microscopically modest trim of the foreign aid budget is the best they have come up with.The much trumpeted ‘levelling up’ agenda is simply a return to old-fashioned regional development policy. The man in Whitehall knows best and will direct central funding to areas which fit the right criteria on a civil service spreadsheet. This means billions spent on funds to regenerate high streets, improve bus routes or earmarked for infrastructure in electorally vital Red Wall seats. It is not that such efforts will have no positive impact – but there is virtually no plan to liberalise the supply side of the economy. How will this government make it more attractive to set up a business in the North East of England? Which taxes and regulations do they intend to sweep away? The silence is deafening.The current government only really fits within the Conservative tradition of the 1950s or 1960s, back when vast swathes of the economy were directed by Whitehall and elections merely decided which managers would be in control. We may have returned to a social democratic consensus, where state intervention is the automatic response to any human ill. Too many obese people in Britain? Ok, let’s make it illegal for marmite and mustard to be advertised online then.The best way of understanding this government’s overarching vision is to grasp the philosophy of the departed Mr Cummings. His analysis is less about the state’s role than the bureaucrats’ level of expertise. If only we had better data scientists and strategic managers in Whitefall, central planning would suddenly produce perfect results. But this doesn’t even amount to rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic. It’s merely fretting about who sits in those deckchairs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"swiss far wise nation succumb stultifying embrace brussels","story":"Switzerland has pretty much everything going for it: low taxes, high wages, minimal unemployment, dispersed government, national sovereignty, direct democracy. According to the UN Human Development Index, which measures healthcare, education, life expectancy and the like, it is the third-best country to live in the world.Its population, pre-coronavirus, would swell by around 300,000 during office hours, as people from neighbouring states crossed the border to work – and small wonder. Switzerland’s GDP per head is roughly twice the EU’s.This last point is critical in understanding why talks between Brussels and Bern broke down last week. Switzerland’s wealth has always annoyed Euro-federalists. If a country of eight-and-a-half million people can flourish so insolently, what is left of their argument that you need to be part of a big bloc in order to survive?Eurocrats rationalise Switzerland’s success by telling themselves that that country prospers through parasitism. The Swiss, they claim, get all the benefits of the EU with few of the costs. They are able to trade freely with a vast market while doing such dastardly things as cutting their taxes. I once sat through a debate in the European Parliament in which Switzerland’s low tax rates were solemnly condemned by speaker after speaker as a form of illegal state aid.The EU had been pushing since 2014 to bring the Swiss into line with other neighbouring states, collapsing around 120 different sectoral treaties into a single Framework Agreement.The Swiss had no problem with streamlining these accords, but it soon became clear that Eurocrats were not interested only in a tidying-up exercise. They wanted to pull the Helvetic Confederation more firmly into their regulatory orbit, imposing stricter rules on state aid, social security and free movement.Swiss voters felt they were being bullied. In particular, they resented being told to accept EU rules on common citizenship – including welfare claims and voting rights – when they had voted against becoming EU citizens.“It was exactly what they tried to do to you during the Brexit talks”, a Swiss MP friend and occasional skiing companion tells me. “They basically wanted us to be non-voting members, following all their rules without a say. Boris said no to them and so have we”.Did Brexit, as many Swiss believe, make the Brussels negotiators more brittle, more hypersensitive, more domineering? Perhaps a little. But, frankly, they were already displaying all these characteristics when their talks with Bern began in 2014.The EU doesn’t do give-and-take. Even when a modicum of flexibility would plainly serve its own interests, it finds it hard to move beyond issuing lordly demands.Had Brussels allowed David Cameron to retrieve just one area of jurisdiction in the 2016 talks, Britain would surely have voted to stay. Had it treated Theresa May with less obvious disdain, Britain might have ended up inside the customs union. If it were ready to compromise over the Northern Ireland Protocol, Britain would not be heading for a unilateral renunciation. But, each and every time, the EU defaults to its tetchy imperiousness.In the short term, the collapse of these talks makes little difference. Switzerland is perfectly content with the existing tangle of bilateral accords. It was Brussels that had been pushing for change.But few expect the EU to let things lie. Just as it did during the Brexit talks, it will seek to tighten the screw, excluding Switzerland from common deals on pharmaceuticals, research, financial services and more. The fact that it cannot do these things without damaging its own economy is of no concern. For Brussels functionaries, European unity is an end in itself, not a means to a better life.But the Swiss are no more likely than the British to give in to threats. If their current half-in- half-out deal status is no longer on offer, they will almost certainly move further out. And they will be right, for the best way to safeguard their prosperity is to retain the unusual political structures on which it rests.Eurocrats like to imagine that the Swiss rejected EU membership for reasons of selfishness or xenophobia. They could not be more wrong. Switzerland is an exceptionally open and multilingual society, a quarter of whose population is foreign.No, the reason the Swiss did not want to join the EU is that they could see that ever-closer union was incompatible with the principles that govern their confederation, namely the dispersal of power to the cantons and the regular use of referendums. Those precepts have served to make them the richest and freest people in Europe, and good luck to them.And if you’re one of those tiresome people who thinks it’s enormously witty, at this stage, to quote Harry Lime’s crack about cuckoo clocks from The Third Man, I can only respond that I’d take the cuckoo clocks – and the Red Cross, and Nestlé and Novartis and velcro and, yes, 500 years of brotherly love – over the self-serving European Commission any day.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"times pimms oclock drinkers prefer aldi version","story":"Time is up for Pimm’s o’clock this summer as drinkers prefer Aldi’s own-brand version, a Which? survey suggestsAldi beat both Pimms and Aperol in blind taste tests in which consumers rated the flavour, “mouthfeel”, appearance and aroma of each drink.Which? asked 101 tasters to compare Aldi\u0027s Summer Punch (£7.49 for 70cl), Tesco\u0027s Summer Cup (£8 for 70cl) and Pimm\u0027s No.1, almost double the price at £15 for 70cl.Aldi\u0027s Summer Punch was the highest-rated overall, scoring 72 per cent, followed by Tesco\u0027s version (69 per cent) and Pimm\u0027s (67 per cent).More people picked it as their preferred drink compared to Tesco and Pimm\u0027s, with 45 per cent saying it was their favourite of the three.In a separate taste test, Which? asked 100 people to rate Aperol, also £15 for 70cl, against two supermarket aperitifs from Aldi and Sainsbury’s.Tasters found that Aldi\u0027s Aperini (£6.99 for 70cl) had the best balance between sweetness and bitterness, with a “noticeable citrusy flavour that was not too overpowering”.The original Aperol still received an overall score of 72 per cent but Aldi achieved 74 per cent, while Sainsbury\u0027s Aperitivo (£8 for 70cl) was judged to be a let-down when it came to appearance with its peachy pale colour and achieved 69 per cent.Which?

That he thinks he can carry on asnothing has happened is testimony to the callousness of this Government.”  David Crabtree, who saw eight residents at his care homes die after being forced to take in infected hospital patients in West Yorkshire, said: “Matt Hancock’s job was to protect us and our residents, he failed and he should go.” From March  last year, as the first wave of the pandemic took hold, , frail hospital patients were sent to care homes without a test. Mr Hancock’s disastrous decision allowed the virus to seed in the deadliest of environments as the over- age group is the most vulnerable to Covid-  On April , in the first of a series of searing exposures, the Sunday People warned that care homes were a Covid time bomb and should be shielded. Ten days later the Department of Health suddenly changed tack and said patients being discharged into care homes should be tested. But by then it was too late.  The catastrophic failure helped contribute to more than , care home deaths linked to Covid in the first wave.The PM’s former top aide Mr Cummings accused Mr Hancock of “categorically” telling Boris Johnson in March that hospital patients would be tested before being discharged to care homes.But the policy was not put in place until the Prime Minister ed from his own Covid hospital battle in mid-April. Mr Johnson reportedly asked Mr Hancock: “What the hell happened ” over testing. Jo Goodman, co-founder of Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice, which represents , families who have lost loved ones, said: “The picture painted this week has been that the Government threw those in care homes to the wolves and then lied about it.  “There must be an immediate inquiry into Matt Hancock’s handling for the full truth to be uncovered.” Care boss Mr Crabtree added: “If there’s any truth that he lied to Boris Johnson about testing patients before they were sent to us, then he should be done.” Mr Hancock said his recollection of events was that he only promised to introduce testing when capacity increased. In response to Mr Cummings’s claims, he told MPs: “We followed the clinical advice on the appropriate way forward.” MP Munira Wilson, the Lib Dem health spokeswoman, said: “If Matt Hancock has been found to have lied to the House of Commons he will have to go.”  Victims of the no-test policy include Bernard Kirton, , a former mayor in Whitnash, Warks, who fell ill with Covid shortly after being sent from Warwick hospital to a care home on April  last year. He died five days later. During the first wave, Mr Hancock repeatedly claimed he threw a “protective ring” around care homes. Mr Kirton’s daughter Fiona, , said yesterday: “He’s a complete liar.”  Dennis Ely, , caught Covid after five hospital patients were discharged into his Ipswich care home without being tested. He died on Good Friday last year. His daughter Lisa, , said: “Matt Hancock needs to go – my dad’s death was preventable.” Tonight the Department for Health and Social Care said: “The Health and Social Care Secretary’s focus throughout this pandemic has been on saving lives. Guidance for the care sector was first published in February . At this time, the scientic understanding did not suggest asymptomatic iniduals posed a signicant risk in terms of transmission. “Those with symptoms would have been tested on admission or during a hospital stay and were isolated accordingly. Further guidance was issued on  March  setting out how we would continue to support the safe discharge of people who no longer needed to stay in hospital.” aposHANCOCK IS INCOMPETENT AND NEEDS TO GOapos  Amos Waldman, , called for Matt Hancock to go after losing his grandmother to Covid. Sheila Lamb, , whose son Nigelis Amos’s dad, died in a north London care home in April last year. Amos, a barrister from Heaton Chapel, Greater Manchester, said: “Every time Matt Hancock mentions the protective ring it’s like being punched in the gut – because it’s untrue. “The only ring around care homes was to protect us from seeing the horror of what was going on. This rewriting of history concerns me.”  The son of a woman who died of Covid in her care home  months ago said Matt Hancock must go. Shocked Alan Wightman added as he mourned his mother Helen: “He has repeatedly told untruths. “We knew there was never a protective ring around care homes and we know from SAGE minutes that scientists warned on asymptomatic transmission as early as January . ”Alan, , from Bedale, North Yorks, went on: “For Hancock to say he didn’t know is nonsense. “They did know. They just did nothing about it. Hancock is incompetent and should go.”FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnNHSCare homesPoliticsCoronavirusMatthew Hancock MP"},{"url":null,"title":"dominic cummings tv vengeance marathon","story":"NewsopinionDominic Cummings TV vengeance marathon was compelling - and horricDominic Cummings, the former special adviser to the Prime Minister, gave evidence to a select committee for  minutes.

There were explosive bits – we’ll get to those in a sec – but can we first acknowledge the size of it  Seven hours. Enough time to watch Dances with Wolves, make Jamie’s vegetable risotto, then watch Dances with Wolves again. Dominic Cummings, the former special adviser to the Prime Minister, gave evidence to a select committee for  minutes. That’s a long time. It was best treated like a test match, on in the background and run to the TV when something exciting happens. One reader did their ironing. Another bled the radiators. We found a way. What is it they say  “Months of ­inactivity punctuated by moments of extreme terror.” Mr Cummings is compelling TV with good reason. It’s very rare for anyone to give an accurate, contemporaneous picture of what happens at the heart of government. What is it they say  “Laws, like sausages, cease to inspire respect in proportion as we know how they are made.”Some of it was straight, stone-cold, amazing for the sheer horror of it. The care home scandal, the sheer lack of planning and foresight, the battling egos. The utter testosterone-fuelled incompetence. A glimpse into the inner-workings of something that really doesn’t work.  I can’t imagine anyone taking any comfort from it. Mr Cummings began ­apologetically but it quickly became clear he had a dferent agenda. This was about being as explosive as possible, settling old scores by casually lobbing grenades. Some pegged him as an unreliable narrator. It doesn’t really matter. This was testimony from a man who has been at the very centre of things and wanted to tell us all about it. At one point he answered a question by beginning: “I don’t have an opinion on that” – which we can peg as a definite lie. Mr Cummings has an opinion on everything. As he warmed up, he took on the manner of one of those blokes who corners you in the pub when you’re ­trying to read the paper.  The longer they go on the more random it gets: here we got multiple Bill Gates references, Spider-Man, Independence Day. Anthrax and shopping trollies and Jaws. But, like Mr Cummings, they really warm up when you get them on about their ex. In this case, the Prime Minister, those who work for him, his fiancée Carrie Symonds, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, the people who work for him. Even Dilyn the dog got a metaphorical kicking.

But a No source said more than two weeks later a screen in the Cabinet Room showed the consignment flashing red – meaning it had not arrived.Chancellor Rishi Sunak had to clear up the mess and No adviser Dominic Cummings “went into a rage” and was furious the PPE was coming by boat instead of chartered planes. More than  of , frontline health workers went on to die in the pandemic, many complaining of PPE shortages. The source told the Sunday Mirror: “Nearly everything Hancock said we would later discover was diametrically opposite to the truth. He said bringing in PPE from China had been cleared and it turned out it hadn’t.” A government spokesman said  billion PPE items had been delivered and added: “These claims are unsubstantiated and we reject them. The Government worked flat out to get the PPE needed for the frontline.  “The National Audit Office recognised all NHS providers they spoke to were able to get the equipment they needed in time.” Our informant reveals claims that Hancock presided over other blunders around care homes and those shielding at home. Labour ’s Richard Burgon said: “Matt Hancock should resign andhe doesn’t he should be sacked.” And writing in the Observer, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: “Twice as many people died in the second wave than in the first. That was avoidable and unforgivable.” In evidence to MPs, Cummings said Hancock should have been sacked and accused him of lying over saying patients were being tested before ing to care homes. The Health Secretary says he only recollects promising checks would be made “when we could do it”. The PM has backed Hancock. But the No insider accused the Health Secretary of consistently telling lies at the am Covid meetings. Of the China PPE debacle, the insider added: “Dom went into a rage. Rishi had to unlock this. He said the Dept of Health could have any money it needed to get PPE through.” The insider claims Hancock and NHS boss Sir Simon Stevens were in chaos. An emergency No unit under former Vote Leave head of research Oliver Lewis had to be set up to identy those most likely to die so they could receive food parcels while isolating.  But the NHS data it began with was so inadequate that numbers rocketed , from the initial , in  hours. The source revealed: “The whole system was absolutely appalling.” The government spokesperson rejected the claim, saying: “Our quick action on food parcels meant we were able to provide vital food and medicine to over . million vulnerable people.” He added that . million free boxes of food were delivered in the four months up to  July. Lewis was praised by Cummings. But the unsung heroes of the unit were Jenner Allum, who ran Whitehall’s gov.uk website, and Lewis’s PA Cara Phillips. A senior Whitehall figure said: “Cara impressed everyone with her hard work and total grip on the situation. Thousands are alive today because of her.” The trio worked for three days and nights to get the shielding system up and running. They used the gov.uk website, automated phone lines and a mailshot to reach the vulnerable. Care home providers blame a litany of Tory cuts for the inability to protect the sector in a crisis. On May  last year, even as the number of care home deaths rose towards an eventual ,, Hancock made his declaration that “right from the start we’ve tried to throw a protective ring around our care homes”.

Former-No adviser Dominic Cummings said Hancock should have been sacked for misinforming the public with many people dying at care homes in March and April last year who brought the virus back with them from hospitals.Cummings told MPs last Wednesday: We were told categorically in March that people would be tested before they went back to care homes. We only subsequently found out that that hadnapost happened. The government rhetoric was we put a shield around care homes - it was complete nonsense”. His comments have been followed by the Tories dropping six points in an opinion poll on Saturday. But Hancock still retains the backing of some members of the Tory party who do not agree with Cummings’ assessment that he lied to the prime minister.  One Tory MP said: “He wouldn’t dare go on telly to promise what he thought he couldn’t deliver. “Matt is the kind of guy who sh**s at his own shadow.” It comes as a Downing Street eyewitness has alleged that Hancock told the prime minister that protective clothing was on its way for thousands of NHS staff in March , when he knew it wasn’t. It is claimed by the Sunday Mirror source that he lied about a shipment of badly needed masks and gowns that were supposed to be coming from China saying it had been “sorted and there was no problem”.  The insider also claims Hancock and NHS boss Sir Simon Stevens were in chaos. An emergency No unit under former Vote Leave head of research Oliver Lewis had to be set up to identy those most likely to die so they could receive food parcels while isolating. But the NHS data it started out with was so inadequate that numbers rocketed , from the initial , in  hours. The source revealed: “The whole system was absolutely appalling.” A government spokesperson rejected the claim, saying: “Our quick action on food parcels meant we were able to provide vital food and medicine to over . million vulnerable people.” He added that . million free boxes of food were delivered in the four months up to  July.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnNHSConservative PartyCare homesNursing homesCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"unmarried couples treated like third","story":"NewsUnmarried couples treated like third class citizens risk losing pension payoutsOnly six in  members of private schemes can pass on pensions to a partner by right and millions more face uncertainty when a loved one dies thanks to complex rulesmirrorShareCommentsByNigel NelsonPolitical Editor:,  MAY NewsRay Usher and partner Linda Drummie\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

House of Commons library figures show only six in  members of private schemes can pass on pensions to a partner as of right, while eight in  must rely on the discretion of trustees. It means up to a million couples are living without any future financial guaranteesone of them dies. Now MPs are to investigate whether people living together should have the same pension rights as those who are married or in civil partnerships. The Commons Women and Equalities Committee is to take evidence from retired BT project manager Ray Usher, . He has spent a year trying to ensure his partner of  years, Linda Drummie, , is provided for in the event of his death. Ray has nominated the former GP’s receptionist for the half share of his occupational pension she would be entitled toshe was his widow. And although BT pension providers have not said no, they have not said yes either – and warn it could take years to sort out. They told Ray: “The experience of a surviving partner is very dferent to the experience of a surviving spouse.” Ray, of Whitton, South West London, said: “Everyone tells us we should have nothing to worry about but no one will put that in writing. It leaves too much uncertainty. We are being treated like third class citizens.” The couple own their home, have joint bank accounts and utility bills are in both names. If they were married, Linda would simply have to produce a death certicate. But as they are not she must fill out forms after Ray’s death proving financial dependency for pension trustees to consider. And what unmarried partners may get is governed by dferent rules in dferent pension schemes. Former pensions minister Steve Webb said: “I strongly suspect Ray would have his wishes respected. But I can see why they don’t like the element of discretion and uncertainty.”FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnHouse of CommonsSteve WebbPoliticsSunday Mirror"},{"url":null,"title":"bank holiday revellers inches away","story":":root Bank Holiday revellers get inches away from ft clf edge as they snap selfiesPeople were seen getting dangerously near to the edge of Birling Gap clf in East Sussex as revellers flocked to the coasts today to soak up warm weather after months of Covid restrictionsBank Holiday revellers get inches away from ft clf edge as they snap selfiesPeople were seen getting dangerously near to the edge of Birling Gap clf in East Sussex as revellers flocked to the coasts today to soak up warm weather after months of Covid restrictionsGroups got yards away from the clf edge while admiring the viewsImage: SCZByNina LloydFreelance reporter:,  May Bank Holiday sightseers were pictured on a clf edge standing nail-bitingly close to a ft drop as Brits hit the coast today to enjoy the latest easing of lockdown restrictions.

The craze sees young people placing the small beads on their tongue to create the impression that they have a tongue piercing - but the balls can easily be swallowed. Ingesting more than one magnet poses a risk of serious damage as the two pieces can attract each other inside the body and block intestines or bowels. At least  children in England have needed le-saving surgery after swallowing magnets over the past three years. Health officials have warned that there has been a spike in hospital admissions in older children as some have been taking part in the trend. It led the NHS to issue a patient safety warning earlier this month, and the service is now pushing for a full-on ban on some of the toys. The news comes after -year-old Ellis Tripp was left fighting for his le after he swallowed several magnets last week. His mum Amy Clarke, , made a heartfelt plea urging other parents to get rid of the toys, branding them deadly.She posted on Facebook : Iaposm in a nightmare.This TikTok craze could would have killed himleft any longer.

And Ellisaposs school found other pupils with the magnets in their possession during a search, suspected to be linked to the TikTok trend.

A -year-old girl is also understood to have had major surgery after trying out the social media craze.Her mum, Faye Elizabeth, said she had swallowed  of the tiny beads, according to the Liverpool Echo.Health officials have now stressed that the toys are dangerous and said their sale should be banned.

Shahrooz Ghassemian, , used forged court documents to fool them so he could get back in – once while the buyer was on holiday. A court heard he had a fixation with the £, rented flat he and mum Hamila had lived in for  years that was comparable to a stalker. Tonight as pictures emerged of one of Ghassemian’s evictions at the home, the new owner, who did not want to be named, said: “The last time police discovered him on the couch watching TV, drinking a can of coke from the fridge in my own home. I was quite uncomfortable It’s horrible. He’s an idiot.”  The drama began after Ghassemian and Hamila were evicted from the one-bedroom flat in Kensington, West London, in  after falling into arrears with the freeholder. The flat was sold in March  so debts could be recovered. The new owner first encountered Ghassemian when he was having renovations done before moving in. “He broke in and ended up living there for a couple of months until we could evict him,” said the owner. “The second time he broke in I had moved in but was on holiday with my girlfriend. He called me and said ‘you have  hours to get your stuff’. We were in shock. We rang friends to go over there, but they found the door locked. They called the police.”  After Ghassemian’s arrest, his High Court deceptions were discovered. At a hearing in October , Mr Justice Henry Carr had ruled £, from the sale of the flat was to be paid to the court so money owed to the freeholder and another creditor could be paid back. It emerged Ghassemian forged a court document stating the sum was to be paid in full to his mother who died in a care home in March last year. Ghassemian was blocked from receiving the payment by three dferent banks, but he ed to court several times with further fake papers. This week Ghassemian, of Westminster, was jailed for six years at Isleworth Crown Court on three counts of perverting the course of justice. Prosecutor Susannah Stevens said: “Mr Ghassemian fraudulently obtained High Court orders and schedules. “His conduct was sophisticated, using judges’ handwriting and judges’ signatures. He inflicted signicant harm on a number of people both psychologically and financially.”Judge Martin Edmunds told him: “You continue to hold the belief that you ought to be entitled to occupy the flat. Your beliefis of the order of an obsession comparable to the fixed ideation of a stalker.”The first-time buyer is said to be £, out of pocket in legal fees as a result of his years-long battle due to be heard in the civil courts.

An inquest heard mum-of-two Katie Corrigan, , had become dependent on the painkiller and bought the pills online without having to tell her GP. Katie’s heartbroken mother Christine Taylor, also a nurse, insisted: “Tougher regulation is long overdue. It is not just the ease with which you can obtain these drugs online. It’s the fact that you can do so without your own doctor even being aware.” Use of online pharmacies exploded during lockdown as patients struggled to get face-to-face GP appointments. Patients can get a prescription after a review with an online doctor. The industry is worth £million a year in Britain and there is no regulation of providers based outside the UK.  Mrs Taylor told the Sunday Mirror: “She had a chronic neck problem and was prescribed codeine by her GP. “But when the GP became aware Katie was dependent on codeine, the prescriptions stopped. Despite no longer having the prescription, Katie was able to access it so easily online. “We believe it should be mandatory for online pharmacies to inform GPs exactly what has been sent to patients. There should also be limits on the amount of drugs ordered at one time.”  Katie’s dad Fred added: “We want the regulation made so tight this can’t happen again. Katie was able to find loopholes – those need to go. “We miss her every day and we’d give anything to have her back. We don’t want anyone to go through what we have.” Katie, of Hayle, in Cornwall, died in August . Among her parents’ last memories are treasured pictures of her on her travels in  and . One loophole they want closing is the ability for online patients to tick a box to stop GPs being notied. Mrs Taylor went on: “You tell the doctor your symptoms – real or made up. I’m a nurse and I’d be very warya patient said, ‘I don’t want my GP informed’. “That would tell me something is wrong. Your GP should be involved or informed.” Coroner Andrew Cox wrote a Prevention of Future Deaths report to warn of the dangers of buying drugs online. In his alert, sent to the Care Quality Commission and Department of Health, the Cornwall coroner said not having to noty GPs left the system “open to abuse”. The CQC said it aimed to improve regulation of providers “putting lives at risk”. The Department of Health is “considering carefully” the coroner’s concerns, adding: “Patient safety is our priority.” Around , UK deaths a year are linked to powerful painkillers.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorMore OnDepartment of HealthPrescriptionsMedicineSunday Mirror"},{"url":null,"title":"it turns out im really","story":"AdvertorialIt turns out I’m really good at it - man turns health challenges into sport and TV successHow actor Ekow Otoo went from a teenager facing a debilitating condition to a lead role in The National Lottery’s stunning new TV admirrorShareByLaura Tait:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY AdvertorialThanks to CGI, Ekow is transported into the middle of a Viking invasion in The National Lottery adImagine being a ft in, -year-old man and finding two pizzas too heavy to carry, but not knowing why. That was what happened to Ekow Otoo – an actor, spoken-word poet and model. “My legs had been giving me problems for years I was suffering a relapse and felt too weak to cook, so I’d ordered a takeaway. I remember being pinned to the wall when I took the pizzas from the delivery guy – they were too heavy to walk with,” says Ghanian-born Londoner Ekow, now . Ekow, who now knows he has multiple sclerosis , started experiencing issues aged . “I tried to get out of my bed one morning and my legs wouldn’t follow. After a nap they were fine again, but next time I played basketball I couldn’t run – my knees would buckle and I couldn’t get any speed.” A GP put the issue down to Ekow shooting up six inches in just one year. “They just thought I’d grown too quickly and my muscles were catching up.” MS is an inflammatory disease in which the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are damaged. Slowly the disease affected Ekow to the point he had to give up sport entirely. “I couldn’t even walk two roads without resting on walls.” At university Ekow struggled to get information from his brain to the page. “I think they thought I was lazy,” he says. “I didn’t connect the problem with my legs, though.”  Help and advice In February , Ekow went to bed with a chest infection. “When I woke I felt funny, sat down and couldn’t stand up again. I ended up in hospital with a doctor standing over my bed, saying: ‘This is MS.’ I remember thinking, ‘Wow, there’s a name for it.’ “It was such a relief to have a definitive diagnosis. I knew it wasn’t all in my head.” When he was first given his wheelchair, Ekow was, “overcome with peace”: “I thought it was going to be a massive struggle, but I sat in the chair and pushed for the first time, and it was like all the stress melted away. “It turns out I’m really good at it. I can travel faster than I used to, without worrying I’ll fall over, look strange or have to stop.” Since his diagnosis, Ekow has relied heavily on The National Lottery-supported MS Society which proved a vital source of information and help when he needed it. He has also benefited from sports, including wheelchair racing – mentored by Paralympian Vanessa Wallace – and adapted rowing with another National Lottery-supported organisation, British Rowing.

I just loved it – I took part in a development programme with British Rowing for a year and, in , won a para-rowing gold in the British Championships.” Ekow has even excelled at acting, and was recently picked to play the lead role in a stunning new National Lottery TV advert, which sees him performing dramatic stunts in his wheelchair.  Thanks to some clever CGI, viewers watch as he is transported from a street corner into the middle of a Viking invasion, before tearing through a museum and then taking off above the city skyline.

Public Health England says that two people who had received both jabs died after contracting the iant. Last night  people had died after , known infections of the iant, suggesting that vaccines are proving effective. Just three per cent of infections were among people who had been fully vaccinated, officials said. But there are questions over whether the mutant strain - thought to be up to  per cent more transmissible than the Kent iant - could scupper Boris Johnsonaposs plans to unlock England on June . Earlier today the Mirror reported that Covid cases and hospitalisations had risen by nearly  per cent in the past week. On Thursday there were  patients in UK hospitals with the virus, with  admissions in the past week. This is an increase of . per cent, the Department of Health figures reveal. But this is a fraction of the number at the height of the second wave in January, when more than , people were being treated. The Department of Health this afternoon confirmed , new infections and seven more deaths - bringing the number of Covid fatalities to , since the start of the pandemic. Earlier this week the government said the Indian iant - thought to be up to  per cent more transmissible than the Kent mutation - could account for three quarters of infections now happening in the UK.Last night the Mirror reported that  per cent of Englandaposs towns and cities were now recording a rise in new cases.Bolton, Blackburn with Darwen and Rossendale have the highest infection rates in the country, Public Health England data shows. In the past seven days , people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK - a . per cent increase compared to the previous week.Yesterday the daily figure crossed , for the first time since March amid growing concerns about the iant. Caution is needed in determining whether Englandaposs coronavirus restrictions can be lted next month or the situation could turn bad very, very quickly, a professor whose argument against herd immunity helped trigger Englandaposs first lockdown has warned. Sir Tim Gowers, Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, toldthe downside of being a bit more cautious was a lot smaller than the downside of getting it wrong.  Asked about the next step in lockdown easing in England, due on June , Prof Gowers said he did not believe the plans were necessarily at risk, but urged caution.Because Boris Johnson has made a big thing about all the steps being irreversible, I think heaposs put himself in a position where once he takes a step, heaposll be extremely reluctant to reverse because that would be a big U-turn, an embarrassing climbdown, he said.So I thinkthataposs the way youaposre going to play things, then you should be very, very cautious about every step you take ... And maybe everything [will] be OK, maybe the number of people who are vaccinated will be just enough ... aposRapos will broadly speaking stay below one even with Indian iants. Butitaposs not OK, we know, because of mathematics, that things will get bad very, very quickly. Or at least, maybe it wonapost look that quick to start with, but itaposll grow exponentially. So itaposll pick up speed and become a big problem.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBoris JohnsonUniversity of CambridgeDepartment of HealthPoliticsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"miracle image jesus christ appears","story":"NewsMiracle image of Jesus Christ appears on IKEA gents toilet door in GlasgowTwitter users are convinced the image of Jesus Christ is on the mens toilet door at an IKEA store in Braehead in Glasgow - but one person believes it looks more like a dogs rear endmirrorShareCommentsByCraig WilliamsRyan MerrieldReporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsShoppers have taken to Twitter convinced theyve spotted the image of Jesus at IKEA in Braehead \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

While out looking for new side tables and birch-framed armchairs, punters at the furnishing store in Braehead came across something not in the product catalogue.The pattern on the wooden door appears to resemble a bearded man near the handle - sort of, reports Glasgow Live. And while some say it must be the son of God, others think it looks more like Gandalf - the wizard in Lord of Rings, played by Ian McKellen in the films. But many are less convinced it is any kind of ine intervention, with one describing the veneer as looking like a dogaposs rear end.Have you seen the image of Jesus in an everyday object  Let us know at webnews@mirrorOne chap who spotted the apparition earlier this week while on a trip to Ikea took to social media to quiz others on whether they too had ever noticed it. He tweeted: Emaposday  clocked Jesus on the back of the gents toilet door in Ikea, Glasgow  A pal wasnapost for it, replying to the post by saying, hilariously, that the veneer on the door looks like a dugs a**e rather than the Holy Son of God. A quick look on Twitter suggests he isnapost the only person to have been left startled while heading to spend a penny.Plenty of others sharing their experiences of sighting Jesus over the years ever since the store opened on the outskirts of the Scottish city in . Others have said it looks like like Gandalf out of the Lord Of The Rings movies, while one person has gone as far to suggest that it looks more like terror leader Osama Bin Laden.In similar news, mum Shaunagh Robert spotted the face of Jesus while she was preparing the Christmas dinner last December.The mum-of-two, from Waltham Abbey, Essex, said: I was taking out the sprouts, topping and tailing them, and putting a cross on the bottom. When I saw the face I remember thinking aposoh my god, it could be Jesusapos what with it being so close to Christmas. I didnapost have the heart to cook him so I left the sprout in a corner cupboard and he just sat up there for a little while.

After successfully containing the virus for most of last year, Vietnam is grappling with a rise in infections since late April that accounts for more than half of the total , registered cases. So far, there have been  deaths. Vietnam has uncovered a new Covid- iant combining characteristics of the two existing iants first found in India and the UK, Health Minister Nguyen Thanh Long said, describing it as a hybrid of the two known iants. That the new one is an Indian iant with mutations that originally belong to the UK iant is very dangerous, he told a government meeting, a recording reveals.Have you contracted the Indian iant  Let us know at webnews@mirrorThe Southeast Asian country had previously detected seven virus iants: B.., B.., DG, B... - known as the UK iant, B.., A.. and B... - the Indian iant. Long said Vietnam would soon publish genome data of the newly identied iant, which he said was more transmissible than the previously known types. The World Health Organizationhas identied four iants of SARS-CoV- of global concern. These include iants that emerged first in India, Britain, South Africa and Brazil.  Officials at the WHO did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the iant identied in Vietnam. Long said laboratory cultures of the new iant showed the virus replicated itself very quickly, possibly explaining why so many new cases had appeared in dferent parts of the country in a short period of time. The Health Ministry told the meeting the government was working to secure  million vaccine doses under the COVAX cost-sharing scheme, as well as a further  million doses of Pfizerapossvaccine and  million of Russiaaposs Sputnik V.

The wettest locations, receiving more than twice the average rainfall, were southwest and northeast England, as well as Wales and parts of eastern Scotland. Parts of Scotland and northern England even saw snow at the beginning of the month when temperatures of -.C were recorded. Met Office forecaster Matthew Box said: Itaposs obviously a welcome change I think for many.Given that we have had a reasonably cold and then a wet couple of months through spring, with April being cold and May being wet and cloudy and generally on the cool side too, weaposve got a sunny end to May.

Ben Aldous, from the RAC, said: Our research points to Saturday and Monday being the busiest days, but in reality thereaposs a good chance the weather will have the final say as to how busy the roads get. Ato more typical late May temperatures and an end to the recent wind and rain could spark a sudden surge in journeys and mean some routes - especially those to the coasts and hills - start to clog up.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMet Office"},{"url":null,"title":"tributes lovely young boy 17","story":"NewsBody of lovely young boy pulled from canal with death of teenager not suspiciousScott Dorrington, , was found in the water in Clydebank, Scotland, on Friday morning.mirrorShareByEd McConnell:,  MAY NewsScott Dorrington,  \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The , deaths are testament to the appalling consequences. The PM’s surprise wedding may capture the headlines but it should not deflect from the agony too many families who have lost loved ones are going through. Mr Johnson has already kicked the inevitable reckoning into the long grass by refusing to hold a public inquiry into Covid until next year.  That inquiry should have been held last summer so lessons could be learned. But as we come out of lockdown there is no excuse for further delay. Today we publish evidence to show that Matt Hancock is not fit to hold the post of Health Secretary – supplied by someone who claims to have witnessed what was going on. Mr Cummings has promised to produce documentary evidence to MPs to back up those accusations. Should that prove what he and others claim, then Mr Hancock’s position will become untenable. But Mr Hancock can still show he has at least an ounce of honour by offering Mr Johnson his resignation now. And it would give some small comfort to all in mourning for those they have lost for the PM to accept it.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBoris JohnsonCare homesNursing homesSunday MirrorDominic CummingsMatthew Hancock MP"},{"url":null,"title":"what wedding rules england after","story":"NewsWhat are the wedding rules in England after Boris Johnson got married in secret Prime Minister Boris Johnson reportedly married fiance Carrie Symonds in a secret ceremony at Westminster Cathedral today, with  people now allowed at indoor and outdoor ceremonies in EnglandmirrorShareCommentsByTom PilgrimRyan MerrieldReporter:,  MAY NewsBoris Johnson and his fiancée Carrie Symonds reportedly married in secret \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

and hundreds of litres of paint, Stonehaven#s open air swimming pool has finally reopened for the first time in two years.With the sun out in full force and the water which was as warm and clear as the Mediterranean, swimmers were invited to make a splash.And, thanks to thousands of hours of volunteering and fundraising from the Friends of Stonehaven Open Air pool group, they also had the chance to speed test the newly installed £, chute.Prior to closing its doors due to the pandemic back in , the tourist attraction had welcomed more than , people a year who wanted to enjoy a dip.While the same numbers are unobtainable at the minute as a result to current coronavirus restrictions, groups behind the renovation are excited to get people back into the pool.In line with current Scottish Government restrictions, the pool has space for around  people at any given time and those wanting to attend will have to book a slot online.Working in partnership with Aberdeenshire Le and Aberdeenshire Council, the Friends group have had to overcome harsh weather and the pandemic to make this reopening possible.Gathering round the entrance of the site, chairman of the group Pete Hill thanked each of the members in attendance before Aberdeenshire#s Lord Provost Bill Howatson made the debut official and cut the ribbon.Mr Howartson said: #It was an absolute honour to reopen the pool.#This has been an excellent example of work between the council and the community, I think the massive effort made by the community has paid off massively.#While a large portion of the work to reopen the pool was done throughout , the final week proved the toughest for the group.Kitted out in his finest Hawaiian shirt to mark the occasion and fortuitous turn in the weather Mr Hill of the group said: #It has been an absolute killer for us in terms of weather, we have had the worst April in the past -years in terms of being cold and wet, with the temperatures we couldn#t do anything.#Because of that this last week has really been a challenge, with this date in mind we have been painting throughout the week.#I know I joked around in my speech but it has been a pleasure

and been the beneficiary of several donations, including an anonymous deposit of £,.Mr Hill added: #We are all just so pleased to be able to have people back at the pool, after all working about , hours since August of last year and getting the professionals # the pool is alive again, without people it is just a hole in the ground.#Once the word gets out that we are open again people will come streaming down again.#Operations manager for Aberdeenshire Le, Tim Stephen added: #It is just fantastic to have something this big in Aberdeenshire, we are proud of all of our facilities but this is something special.#My mum and dad are coming up, in what will be the first time I have seen them in the past  months, to take a dip themselves and see the grandchildren.#Among those taking in the near  degree water, which is comparable to pools you#d find in Spain or Portugal, was -year-old Kat Awramenko.She said: #I was born here and have grown up alongside the pool and it is better than ever.#I have kept my outdoor swimming going by taking dips in lakes here and there but it is just so good to be back in the pool.#Also enjoying the sun, but waiting for a quieter day to take a plunge in the pool was Stonehaven and Lower Deeside councillor Wendy Agnew who added: #I learnt how to swim in this pool and it has taken many forms over the years.#I remember a time that Miss Stonehaven and comedy shows would be put on at the pool, it will now and always be an asset to the community.#One that people can come from far and wide to enjoy.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our

Slater claims it is #risky and dangerous# to leave oil and gas workers dependent on an industry that #must be phased out#.In our exclusive interview, the newly-elected MSP refused to be drawn on when she believes the industry should be wound down.However, she said her party want to #start cutting back the subsidies# and redirecting the money into renewable energy.The remarks come just days after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced talks are under way on a potential deal which could see Green politicians take ministerial posts in the SNP-run government.The plan has been criticised by Conservative MSPs across the North East region who claim the deal will #throw oil and gas jobs to the wolves#.But Ms Slater, who is currently working through her notice period as an electro-mechanical engineer in the renewable sector, believes the opposite is true.The Green MSP remained tight-lipped on statements she made in an online interview last year in which she suggsted a two to five-year timescale for winding down oil and gas.But she said #discussions# would need to take place about a date for phasing fossil fuels out.She added: #We have legal obligations to move to the Paris Agreement and that means North Sea oil and gas must be phased out.#We really can’t equivocate about that. But what we must make sure is that nobody’s livelihoods are effected, no communities are abandoned.#We all saw how Thatcher’s closing of the coal mines abandoned whole communities and left people destitute. We have the option not to do that.#The oil and gas industry is in decline, it has been declining, we’ve seen massive lay-offs.#The important thing is not to abandon people and communities, we want to build something sustainable.#We need to build industries that will take us into the next century. We need to think long-term. Oil and gas is certainly short-term.#The party#s co-leader says there is #absolutely no reason# why the transition away from fossil fuels should cause economic damage since Scotland is home to % of all the offshore renewable resources in Europe.However, she believes it comes down to a #question of priorities# for governments on how they choose to act going forward.Ms Slater adds: #I think it’s risky and dangerous to leave workers and the supply chains dependent on a declining industry.#Let’s be realistic, we know this is going to decline. Let’s not abandon people and communities to the mercy of the oil and gas corporations.#That’s the dangeryou leave this in their hands. Into government’s hands we can make sensible plans and really support people and communities properly.“Realistically to tackle the climate crisis, it has to be as quickly as possible.#When we talk about dates, we have to work together to work out what as fast as possible looks like but for the moment let’s agree the intention.”The MSP, who moved from Canada to work in Scotland#s renewable industry, says oil and gas is one of the #most subsidised industries in the world#.While it has in the past been a #big, growing industry#, Ms Slater claims this was a result of #deliberate government investment# and argues the same can now be achieved for the renewables sector.Ms Slater adds: #The oil industry went from nothing to quite a big thing over the course of about  years.#There’s no reason at all why with good investment and sound planning that we can’t build and create an equivalently large industry in renewable energy.#I think it’s a really exciting thing to be building something for the future.“We want to start cutting back the subsidies, cutting back the tax breaks for oil and gas and redirect that money into building all these new industries and supporting that.“With the first round of renewables, the government kind of just gave away our resources to global corporations and didn’t tie them down to contributing to our economy in the way that they could have done.“If I’m involved, we will do this dferently. Much more signicant percentages of their profits have to come back to local communities.#Oil and gas is wildly subsidised so the market is not level so as long as we’re subsidising oil and gas and making it cheaper to use gas then it is to electricity or other means.#As long as the government has their thumb on the balance of the market, of course there’s going to be demand for oil and gas because it’s cheaper and it’s subsidised.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/05/vaccine-rollout-140521-e1621007541735-300x180.jpg class=attachment-part-medium size-part-medium wp-post-image ","title":"coronavirus in scotland track the spread in these charts and maps2001","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remWe#ve put together a collection of daily updated charts and maps to track the coronavirus crisis in Scotland.The table below shows an at-a-glance view of the situation in each local authority. It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began.After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus.The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-.

doors bout at the Northern Hotel, Aberdeen.The Aberdeen Assassin previously defeated former WBA Pan-African title holder Djarbeng in October  when the Ghanaian quit after the second round.The call for a rematch came after McAllister had travelled to Ghana in March and defeated Collison Corley in Djarbeng#s home city of Accra.Djarbeng felt it should have been him facing McAllister.He fired off a broad-side in the Ghanaian press calling for a shot at revenge, insisting he suffered broken fingers in the original bout and would be too strong for McAllisterthey were to fight again.Angered by his comments McAllister sent a contract for a rematch to his management which was quickly signed for a fight that will be broadcast live and free to view on Fite  TV and Viva Live TV.McAllister said: #They were the ones screaming for the rematch and I certainly didn#t chase them.#I don#t need Richmond, he is the one that wants to put the record straight by beating me.#Richmond feels that he was at a disadvantage because of the injury last time we fought.“Following my fight in Ghana back in March, he threw down the gauntlet in an interview, claiming he can beat mewe fought again.“His main argument seems to be that since we last fought he’s won both his fights by stoppage, and he thinks he can do the same against me now he’s fully fit.#I decided to let him try.#There is no pressure on me.#McAllister comprehensively defeated Djarbeng at Balgownie, Aberdeen in October .He dominated the original fight against a boxer renowned as a front-foot fighter.This time he expects #fireworks# at the Northern Hotel as they go again.McAllister said: #He has an attitude towards me and clearly has an issue so we just have to get on with it in the ring.#Richmond is certainly not the cool, calm customer from the last time as his whole body language and aggressive talk looks like it will make for fireworks when we fight.#He looks like someone that is going for it.#Djarbeng, --is a former West African Union welterweight champion and  recently secured a points defeat of Zakaria Salu in his home city of Accra, the Ghanaian capital.In calling for a rematch Djarbeng insisted he was too strong for McAllister and only lost because he had broken fingers.McAllister offered  the Accra based fighter a rematch either in Aberdeen in May or Ghana in July.Multiple belt champion McAllister insists he is in the best shape for years after a punishing training camp in preparation for the rematch.He said: #I feel in cracking shape and have really peaked.#I have been smashing the bags in the gym and feel as sharp as I have felt for a long time.#I feel on top of the world and am ready to take anyone on.#I can’t wait to be back fighting in my home town again as I’ve not boxed in Aberdeen since late .#I#m buzzing to get back in the ring and continue to put my city on the boxing map.#When I fought Richmond in Aberdeen previously there were  people in a marquee.#It was an amazing atmosphere and to have that at a boxing night is key.#I am looking forward to getting fans back at fights soon.#Now , McAllister has no thoughts of retiring from the ring and insists his drive for title success remains fierce.He said: #I have achievements I want to reach and am still hungry for belts.#That hunger for glory is still there.#Fighting on the undercard is PBC WBU International super lightweight champion

That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#The question posed by the surveyor should, of course, have been: #Are you opposed to further development of onshore wind #In Scotland today we have , operational turbines# that#s more than the rest of the UK put together.We also have , consented  under construction and a further , in the planning system according to an FOI response from the Scottish Government.These figures change on an almost daily basis as applications continue to pile in unabated.How many people are going to continue to support onshore wind when they witness the total annihilation of this country It would also be interesting to know exactly where the data from #rural Scotland# was collected. Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying.

As the founders of the NHS said: #From the cradle to the grave#.Hiding in plain sight in this report, in the small print, is this statement: #Politicians, health care professionals and the public must all be involvedour primary care system is to survive.# As Oprah Winfrey would put it, #WHAT # If this is what is at stake, why have we not heard more about it  Why was it enough to contact so few people among our erse population Why has health management locally cast our group out in the cold We are open to all and represent a wide cross section of community interests. And their latest distancing act is to #temporarily suspend# public representation on its Integration Joint Board.I am coming to believe that this critical situation has overtaken long-held belief systems that need to be challenged.In NHS values, the first statement is #working together for patients.#That is well out of date increasingly the patient has been a participator in their care, and the duty of obtaining consent means you can’t have treatment without co-operation.This report goes on to make clear that #collaboration# is a key requirement. That means we are an essential part of the system.It seems clear that we are going to have to fight to get past the unconscious assumptions of decision makers.

We once again highlighted our concerns over a lack of immediate action on the crisis at the Rest and be ThankfulDear Roy and Hugh,I am writing in response to an official Transport Scotland email to the Rest and be Thankful Campaign on the April , where you have sought to answer several questions posed by us at our meeting with your officials and in subsequent emails to you both. We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states #we are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace# yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.We believe creating  options for consultation in November  and five further options for consultation in March was a time-wasting exercise. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.A geological survey, which will take  months to complete, could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides.The email states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use#, yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for Transport Scotland which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in - weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay.It further declares that #we understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts#.While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside or people#s homes you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful. What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in Transport Scotland#s official reply or in recent press statements:If the next landslide, or subsequent ersion along the equally inadequate A, results in a fatality who will be held accountable Who is responsible for the social and economic impact on the people and businesses of Argyll while we wait another  years for something permanent to be done We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament.We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two km of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach.We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful.John Gurr, chairman, The Rest and be Thankful CampaignSir,Mental Health Awareness Week opened on Monday May  and we are inviting everyone to #ConnectWithNature to support their mental health.Spending quality time in and around nature can help to reduce stress and increase feelings of positivity, and you don’t have to be surrounded by fields or have to take a walk in the wilderness to feel the benefits.The Mental Health Foundation, which works to prevent mental health problems and has organised this awareness week for the past  years, encourages you to recognise and grow your connection with nature by sharing a photo, video or sound recording with your family and friends, and on your social media.Connecting with nature can really make a dference to your mental health, and now more than ever, it is time to look after yours.Julie Walters, actorSir,Alan Reid, Dunoon"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside kids vote for nature","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

However, there now seems to be an acceptance in Transport Scotland that a new solution has to be found.In a letter to the press, George Allan points out that the -mile route from Strathlachlan to Colintraive and the eight miles between Ormidale and Tighnabruaich were designed and constructed in  or  years.I was a member of the survey and design team on these routes. I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.Philip Shimmin, Inverness.Sir,I would like to say thank you to all the lads who have been working at the Crinan Canal # often when the north winds were blowing and water was pouring down from the hills into the empty canal more quickly than the pumps were able to remove it.The men greeted me each morning as I walked past to go over the temporary bridge. They were trying to renew the basement concrete which supports the new bridges in spite of the wet, cold weather.Fortunately, April was drier and they managed to fit the new gates thanks to the massive cranes and the skill of the lorry drivers carrying these heavy loads to and from the canal.Others have cleared the rubbish, including lots of old car tyres, which had been dumped.It is good to see the canal filled and in working order again.J Thorgrimsson, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"summer in the garden roses and relaxing","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

With the evenings getting longer and brighter you can use your garden or patio as a great extension to your home and just sit back and relax.It’s at this time of year that lawns need to be mowed more frequently, so here are some key pointers on getting that perfect cared-for look.Mow at least once a week and raise the mower blades when it’s very hot weather. Don’t mow when grass is wet or during a drought and don’t collect your clippings during dry spells as this helps conserve moisture.Keep watering throughout the summer unless there is a water shortage and repair bare patches with turf or re-seeding.This is also the month to ensure that all your plants are adequately fed, particularly those in baskets and tubs.Plants benefit from a regular feeding programme as they are growing vigorously and need their nutrition levels to be kept up. Slow-release granules are a good idea for pots and baskets because they last for about six months and release food as it is required into the compost.Not often thought of as a container plant, but an excellent option for small gardens, is a rose.A simple solution for June is to create an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.Just buy a selection of dferent sized pots, plant them with a ieties of roses and then place them together in a group.There is a rose for every garden situation. From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew. Pruning is also important to remove dead heads and improve flowering over a longer period of time.If you are replacing old roses with new ones, ensure that the old soil is removed and replaced with fresh soil.As the temperature rises and midsummer day arrives, here are few ‘must do’ jobs for the garden this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters a unique holiday destination","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But never mind, Chinese astronauts, who regard a moon base as essential for probing outer space, have just about solved these problems with a bioregenerative le support system called Yuegong-, or Lunar Palace  . LP is a temperature and humidity-controlled, sealed, articial human-animal-plant-microorganism ecosystem in which oxygen, water and food sources are recycled to create an Earth-like environment. The latest experiment had LP in use continuously for a whole year, with two crews of four each having two periods of occupation and the maximum stay being  days. All emerged fit and healthy.LP comprises a living area, two cabins for growing plants , an animal-raising room housing yellow mealworms and waste treatment and storage rooms.Crew requirements # food, water, oxygen and waste disposal # are accommodated as follows: plants and mealworms provide food, the latter being processed into ‘flour’ for bread.Plant photosynthesis provides oxygen and consumes CO, while puried water from plant transpiration and condensation provides drinking and washing water.Nitrogen puried from crew urine generates plant fertiliser, while the remaining urine is puried along with waste water for plant irrigation.Crew faeces mixed with straw are fermented by bacteria to produce CO for plant photosynthesis, while fermented vegetable waste is fed to the mealworms. The whole system achieved  per cent recycling, the only non-recyclable product requiring storage being solid waste from fermented faeces.All this represents huge progress, but we are not there yet. Running LP requires massive energy input, particularly since lunar days and nights each last an Earth month, and the nights are freezing.But still, I have read of plans to build kilometre-high lunar towers bearing solar  , possible because of the moon’s zero gravity, but don’t hold your breath!* https:doi.org . ...# arxiv.org abs ."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures may 21 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"enjoy running a mok but please do so safely","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The email states: #We are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace#, yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.Creating  options for consultation in November , this, we believe, is a time-wasting exercise. Five further options for consultation in March. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report. Conducting a geological survey which will take eighteen months to complete, a process that could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides. It also states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use.# Yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for TS which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in  to  weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay. It further declares: #We understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts.#While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll, should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment. This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside, or people#s homes, you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at RABT.What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the Rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in TS#s official reply or in recent press statements:We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management, and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament. We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two kilometres of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach. We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the RABT.We stand at a once-in-a-generation crossroads.Earlier this week, a thought-provoking poem, ACCEPTABLE  by the Anonymous Mother # judged for needing a food bank to feed her child # started a nationwide debate about whether the world#s fth richest country should need food banks to feed children.This conversation needed to happen as our food bank crisis has become critical.Last year food banks in the Trussell Trust#s network handed out , emergency food parcels for children in the UK. This surely cannot be acceptable.However, fate has given us a rare opportunity, as history shows us that the best time to create a brighter future is after times of great darkness.The pandemic has been the most devastating event to hit our country since the Second World War, but it also brought out the very best of our nation.We recognised our real community heroes, we protected the vulnerable, we didn#t stand by when kids went hungry.But now, as we prepare to wake up from the pandemic nightmare, millions of British families still cannot afford food on their table.As the Anonymous Mother poetically says # it doesn#t need to be this way.In , Britain woke up to its new dawn at a similar crossroads # go back to the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to make things better.That great generation chose hope, and created a better, fairer society for all # including founding the NHS.This pandemic has been our generation#s darkest hour. This is now our new dawn, our choice. Will we choose the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to eradicate hunger in the UK I urge you to do just one thing today, and that is to seek out the poem that started all of this, and reflect.If, afterwards, you agree with me and the hundreds of thousands of other supporters of the Trussell Trust, that we can do better, join us as we collectively create a #hunger free future#."},{"url":null,"title":"safety first as shops reopen","story":"Wyvex MediaUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It#s a really exciting move as it offers the potential to climb the Scottish football pyramid.#From the club#s point of view, we want to find our standard amongst the new teams joining the set up.#We want to be the best we can be as the senior team of the Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.#With our acceptance into the WoSFL, we can offer a pathway for the youngest age groups right through to the under- side, being trained by Stuart Crossan, into our first team, representing Campbeltown in non-league football.#With that, it#s important to acknowledge the huge amount of hard work that has gone into making Campbeltown#s community club a Gold Merit Award holder, one of only seven clubs in the Scottish Football AssociationWest region, encompassing all of Glasgow and the west. This accolade was a major factor in our acceptance into the WoSFL.#Other factors in the Pupils# favour before WoSFL committee scrutiny included having changing facilities for two teams of up to  players each, a separate referee#s room, and an enclosed ground with spectator barriers.Campbell said of the club#s Kintyre Park home: #The renovation of the pavilion is nearing completion, through a fundraising campaign led by club chairman Alex McKinven.#Campbell added: #The SAFL was a great  for us to play competitive amateur football for  years. In periods, we went through some wilderness years but we have happy memories of successful title-winning seasons, too.#In recent seasons, however, the club became disillusioned with how the league was going, with dficulty getting referees and sometimes teams to travel to Kintyre at a week#s notice – this was not a feature against even rival teams in years gone by.#In the WosFL, our geography could not be a determining factor in league entry as we are SFA West region members, which meant that the criteria we could meet on a match day, and the quality of our community club pathway, mattered most.#Meanwhile, the Pupils are gearing up for le in the WoSFL with contact training resuming on Tuesday evening.The team have been training twice weekly in a non-contact setting to build up their base fitness since March.Campbell added: #Training has been well attended, led by coaches Norman Thomson and Lewis Mackay, and although it has been hard to get the players together with ongoing restrictions, the squad are right behind the move and excited about the challenge ahead.#Campbeltown Pupils are keen to hear from anyone who would be able to help with ground and park maintenance.

As German troops advanced through Normandy, the st fought valiantly, protecting French citizens, hoping evacuation by sea would be forthcoming.On June  , German tanks surrounded the ision at the French fishing port of St Valéry. This, alongside a curtain of heavy fog, made the long-awaited flotilla rescue unviable and they were forced to surrender. Those who were not killed in the fighting were captured as prisoners of war and marched to camps in Eastern Europe, where they remained for five gruelling years.Following the commemorations to mark the th anniversary of the battle last June, a remarkable story has emerged. One brave soldier miraculously evaded capture and was taken in by a French family who hid him from the occupying German forces.#We were contacted by Monsieur Patrick Prieur, a -year-old St Valéry resident whose grandparents and father remained in the town during the entirety of the war. He told us the story of the escapee and the tragedy that befell him,# said Dr Claire Armstrong, chief executive of Legion Scotland.#As we approach the st anniversary of the battle, we hope to identy this Scottish hero, give him the recognition he deserves and bring peace to his family.#Patrick Prieur recalled the tale his late father told him: #A soldier from the st Highland Division was hidden by a family in the village. They bonded and the family learned he was a married man with a we and two daughters waiting for him tohome.#For several weeks, the soldier remained hidden but, regretfully, he was eventually discovered by German troops and marched through the town to the municipal cemetery.#After being forced to dig his own grave, he was positioned against the cemetery wall and shot. His death deeply upset the townspeople, who had been aware of his hiding, and especially my father, who was only  at the time.#In later years, the Franco-British military cemetery was built and his body was moved there. His grave is marked as #Known unto God# and my father and other villagers tended to it for decades after the war ended.#Monsieur Prieur added: #My father had been gted a piece of paper on which the soldier#s name was written, #Keller Len Scott#, and this became his prized possession. He desperately wanted to find the soldier#s family to tell them what had happened to their beloved and where he was laid to rest, but having very little information, he struggled.#In  my father passed away and, being eager to finish what he started, I recently contacted Poppyscotland and the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association to ask for help.#Michelle McKearnon, head of engagement at the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association, said: #We started to do our own research to unearth the fallen soldier#s identity but only got so far. We believe the name order on the piece of paper may have been written in military fashion, with the surname preceding any given names, so the family name might be Keller.#We#re now at an impasse, struggling to find additional information through our own resources, so we need the knowledge of the wider community to continue our efforts.#Dr Armstrong added: #We are urging anyone who believes they know of or has any information about our #Unknown Soldier#, no matter how small, to get in touch.#This brave man fought valiantly for his country and to repay our debt to him for his service would be an honour, not only for Legion Scotland as custodians of remembrance, but for his family, Monsieur Prieur#s father, the people of St Valéry and, ultimately, for all the #unknown soldiers# who sacriced their lives for us.#Anyone with information that could help identy the soldier should visit poppyscotland.org.uk stvalery"},{"url":null,"title":"engines at the ready mach 1 stages rally gets go ahead","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

They did notto the harbour until after pm with the casualty in tow.The following day, Sceptre skipper Tom Smith praised the hard work and efficiency of the Campbeltown leboat crews.Diver Robert Lamont, a member of the leboat crew the night before, went in and removed the damaged rudder ready for Sceptre to be towed by tug to Troon, the finish of the race.The race sails from Oban to Mull, Jura and Arran then Troon, stopping at each island for a team of runners to complete a hill race.Sceptre, with a crew of four, was carrying the boys# team from Glenalmond School, Perth.She had run aground the night before entering Craighouse, Jura. Everything looked fine on the yacht, which was built in Argyll at Alexander Robertson#s Holy Loch yard to compete in the America#s Cup of .#As a precaution, we did not have the boys on board for the tough leg round the Mull of Kintyre to Arran,# said crew member Roger Finbow.#They haven#t missed the race they were on board Blue Damsel, carrying the girls# team.#The decision proved a wise move as not only did the rudder come loose leaving the yacht with no steering, it was flapping wildly and in danger of damaging the hull.As a precaution, the leboat crew put a heavy-duty pump on board but this was not needed.HMS Dragon broke off her sea trials to come to the aid of Sceptre. The Type  Clyde-built destroyer stood by until the leboat arrived.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOCalls were mounting earlier this week for a Scottish Office decision on the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Northern Ireland.The Scottish Office has been considering a business plan for state-owned Caledonian MacBrayne to operate the link with Ballycastle in Northern Ireland since the beginning of February.The company needs Scottish Office permission to become involved in the project.But concern is growing that unless a decision is made soon the necessary harbour work at Campbeltown will not start until it is too late for the service to begin next year.Two Campbeltown ambulance men were among six from Argyll recently presented with long service and good conduct medals by the Duke of Argyll.Ronnie Hamilton and Malcolm Black travelled to Oban for the presentation, carried out by the Duke on behalf of HM Queen.The medals are not awarded automatically but are made on the recommendation of a special .The Duke told the ambulance men: #What you do is not a profession, it is a vocation.#He also paid tribute to their families, pointing out the ambulance men worked anti-social hours for long periods at a time.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown was #switched on# to colour television on Tuesday by the town#s new Provost, William Craig, in his first official engagement.The service has been brought to Campbeltown by Redfusion, the firm which pipes television to several thousand subscribers from its mast at Crosshill Farm.The firm#s Scottish general manager Mr Colin Payne said that Redfusion offers a public service of which they were proud.#We looked at the television problems here. There were just BBC and STV and occasionally Ulster in the town.#We said can we bring to Campbeltown the full range of colour programmes which are available where and the answer to that was #yes#.#There are now six programmes on the system. There aren#t many places in the country which can receive this.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOAn English steam liner which called in here for bait one day last week had full bunkers and a plentul reserve of coal in ious corners. She had gone to Ostende for the fuel.A further restriction of the gas supply in the burgh comes into force on Saturday night. The hours during which there will be reduced and normal pressure respectively are given in advertisement.The local branch of the Miners# Union opened a subscription list this week for the purpose of starting a communal soup kitchen. It is not intended, of course, to confine the benefits of the scheme to miners or their dependents. Over £ has already been raised and the committee intend to publish the list of subscriptions next week.A welcome break in our comparative isolation from the mainland was made at the beginning of the week when the steamer Kinloch made a special run to the upper reaches, with mail, passengers and cargo.Many merchants, not only in Campbeltown but at Carradale and the west of Arran ports, were carrying very low stocks and this run was not made a day too soon to prevent absolute scarcity of not a few necessities.Flour, for one thing, was running very short, and the new supplies got by bakers were very much-needed.Alcohol is again tipped as a likely rival to petrol. The new motor fuel is being produced by the Distillers Company Ltd and consists of a mixture of  per cent of alcohol,  per cent of benzole and  per cent of paraffin. The idea of using alcohol is not new, but a fatal obstacle has been the unwillingness of the government to release its hold upon alcohol and permit it to be used for commercial purposes."},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and Be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.This week, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulancemarks its eighth anniversary – after a year like no other.Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, our Helimed crews have never missed a beat maintaining our emergency helicopter air ambulance service across Scotland#s mainland and island communities. In fact we#ve enhanced our service with the launch of a new aircraft – Helimed  in Aberdeen last year – which has already had a huge impact on pre-hospital care in the Grampian, Highland and island regions.In our busiest year ever, our aircrew have endured challenging working conditions, with additional procedures and cumbersome protective and safety equipment as they go about an already dficult and stressful job.But they#re not complaining – this is what the Scottish public ask of them, to save and improve lives, wherever the need arises, and they fulfil their role with courage and pride.Our exemplary performance during this national crisis has been a tribute to how far SCAA has come in just eight years and I, for one, am immensely proud of what the SCAA team has achieved.But our operational teams are acutely aware that we are only able to provide this critical service, thanks to the continued public donations which you have maintained throughout these dficult times. So you are the real heroes in our charity.SCAA is the people#s helicopter – funded by the people of Scotland, for the people of Scotland – and our two frontline aircraft are stood by ready to help you, your family, your friends, colleagues, neighbours or anyone in your community when you most need us.As we mark our eighth birthday on May , we are asking the people of Scotland,they can, to support us into the future. Any donation, however small, to celebrate our anniversary will help to save a le – just like the numerous lives we have already saved over almost , missions.SCAA vows to continue to transform emergency care in Scotland, particularly to our rural and island communities, with your support. Thank you.As a coalition of leading providers of care and support to vulnerable children and young people, we congratulate all MSPs on their election and welcome the consensus there is between the major political parties to tackle the growing mental health crisis in our young people.We have for some time raised concerns over a potential lost generation of vulnerable children and young people, whose mental health is being impacted even further by the Covid- pandemic.There have been dramatically increased waiting times for mental health treatment during lockdown.In December , for example,  per cent of children and young people had been waiting more than a year for specialist treatment, compared with . per cent in , a truly frightening statistic.A commitment by MSPs to focus on mental health, increasing investment in support services and intervention strategies, must be a priority for this parliament, giving our young people the care and support they need, when they need it.The frightening statistics on the deteriorating mental health of many young people presents a compelling case for a radical new plan for our struggling mental health services and for a national crusade to address what is a mental health pandemic, underpinned by considerably greater resourcing.This is a crisis we can overcome, but it will require a similar energy and commitment to that demonstrated for Covid-we are to achieve this and prevent many young people giving up on their futures.At sight loss charity RNIB Scotland, we are concerned the Covid- crisis might have impacted on people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older.We would like to highlight the emotional reassurance and practical help we offer during the coronavirus lockdown and its aftermath.Covid has eclipsed all other health news in the past year but  people still start to lose their sight in Scotland every week. Add to that stress over Covid and the lockdowns and there could be more people needing support and reassurance.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute and the Western Highlands for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as families, friends and carers.Losing your sight can be devastating news to take in. But our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.The uncertainty during the Covid lockdown over access to basic shopping and medication, a lack of information in accessible formats, the social isolation, the barriers to being guided because of social distancing # these have all added to and compounded the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.But we want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.To contact the Need to Talk service, phone the RNIB Helpline on    or email needtotalk@rnib.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types, providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew.Pruning is also important to remove dead heads and improve flowering over a longer period of time.If you are replacing old roses with new ones, ensure that the old soil is removed and replaced with fresh soil.As the temperature rises and Midsummer#s Day arrives, here are few #must do# jobs for the garden this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:CAPTION:June is the perfect month for creating an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.

This provided learners with the opportunity to see new words and phrases and gave fluent speakers the chance to use Gaelic outside the classroom.It was the young learners who really caught the judges# attention though, with their production, Èirich.Èirich tells the story of a social media trend that transports people into a dangerous new world, with some students caught in an infinite loop and others caught by the #person in the shadows#.Councillor Robin Currie, leader of Argyll and Bute Council, said: #Every year this competition attracts a huge number of high quality entries from learners across Scotland, and it is an honour that our young people made it to the final.#These talented filmmakers from Islay High School have created two exceptional productions and I#m very, very proud of them.#Gaelic has played an important role in the history of Argyll and Bute for many, many years and we#re committed to continuing to promote the language and its culture to our communities.#Gaelic education is offered in more than  of our primary schools and five secondary schools.#There has been an increase in interest in Gaelic Medium Education, which will have a positive impact on future generations of Gaelic speakers.

Mr Mitchell acknowledged receipt of these answers.I was alarmed and saddened by the headline #Failing# school is #betraying# pupils and the community# in last week#s Courier.Coming from a retired Campbeltown Grammar Schoolteacher, it is hard to believe that someone who has worked in the profession could have such criticism for his her fellow colleagues.Although clearly passionate about the future of CGS, perhaps retirement has helped this inidual forget what a challenging job all school staff face.It is commonly known that CGS has not had its troubles to seek in recent years with major staff shortages due to ill health and other unforeseen circumstances.The league tables do not make good reading but, on their own, I don#t think they reflect the efforts of the staff.It is a well known fact that you can take a horse to water but you cannot make it drink. Is the behaviour of pupils the greatest barrier to success Despite the efforts of teachers to discipline the pupils, there are few deterrents for the offenders, especially where the pupil is aware that,they ask, the parent will fight their corner instead of backing the school.The responsibility of teaching our children to behave and respect others needs to be instilled from early years by us all and not just when the child reaches CGS.Maybe the retired teacher should offer his her skills and visit CGS and see the problems that all staff are facing It is time for the community to pull together and support our school and encourage our children to believe that a good education is very achievable in CGS.Recently, an investigation by the Herald newspaper uncovered that #just over half of Scotland#s leline ferry network is operating outwith its working le expectancy#, with  vessels out of  in operation over  years old.Despite the huge challenges created by the Covid- pandemic that our hard-working ferry crews have to deal with,  residents rightly expect a high quality ferry service that runs on time and has enough space to ensure they can travel to and from the islands, businesses can transport goods to the mainland and tourists can visit our islands to boost the economy.Unfortunately, cancellations and delays continue to plague routes. I have been working closely with residents, our community councils and other parties to find long-term solutions.This pressing matter simply can#t be left on the backburner.The  National Lottery Awards are now open for entries.Once again, the annual search for the UK#s favourite National Lottery-funded people and projects will recognise those iniduals and organisations who have made an extraordinary impact in their community – especially during these unprecedent times.National Lottery players raise £ million every week for good causes and we know this money is being used in amazing and inspiring ways.As part of The National Lottery Awards, we want to celebrate those whose selfless dedication and fantastic work makes such a dference in villages, towns and cities across the country.Encompassing all areas of National Lottery funding, you nominate local legends and hometown heroes in the following categories: culture, arts and film, community charity, heritage and sport.In addition, there will be a young hero award for someone under the age of .Groups or organisations are eligible to enter The National Lottery Project of the Year category, where shortlisted finalists will face a public vote later in the year.All award winners will receive an iconic National Lottery Awards trophy and £, for their organisation.Nominations can be made by completing an entry form on our website at www.lotterygoodcauses.org.uk awards.All nominees must have been funded by The National Lottery or be associated with a National Lottery funded project.

Play is a hugely important part of childhood and has a whole host of benefits, including improving physical and mental health and wellbeing.Throughout this pandemic, children have had to deal with so many dficult challenges some having to stay in unsafe homes and many living with families who are struggling with health worries and financial issues.Children have told Childline that they have struggled to cope and their mental health has suffered as a result.It doesn#t matter how people choose to play this Childhood Day , whether it#s organising a sponsored kickabout in the park, a game of cards, a musical get-together or an online gaming tournament, we just want as many as possible playing and raising money to help us keep children safe.We look forward to hearing how your readers plan to support the NSPCC and children across Scotland this Childhood Day.To find out more and download a fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk childhoodday or search online for NSPCC Childhood Day."},{"url":null,"title":"look out little explorers about","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is a big commitment for the school, requiring  hours of #on site# work.After finding out about Scottish-born American naturalist John Muir, his love for nature and his environmental work, the children mapped along their nearest beach and undertook a beach clean.Nearby, the pupils discovered a trig point and a lookout or watchtower.They are interested in finding out more about Kintyre#s lookout towers and are appealing to Courier readers with any information or stories to send them letters to: Rhunahaorine Primary School, Tayinloan, Tarbert, PA XG.Some of the children are also interested in the rocks on the beach beside the lookout tower at Rhunahaorine.They collected ious examples and took turns smashing them in the hope of finding geodes – crystals or other mineral matter – inside. They discovered lots of interesting patterns but no real geodes – this is perhaps a lelong project for some.Other pupils are interested in the shells and crabs on the beach. Crabs #body parts# are often collected and it is deemed a good finda moveable claw or leg can be worked.During one visit, the youngsters searched for shark egg cases and, after what seemed to be a fruitless hunt, more than  were found in one morning when their eyes became accustomed to what they were searching for. Their findings were submitted to the Shark Trust.Head teacher Catriona Brown told the Courier she was #very impressed# with the children#s enthusiasm and commitment throughout the project so far.Mrs Brown hopes to be able to share in the near futureany of the children achieve the award."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 28 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Did he feel embarrassed in front of his friends who did not share his doubts, did he feel ashamed that his faith had not remained resolute or was he able to put those feelings aside and share the joy of the risen Lord We do know that Thomas responded with the words: #My Lord and my God.#More than two thousand years later, we may feel embarrassedour faith falters and doubts set in.However, we should focus on the happiness of which Jesus speaks.Have the strength and hope to echo the words of Thomas: #My Lord and my God.#Do not beat yourself up for doubting – have the strength to believe."},{"url":null,"title":"author meyrick moves into gangland territory","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

James VI also came to the Bass in  as a guest of a later Lauder he liked the island so much that he offered to purchase it, but here he was snubbed.During the reign of Charles II, the Bass became a notorious prison, mainly used for the Covenanters.As many as  of these religious dissidents were held on the island, under appalling conditions: there was a well that produced fresh water, but fresh meat was a scarcity and the fishy taste of the seabirds was a torment to the wretched prisoners.In , four Jacobite officers were imprisoned on the Bass but they successfully took over control of the island and ordered the garrison to depart. After reinforcements had been received, they withstood a siege of nearly three years, under trying conditions, before they surrendered with full military honours in May .The Bass later passed into the ownership of the Dalrymple family, to which it still belongs today.The Bass Rock lighthouse was constructed in  by the celebrated engineer David Stevenson, a cousin of Robert Louis.

There, a writer can still explore pretty much anything they want without bowing to the expectations of an online mob.Literature has become, with almost perfect irony, the last safe space in the digital age ndash where the most discomfiting issues can be poked on the anatomy table without the stultying dread that exploration of an ugly, dficult idea somehow equates to support for that ugly, dficult idea.Second Place tells the story of a privileged woman, known as M, who invites a shallow narcissistic artist, known as L, to stay at her country home. M has built a holiday cottage ndash a \"second place\" ndash nearby, and fantasises about running her own chic salon.Cusk is a skilled social satirist. Her novel eviscerates that strangest of all modern social classes, \"the bohemian bourgeoisie\" ndash that branch of the affluent middle class, mostly living in relative luxury through inherited wealth, which rejects the conformity of the nine-to-five world, in favour of a throuple or a splf after a Nigella dinner cooked on the Aga.M imagines that shersquos dferent, new and liberated. In fact, with the cruellest of ironies, M is submissive towards men she sees as strong and potent. She sneers at \"soft\" men. Shersquos whiny, a pain. That doesnrsquot make the book bad ndash it makes it great. M is a real character, in all her messy contradictory glory, not some meme of fake female perfection.Cusk does for the women of todayrsquos bohemian bourgeoisie what Gustave Flaubert did to the women of the th-century bourgeoisie ndash mocks them. There are many comparisons to be found between Flaubertrsquos Emma Boy and Cuskrsquos M: both dreamy romantics who build castles in the air, only for reality to come crashing down. The key dference, of course, is that Emma, a male creation, lived in a society where women were ruined for breaking rules. M breaks rules but others suffer ndash chiefly her partner Tony, the bookrsquos only \"good\" character, whose stolid masculinity, though, is also there for mockery.The problem for Cusk is that her reputation precedes her. Some of her non-fiction has been thoroughly isive. Cuskrsquos orce memoir Aftermath was the subject of a brutal critical hate-fest. In some quarters, she was painted as narcissistic, petty, cruel, thoughtless, privileged and self-indulgent. Pretty much the characteristics which comprise M.The idea that fiction reflects its authors soul is a modern nonsense, however. As a novelist, Irsquove written fiction about medieval heretics and child murderers in the s. I assure you Irsquove experience of neither. Cusk ndash like all storytellers ndash employs her imagination. Clearly, she has truths about herself to tell, but she seems to keep a firm iding line between fiction and non-fiction. Second Place may draw on Cuskrsquos le but it isnrsquot \"about her\".Yet, the hostility towards Cuskrsquos latest book, from some quarters, can almost be foretold. That whiny character M will be seen as her ndash petty, spoilt, brattish. No writer of Cuskrsquos skill would be shallow enough to create a character like M by way of some sneaky tribute to themselves. We must credit the author with more intelligence and sophistication. Cusk makes clear she knows her character is a pretentious pain, albeit an honest one. ldquoIrsquom determined not to falsy anything even for the sake of narrative, M says.Cusk is a gted writer. Her Outline trilogy was an elegant fictional observation of st-century le though the eyes of a savvy, flawed, reflective woman. Cusk is a voyager of female consciousness. Much of her writing brings to mind work by two other great women novelists: Clarice Lispector, best known for Hour of the Star in , and Jean Rhys who wrote Wide Sargasso Sea in . Both women ndash as with Cusk ndash hacked their way, with ruthless honesty, through forests of misogyny and female desire brave and unabashed pioneers. Cusk follows their path, though at a gentler, more rarefied, slower pace.Most of all though ndash and this is what makes Cusk worthy of the word \"great\", at least to some extent ndash shersquos bidding to be a successor to Milan Kundera. Shersquos engaged in an exploration of being ndash of the philosophical underpinnings of what makes us human. Echoes of Kunderarsquos The Unbearable Lightness of Being float through Second Place.Like Emma Boy and many Kundera characters, M thinks she can turn her le into a work of art. She puts art on a pedestal and kneels before it. In doing so, she risks destruction. We humans are real, after all, not works of art. Like Muriel Sparkrsquos character Lise in The Driverrsquos Seat, M is engaged in searching for her own destruction at the hands of men. Thatrsquos a brave, dark idea to explore in .Cuskrsquos novel falls down in one crucial respect. Right at the end ndash after the novel closes ndash Cusk surfaces to tell us that Second Place is inspired by Lorenzo in Taos, Mabel Dodge Luhanrsquos memoir of the time DH Lawrence came to stay with her in New Mexico. The M and the L characters, a clear rf on Luhanrsquos tale. Irsquom one of a dwindling band of weirdos alive whorsquove read Luhanrsquos book ndash and only then because I studied Lawrence at university.Such literary showing off is entirely unnecessary. Second Place didnrsquot need characters pointlessly called M or L ndash just give them names, for pitys sake ndash nor a narrative conceit lted from Luhan. Any novel should be able to stand on its own two feet. Second Place can easily do that to seek validity from a book few today have read is pointless, and just givesCuskrsquos critics another excuse to attack her."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12632370.jpg?type=article-full","title":"portfolio-tatjana-patitz-le-touquet-1986-peter-lindbergh","story":"Alaiarsquos body-fitting yet flattering clothes and Lindberghrsquos striking black and white photographs were essential components of the careers of Cindy Crawford, Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Tatjana Patitz and Naomi Campbell, who even slept in Alaiarsquos workshop when she arrived in Paris, aged .Both men found each other in their adopted city of Paris and began to work together, sharing a love of monotone and strong women. ldquoWe met in , I believe.

The idea was sparked by McTavishrsquos love of clan heritage, something that Heughan equally became fascinated with while making Outlander, a time-travelling drama set in th-century Scotland.Heughan describes Men In Kilts as ldquoa love letter to Scotland, while McTavish bills it as ldquothe trip of a letime. Their enthusiasm is infectious as they delve into everything from langoustine fishing and the art of making whisky to witchcraft, ancient rituals and standing stones.Sweeping landscapes and dramatic aerial shots abound, but the best bits are when McTavish and Heughan are trundling along in their trusty campervan exchanging witty banter and mock barbs.Graham McTavish and Sam Heughan go langoustine fishing during their Scottish road trip for the TV series Men In Kilts.

The TV series was shown in the US earlier this year and has newly begun airing on this side of the Atlantic, available via the on-demand streaming service StarzPlay.Each half-hour episode centres on a theme, journeying through food and drink, sport, song and dance, witchcraft and superstition, Scotland by land, air and sea, as well as tradition, clans and tartans, and the Battle of Culloden.The end result is proper feel-good telly. Fans of the funny, le-affirming Mortimer  Whitehouse: Gone Fishing will find Men In Kilts similarly entertaining viewing ndash it is in that same rich vein of two good friends enjoying a shared pilgrimage and zest for adventure.It is an odyssey fuelled by lashings of caffeine, good humour, adrenalin, drams of whisky, and apparently, in Heughanrsquos case, a desire to devise increasingly fiendish methods to terry McTavish .Coming up with the itinerary, they admit, was a tricky business. ldquoWe had to narrow it down because we wanted to go to loads of places, says McTavish. ldquoWe had to be realistic about where we could actually go. There were logistical factors involved.ldquoGiven the fact that we did manage to get across to Lewis and Islay and go up to Inverness, it was an extraordinarily circuitous journey.

There were possibly two things you were insistent about: the Islay distillery and the surfing [on Lewis]. You were very enthusiastic about the surfing.The series is aimed predominantly at a US audience ndash co-produced by Sony Pictures Television which makes Outlander for Starz ndash but there are subtle cultural references woven throughout that will give many Scots a good chuckle.How did they go about striking a balance between trying to entertain and impart knowledge, in the first instance, to viewers who may not know Scotland all that well, while ensuring that the programme didnrsquot potentially jar with those watching on these shores ldquoThe way we approached it was to be as spontaneous and organic as possible, says McTavish. ldquoWe certainly didnrsquot want to come across as lecturing anybody about the history and landscape and world of Scotland. It was driven by our own enthusiasm for all of the places and people we encountered.ldquoWith the audience, as long as they feel that theyrsquore with us, as part of the journey, then our job was done. What we wanted to impart,anything, was the sense of us all going together and discovering all this stuff.:Outlander star Sam Heughan shares his favourite place in ScotlandHeughan agrees with this summary. ldquoBecause of lockdown and travel restrictions, people have started to rediscover this beautul country, he says. ldquoWe were among the first people to shoot in Scotland after the first lockdown.ldquoIt came out of us having almost a love letter to Scotland. We wanted to share it with the rest of the world. I hope when people in the UK watch it as well, they realise what is on their doorstep.The timing of Men In Kilts is serendipitous. As restrictions ease further and many Scots contemplate a summer break on home turf, it offers plenty of inspiration. If Heughan and McTavish could go anywhere right now ndash with no work ties or commitments ndash where would it be and why ldquoSomewhere I would love to go and have never been is the Applecross peninsula, says McTavish. ldquoAt one point we were thinking of cycling up that hill [Bealach na Ba].

Did they have a favourite steed ldquoThe campervan for me, says McTavish. ldquoIt was the most comfortable. It had heat. You werenrsquot getting blasted [by the elements], and your backside wasnrsquot being ruined by a piece of ironmongery that masqueraded as a bike.Heughan lays his cards on the table. ldquoTo be honest, the real premise of the show was for me to try find ways to put Graham McTavish in uncomfortable situations and I did try to find other means of transport and other ridiculous things to make him do.ldquoHe did refuse point blank to do some.

What  did they learn ldquoI learned of Samrsquos ability to hide whisky all about his person, says McTavish. ldquoI have no idea how he managed it sometimes. I think he actually had some in his wetsuit when we were surfing. It was just incredible how you managed to secrete it.Heughan plays along. ldquoIt was to keep me warm, he says. ldquoYou pour it down the wetsuit. It keeps you warm. Saves you peeing yourself.McTavish doesnrsquot even bat an eyelid at that last quip. ldquoWhatever the situation, Sam would be able to celebrate it with a dram, he attests. ldquoThat was always quite lovely for him to surprise me with. He would just suddenly pop out a flask.Heughan, meanwhile, is clearly in his happy place talking about whisky. ldquoIt is such a strong part of Scottish heritage and culture, he says. ldquoThat was interesting to dig into. Even going back to the historical side with the illicit stills. It is synonymous with Scotland, so why not celebrate it Something I am keen to ask them about is the notion of ldquoScottish cringe, a term used to describe embarrassment at overt expressions of national pride or cultural identity.

Certainly, for my fatherrsquos generation, it was hard. You were often the butt of jokesyou were from Scotland. But not anymore.Heughan is in fervent agreement. ldquoAbsolutely. I think it is the reason I wanted to make the show, he says. ldquoSomething I noticed working on Outlander was obviously this huge lsquoOutlander effectrsquo of people being interested in Scotland and Scottish history.ldquoI remember when I was growing up there was [this idea of] a very dour Scotsman. It was dreich and dark, and we Scottish people put ourselves down ndash or used to.ldquoThere is this new positivity and, dare I say, itrsquos because of a strong identity and because we are a great little country and we have so much to celebrate. We are showing other parts of the UK how things should be done, maybe. It is certainly interesting.Over the series, they cover a lot of ground. Culloden, though, gets a big standalone episode to itself. This, says McTavish and Heughan, was something they felt passionately about.ldquoIt is a pivotal moment, not just in Scottish history but British history and arguably world history, says McTavish. ldquoYou see the ramications of Culloden.

Going to Culloden and having Iain MacGillivray play the pipes on the battlefield ndash those were standout moments for me.Heughan says they wanted to challenge some of the myths about the Culloden story. ldquoIt is a battle that most Scottish people have heard about, but they probably think the Scots got beaten by lsquothe Englishrsquo or the British, he says.ldquoAs Graham says, it was this huge pivotal moment that had repercussions all around the world. It is a fascinating story and one we wanted to tell.McTavish is warming to his subject. ldquoI think as well that Culloden represents somewhat of the distillation of the myth and romanticism of Scotland, which I was interested in exploring, he continues.ldquoBecause when Sam says the Scots and lsquothe Englishrsquo in inverted commas, of course, the reality was not that at all. It was Scots against Scots.ldquoThere were more Scots on the British side than there were on the Jacobite side. So, it is important, when you look at history, that you look at it and see what really happened ndash not just what you would like to have happened.\"That is something I think that we both learned about.

It can, though, produce much of interest.My eye alighted ndash the other one was guarding against any potential theft of my tattle scone ndash on a brief account of Australian miners threatening strike action against their employers. The matter of dispute was how much, or little, they could drink when working in remote mines. The company limit was two pints a day.This cocktail of union disputes and drink carried me back to the swhen newspapers were bedevilled by the former and drenched in the latter. Both have disappeared from newspapers, and most workplaces, in the millennium.:Hugh MacDonald: At last, Ive discovered the joy of tellyThe consumption of drink was heroic in scaleregularly calamitous in consequence. It is dficult to convey now a genuine sense of the ubiquity of drink and drunks in that era. I am not pointing a finger, for in doing so four would be pointing at me, but a couple of observations may serve to indicate the way we were.There is a hesitation in all of this because, first, a mate is compiling a history of a particular, celebrated newspaper pub and one doesnrsquot want to nick his best tales, but there are more than enough to go round.Second, there is laughter in drink but in newspapers it could be the soundtrack to impending doom much in the same style as the theme music to Jaws. Drink lubricated the throat, initially eased the nerves, gave a feeling of bravado in the face of chronicling tragedies but ultimately took its toll on the imbibers.The haven for refuelling for this paper back in the last century was a shoap called McEnteersquos, Tomrsquos or the Press Bar. Its original licence holder was Tom McEntee and it was subsequently administered by his sons, grandsons and granddaughters.They ran the perfect pub.It was, back in the day, as lucrative as the Mr Whippy concession in the Sahara desert. It had a tick book. To the uninitiated, this book chronicled the precise credit which had been accepted by punters. In the s it was conservatively judged as more valuable than the Book of Kells.:Hugh MacDonald: George Square was a howl of rage but it may also be a cry for helpThe second illustrative observation would be to tell the story of one my cohorts on the subbing desk. He regularly cashed cheques in the bar, made out to T McEntee. Such was the regularity of these transactions that he was once called for a personal interview with his bank manager who asked him with some concern: ldquoWho is T McEntee and why is he blackmailing you The presence of strong unions undoubtedly played a part in the existence and weary acceptance, by management, of this way of le. There is a narrative now that these working practices led to the financial problems that beset papers. They did not. They were not big, they were not particularly smart but newspapers in their physical form were battered by the internet, not drink or drinkers.The unions, too, held a power that was devastating. There were a iety of unions in the building and the non co-operation of just one could mean that no newspaper was produced while salaries had to be paid in full to the other union members.It led to a wary appreciation of the management of the rights of the worker and it produced excellent conditions and salaries.:Hugh MacDonald: Across the water and back to the past, the journey that leads me to childhoodThis all stumbled along nicely and mostly lucratively for employer and employee until Wapping in  when unions were crushed by Rupert Murdoch. The print unions went the way of the Allied Association of Mammoth Shearers. Other unions were reduced to mere conduits for grievance but with little power.This has left the st century world of media in an ironic spot. Drinking at work is negligible. So it is much more healthy. But stress in all industries in the st century is high because of the reality of job insecurity, constant change and a succession of UK governments that have legislated against workersrsquo rights.The one measurable certainty is that journalists, at least, are living longer. At a dinner party in the s, I encountered an actuary. Itrsquos not as exciting as it sounds.But when I mentioned I had no idea about my possible pension, he replied blithely that it did not matter because I would not live to pick it up.

It was a sobering story for hundreds of thousands who have lost relatives during the pandemic, or seen their livelihoods destroyed.This is, however, only the version of a man sacked by the PM. Many lining up to proclaim him as some kind of whistleblowing figure were enjoining us, just weeks ago and just as enthusiastically, not to believe a word he said. Whatrsquos more, in terms of political impact, the attention given to his testimony by the media is not matched by the UK electorate as a whole: most have hardly heard of him of those who have, only  per cent take a favourable view.The success of the vaccine programme ndash the one unqualied success of the pandemic ndash and the Conservativesrsquo double-digit lead in the polls tends to confirm the theory that what matters most in a crisis is how you emerge from it, and that voters, as a mass, forgive and forget earlier errors.Thatrsquos something from which not only the Tory Government at Westminster, but the SNP Government at Holyrood ndash whose handling of the crisis is open to similar criticisms, though it has received fewer ndash have benefited.The vague impression of most who are not already committed opponents of Boris Johnson or Nicola Sturgeon is that eithermay have made mistakes but have done well in the face of unprecedented circumstances. Those attitudes are wildly dferent between Perth and Penrith.If there is one thing about which Mr Cummings ndash no matter how dim a view of him you take ndash is undoubtedly right, however, it is that those easy assumptions will not do. Not merely because of the implied affront to those who have suffered tremendous loss, nor,there have been failings, of properly holding people to account. What matters even more is that, unless we learn from episodes such as this, there can be no hope of doing any better in the future.We need to begin to examine, right now, the failures that have cost lives and livelihoods. Mr Cummings castigated Matt Hancock, Englandrsquos Health Secretary, for claiming people were released into care homes after an unfulfilled promise they would be tested first. If that is true, it is a scandal. But the Scottish Government might bear in mind that it released into care homes people it actually knew were positive.Mr Cummings lambasted the Westminster Cabinet for not having a plan, but that criticism was also directed at SAGE, Public Health England, the WHO, and the Civil Service, all of whom have now been shown to have made many serious errors, and whose advice he admits largely determined policy.An uncontested bit of his testimony is that advice against quarantine, lockdown and masks until late March last year came from scientists and public health advisers ministers followed scientic advice, and Holyrood, by and large, followed suit.Since the Scottish Government also followed ldquothe science, it raises uncomfortable questions about what is to be done when scientists and their advisory bodies dfer in approach and advice ndash as, in the very nature of science, they almost always do.The First Minister, like the Prime Minister, seems to have emerged with the publicrsquos general approval. Both owe that to their personal presentation, popularity and public perception, eventhose dfer sharply on either side of Hadrianrsquos Wall.Itrsquos an imperfect view. Worse, it isnrsquot enough, because it doesnrsquot identy the policy errors that might impede real progress. We need the inquiry to begin now, not to apportion blame, but to understand where we went wrong, and make sure we donrsquot slip on the road towards recovery."},{"url":null,"title":"brian-taylor-nicola-sturgeon-want-pact-greens-meets-eye","story":"Sometimes, as with his own West Lothian Question, he would opt for attrition, pursuing Ministers endlessly.However, I preferred his approach succinct.

Recalling my journalistic coaching, I asked: ldquoWho, what, when, where, why :Now Swinney has moved on, how will we sort out Scotlandrsquos struggling schools We know who: two parties, of dferent stature, supporting independence with ying degrees of fervour.We know what: a co-operation agreement short of full coalition. Eventually, there might be Green Ministers. For now, too soon.More to the point, the Greens stress they would reserve the right to dissent on certain specied issues. Which means no collective governmental responsibility. Which means no Ministers, for now.When  The talks are said to be at an early stage with months of discussion to come. Where  Holyrood.The big question, though, is why. One observer tells me that the Green co-leaders, Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater, seemed faintly taken aback at the initial ldquotalks about talks. Warily and sensibly, they stressed the need to consult colleagues.However, they have agreed to continue negotiating, noting en passant that they have secured concessions in recent Budget deals.There is history here. In , Alex Salmond led a minority administration. He tried to strike a partnership deal with the Liberal Democrats. That fell apart: key LibDems found the SNP and independence fundamentally unpalatable.Mr Salmond then turned to the Green MSPs. All two of them. The leader Robin Harper, with his permanent smile and Dr Who scarf. And Patrick Harvie, an astute politician even then.Again, a full partnership proved impossible, owing to a dispute over transport policy among other issues. A compact was signed to support the election of Mr Salmond as First Minister.That was not really needed: subsequent history proved that the party with the most MSPs would, in practice, be permitted by Parliament to enter office.They said they had been sold short. Mr Swinney was, to put it mildly, less than pleased. That memory no doubt lingers in the mind of the Deputy First Minister as he contemplates the new round of talks.So, again, why  Especially now, when the SNP are just one short of an overall majority in Holyrood.I sought answers from my Herald Podcast  among the number, Kezia Dugdale, who formerly led Labour and now heads the John Smith Centre. She disclosed that she had conducted extensive research, including a phone call to a pal in New Zealand, where there has been cross-party co-operation.She was advised that the Greens there felt they gained clout and influence. Labour leaders felt they gained extra security, including a pact which obviated the need for tense annual Budget talks.:Is independence inevitable or can unionists rescue the realm they cherish The deal has persisted, even though Labour won a majority last year. Some Greens are discontented.Scottish Green sources point to the New Zealand model, stressing the capacity to criticise the administration. They are less enthusiastic about the example of Ireland where some Greens fear their ideology risks being swamped in a compact with centre-right parties.Either way, it is, partly, about money. Nicola Sturgeon and Kate Forbes want to pre-empt the annual agony of Budgetary negotiations by securing potential support in advance.Not an easy sell. SNP Ministers are adamant they will stick to an income tax freeze for the duration of this Parliament. Greens favour a more radical approach to revenue, as they would see it, including a possible wealth taxa way could be found.But compromise could be reached. There will be other obstacles, such as Green opposition to road building. The FM said this week that dualling the A, for example, will not be halted.Then there is the North Sea. The parties dfer over the pace of shting away from oil and gas. With the COP  UN climate conference due in Glasgow, the SNP may be ready to give yet more ground, while protecting north-east jobs.Always, of course, there is independence. Would a compact add more impetus to the case for indyref  Not, I suspect, in terms of influencing the UK Government. But it would perhaps be a reminder of the ersity of support for independence.There is, however, a third motivation, beyond cash and indyref. The SNP have been in power for  years. The previous Holyrood session had a toxic tang: Brexit independence arguments and Nicola Sturgeon gazing fretfully over her shoulder at her ever-present predecessor.I believe the FM wants a fresh approach. Literally, a new politics. Sceptics will say this is purely about presentation. I think it is also strategic. By making a choice, by making a new alliance, Ms Sturgeon hopes to banish staleness from her own party, and simultaneously challenge rivals to refresh.She hopes, in so doing, to isolate the Tories. They respond by warning that the Greens will push her in an anti-business direction.She hopes, also, to challenge Labour, over policy and indyref. Anas Sarwar was, understandably, ill-prepared. His first response was simply to revive an old Labour theme, deriding the recreation of a spending cuts coalition.He will need a new tone, new phrases.

She also stated that about , care home deaths in England were not put down to Covid, but clearly were.To date, there is no evidence that hospital discharges led to a spike in care home deaths as opposed to transmission by asymptomatic agency staff and the failure to isolate residents who had caught the virus. Also, the size of the care home was more of an indicator of outbreak risk than hospital discharges, which were ultimately decisions taken by clinicians and home care managers in the best interest of patients.Mary Thomas, Edinburgh.THE ART OF DEFLECTIONTHERE seems to be little that anyone can teach Nicola Sturgeon in the art of deflective politics at a time when her Government is under fire for failures in the notication of Covid appointments and lacking candour over the deaths of children in hospital.As always Boris Johnson is an easy target and while her allegations that he dithered at the start of the pandemic leading to the unnecessary loss of lives may have some merit , she seems to forget that her own Government sanctioned the quick release of untested and infected elderly Covid patients from hospitals into care homes, resulting in a massive number of deaths. In this unprecedented situation which faced the UK and even the world, there are many things which could have been done better, but nitpicking at particular elements of the countrys Covid response in an attempt to cover up ones own failures doesnt help anyone.Bob MacDougall, Kippen.HOLD SNP TO THE SAME STANDARDSPETER Russellcalls for a \"plague on both their houses\" while castigating Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon for their catastrophic failures over Covid.The animosity and bickering poisoning intergovernmental relationships, to which he refers, is an unintendedoutcome of devolution.There is clearly no easy solution to such a situation while the fault line of secession continues to fragment Scottish politics.However, in the interests of even-handedness I hope that now that Dominic Cummings has pressed the nuclear button on what he perceives as the chaotic shambles in Westminster no time will be lost in subjecting the equivalent shambles in Scotlandto an equivalent degree of critical analysis. Mr Cummings commented en passant on similar Scottish policy delinquency to that of Westminster.If the Scottish Government seeks equivalence with its despised UK counterpart it should be held to the same standards of public scrutiny.I am having trouble holding my breath on this last point ... an affliction which is only indirectly related to Covid. Douglas Pitt, Newton Mearns.LABOUR MISSING AN OPPORTUNITYBILL Brownonce again parades his hatred of the SNP and contempt for the democratic wishes of the Scottish nation. He offers no explanation of how the SNP or any other party would be able to exercise total power in a democratically-elected independent Scottish parliament. I am at a loss to understand why Scottish Labour in particular appears to see no opportunity for itself as a strong contender to win power in an independent Scotland.It is this head-in-the-sand attitude which has caused so many of its previous supporters to defect to the SNP. If Anas Sarwar could bring himself to face reality rather than using the excuse of Covid recovery to justy fence-sitting on the independence issue he, and Mr Brown, might be pleasantly surprised at the public response.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.ROYALTY SHOULD STAY OUT OF POLITICSTHE recent foray of the Earl of Strathearn into the murky and emotional waters of constitutional politics north of the Border raises some very intriguing points.First, who is advising William at the moment  One would be forgiven for thinking that, following the Queenrsquos untimely intervention during the referendum on independence, his minders themselves would have intervened to stop it instead of clearly facilitating a leak.This was the beginning of a dark charm offensive by the unionists in advance of a possible second referendum. Such a referendum clearly has the air of inevitability about it, given Gordon Brown has come out of hibernation in his search for political relevancy. But theres also a very intriguing point here.As I understand it, and as we are frequently informed, the House of Windsor is supposed to stay out of partisan politics. That should have been enough reason to put the mockers on William and Gordonrsquos tecircte-agrave-tecircte. One could therefore ask with good reason: ldquoWell what about the unelected second chamber  Like the monarchy it is unelected with members being there either by accident of birth, religious affiliation or by being appointed by the will of politicians. I contend that neither the monarchy and those who represent that institution nor an unelected second chamber should be in a position to intervene in the running of the country.Rev John Nugent, Wick.OIL COMPANIES SHOULD HIT BACKA NETHERLANDS court has ruled that Shell must drastically cut its CO emissions by  . Other European countries are considering following suit.The worlds oil and gas companies should immediately declare that they will suspend all sales of oil and gas to any country that does likewise, then those countries will achieve net zero even quicker than they thought. Ill leave it to the reader to imagine the consequences.Geoff Moore, Alness.THIS WAS TORTURE, NOT OPERAI SHOULD be surprisedreader Tina Oakes , who professes disdain for English opera, dislikes the th century operas of Henry Purcell, especially Dido and Aeneas.The paying public in London and Dublin preferred oratorio to opera when Handel moved from Italy, where he had written exquisite Italian opera. The theme tune of the prosperous classes was Handelrsquos Messiah for the next three centuries.In Italy meanwhile, opera is the passion of humble and exalted folk alike from those days to these, with crowds in the street singing Verdirsquos Va, pensiero at his funeral.Ms Oakes is right about Gilbert and Sullivan. It is torture, not opera. But it was written as music hall with a dash of satire.There are even people who think Broadway musicals are opera, but that is not so.The th century wasnrsquot kind to serious music, especially not in English-speaking countries. Everyone had to pretend they liked academic work with no tunes, even when it was meant to be opera. James MacMillan I can tolerate, Harrison Birtwistle a bit, Britten not at all.Tim Cox, Bern, Switzerland.PAISLEYS LOST PARADISETHE Remember When... contribution by Russell Leadbetter concerning Sugar Ray Robinson in an exhibition boxing bout in Paisley in brought back many memories for me of the exciting times to be had at Paisley Ice Rink, alas no more.I remember the busy nights in the east end of Paisley as crowds made their way to see the ice hockey involving the Paisley Pirates. The Ice Rink, which could cope with , spectators, provided accommodation for many other attractions, such as exhibition tennis matches with players such as Rod Laver and Lew Hoad, and in  Muhammed Ali, billed as Cassius Clay, the world heavyweight champion, also appeared in an exhibition match. And not to be overlooked are the Humpty Dumpty and Cinderella pantomimes.All that is behind us now, but those were the days.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.SHOOT, WHICH IS IT R RUSSELL Smithwill be aware of Lynne Trusss book \"The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation\" and its sub-title \"Eats, Shoots and Leaves\".Or should that be \"Eats Shoots and Leaves\" David Miller, Milngavie.Read more: Is there anyone brave enough to be Scotlands Dominic Cummings "},{"url":null,"title":"us-woman-condemns-profiteering-home-office-5-month-visa-delays","story":"Victoria Abercrombie, a classroom assistant, has been waiting for almost six months for a visa after marrying her Scottish husband in December.However despite paying almost pound, for applications to live in the UK, the -year-old from Oregon told of how she was repeatedly fobbed off by Priti Patelrsquos department ndash until the Herald stepped in.:Kenmure Street: Home Office vows to deport Indian men freed from Glasgow dawn raidThe usual turnaround time for a spouse visa is eight weeks, however Mrs Abercrombie was waiting for  before the Herald contacted the Home Office last night.She paid out pound to gain her spouse visa, and pound for a fianceacutee visa to join her now-husband David Abercrombie in South Lanarkshire in August.While waiting, Mrs Abercrombie has been unable to work, and could not receive any medical treatment without having to pay extortionate fees, despite living in Scotland.She was also unable to leave the country, even when restrictions allow, as it would automatically have cancelled her application.She said: ldquoThe whole process has been completely awful. I canrsquot work, I havenrsquot seen my family and evenI was able to travel, I wouldnrsquot be allowed to because it would just cancel out my visa.ldquoIrsquom completely in limbo with this, and it seems like a completely unfair system.ldquoIf I got sick, I wouldnrsquot be able to afford the costs of healthcare because it would be thousands of pounds, butI had my spouse visa, which Irsquom entitled to, I wouldnrsquot have to pay for that.

Theyrsquove not been able to give me a timeframe as to when it will be, and how long I have to wait.

UK ministers queued to be interviewed on BBC Breakfast where a cuddle and a hot cup of tea awaited while the other side was boycotted for its disrespectful line of questioning.We were invited to recoil at how quickly the infrastructures of less civilised nations were crumbling.And yet, as Mr Cummings revealed in eye-watering detail on Wednesday, the UK Governmentrsquos critical response unit resembled feeding time at the zoo. Three months after initial reports of a lethal pandemic on the loose our Prime Minister was so dismissive of the threat he wanted to get publicly infected by it.Herd immunity, as Mr Cummings revealed, really was the chosen policy in those crucial early weeks, despite the fact that public health experts were all warning that pursuing this without a vaccine had never been used to deal with infectious diseases.The UK Government still insists it was only following the science. Perhaps they were, but they seem to have been using the Eric Morecambe approach: playing all the right notes but not necessarily in the right order.Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at Edinburgh University, dismantled this approach yesterday. ldquoThe reliance on complex theoretical modelling over the principles of basic infectious disease prevention was a problem so was groupthink within Sage [Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies]As Mr Cummings continued to take his flame-thrower to the administration hersquod helped into power you could predict the means by which his targets would defend themselves. This was all about revenge, they insisted. ldquoWe all knew he was a bit of an oddball, so really, therersquos nothing to see here.:Fidelma Cook: Scotland didnt vote for Johnson and Patel ndash so do something about itThat all of his conscripted detractors were only there because of Mr Cummingsrsquo dark genius seemed incidental. In the last five years this ldquooddball had orchestrated an unlikely Brexit triumph before securing a comfortable electoral majority for its chief proponents. His attention to detail and knack for reading the runes in places that had never previously registered on the Toriesrsquo collective SatNav have made this party virtually unassailable in England. Yet, within a year the people who benefited from his intellect and instincts are insisting hersquos an unreliable witness. Aye, right.Some of the Prime Ministerrsquos defenders compared his coronavirus ordeal to the challenge faced by Winston Churchill at the start of the Second World War. ldquoLook, the PMrsquos done well in the circumstances. This though, doesnrsquot bear much scrutiny either. Arguably, Britain, facing conquest, slaughter, and enslavement from the greatest military force since the Romans started the war from a much weaker position than the modern, affluent, technologically advanced state that had been given due warning about this pandemic.Of course, some things remain unchanged since . Britain is still run by a tiny, upper-class, elite drawn almost exclusively from a handful of select finishing schools and Oxfordrsquos aristocratic drinking-clubs. The problem in , though, is that in those sepia-remembered days  years ago at least it was an elite that included some quality.These people ndash the Hancocks the Williamsons the Rees-Moggs ndash are the dreck: only there because of their slavish devotion to Brexit. They have built a sordid little mafia industry on the side, ever eager to exploit the pandemic for their own personal enrichment.As Matt Hancock got into his ministerial car on Thursday morning, he was wearing a Union Jack face-mask, this being the establishmentrsquos chosen mot of defiance throughout the pandemic. Itrsquos deployed shamelessly to bend Englandrsquos working-class communities to their will while spinning lines about togetherness and remaining steadfast ndash just like Winston. Amidst it all, the royal family are expected to earn their keep.To carry it off they need the acquiescence of those in the Labour Party who have made their fortunes posing as champions of the people. What do you think that off-the-books meeting between Prince William and Gordon Brown was all about last week The Scottish Government may yet have its own questions to answer and not just those about its early strategy around care homes. Unlike Boris Johnson, our First Minister maintains closer control of those she permits to be inside her very small tent. You wonrsquot find any whistleblowers at Bute House. Yesterday, she consigned Glasgow to yet another week in punitive, Level Three lockdown restrictions. The city is home to some of the most intense concentrations of multi-deprivation in Europe, a critical factor in the stubbornly high case numbers.: Kevin McKenna: Cummings statements reveal Covid- response was shambolicGlaswegians will grumble, but continue to hunker down, trusting that Nicola Sturgeon is doing it for the best. This trust comes with a caveat though. For, when Holyrood seeks to plot Scotlandrsquos Covid recovery, at its heart there must be a preferential option for Glasgow. The metropolitan city-region of Glasgow accounts for almost a third of Scotlandrsquos population and these communities will be hit hardest by the job losses and leline service cuts to come.The physical and mental scarring theyrsquoll experience will deserve special attention. The Scottish Government could signal its commitment to addressing this by establishing a Minister for Glasgow with full cabinet responsibility.

These have included its County Antrim congregations in its Route, Ballymena, Carrickfergus and Templepatrick presbyteries. Called ‘Fanning the flame’, the initiative is part of PCI’s Refined series of resources that it has developed throughout the pandemic to support and develop ongoing congregational le. Explaining the rationale for the series, Rev David Thompson, Secretary for the Council for Congregational Le and Witness , who organised the sessions, said that it was important for congregations to retain flexibility for the road ahead.“Since the start of the pandemic, it has been an extraordinarily dficult time for everyone. “For our congregations in Northern Ireland, it has been a very stop – start journey. “Thankfully it does feel like we are turning a corner and entering a moment of greater hope, optimism and opportunity, but it won’t be without its challenges.”The title for the series comes from  Timothy :-, which says, “For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gt of God [...] For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline. Key leaders from each congregation in Northern Ireland, including those across County Antrim, were encouraged to participate.David Thompson said that he was pleased that each presbytery has responded positively to the Moderator’s invitation to be part of the programme. “Timing is key in building progress and trying to do so too early may lead to frustration. “Leaving it too late, may mean we miss an important moment. This is why we began with our northern presbyteries this month, with events for congregations in our southern presbyteries taking place in June, which seems about right given their setting and circumstances,” David Thompson said.Running the events has involved a signicant leap of faith and rapid learning by staff in how to harness the potential of digital technology and presentation. Lynne Herbison’ PCI’s Programme Development Officer added, “The team involved have learned a lot and those new skills will be invaluable in opening up a world of possibility in how we can now engage with congregations and their members in the future. “Nothing compares to being physically together, but we hope our digital  will be able to supplement that and improve the reach of what we can offer to our churches and their members.”Presbyterian Moderator, Right Reverend Dr David Bruce, who took part in the events, said, “This has been a massive undertaking, delivered in a very short window so as not to miss this crucial moment as we continue to turn this long awaited corner.“ I really want to commend everyone who has made this important series possible.“We have been through exceptionally challenging times and I don’t want to minimise that and the suffering that this pandemic has caused. In my contributions to each event, looking at how congregations can begin to move forward, I tried to convey a sense that change often forces reinvention and reconsideration, opening up new pathways and patterns that overlay the old familiar foundations of church le that we cherish. “Exploring this, I am looking forward to welcoming our Republic of Ireland presbyteries to ‘Fanning the Flame’ in June.” he said.Dr Bruce concluded by saying, “In the long history of God’s people there have been many times like the months we have experienced, and in those dark days God was at work, and He is today. “It is my earnest prayer that we will see tangible signs of His leading, so that we can press on with confidence into this new beginning.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1622208073289.jpg--covid_19___fri_28th_may_figures.jpg?1622208073000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20210528newscovid 19 fri 28th may figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows No further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

Destinations include Portugal, Israel, Iceland, Australia and New Zealand.However, today’s poll reveals many are still deeply reluctant to hop on a plane abroad any time soon.People were asked, once vaccinated, when they would consider a foreign holiday.Just % said they plan to head away in  — % may travel this summer while another % would consider an overseas trip later in the year.The vast majority , said it would be next year before they think about going abroad.Another % said it would be two or three years before a trip outside the UK or Ireland, while % have no plans to go overseas at any point.The remaining % were unsure or had no firm opinion.Fewer older people are willing to consider overseas travel this year. Just % would consider doing so — % this summer and % at any point this year. More than halfsaid it would be next year before they consider jetting off, while % would leave it two or three years.By contrast, almost halfof  to  year olds are considering heading overseas this year — with % hoping to get away in the next few months and % later in the year. Another % will leave it to . Broken down by gender, males of any age are more willing to take a trip abroad — % plan to do so this summer and a further % will at some point in . Another % said it would be next year.However, just over a quarter of females plan to holiday abroad in  — % this summer and % this year. Some % plan to leave trips to .It comes as a public health expert from Belfast warned against summer holidays — despite the traffic light system for foreign travel.Professor Gabriel Scally told holidaymakers to “beware” and also warned it is “irresponsible” to travel to other countries while potentially infected with a dangerous iant.Prof Scally, a member of independent Sage, said: “The regional director of the World Health Organization in Europe issued a statement in the last couple of days saying there shouldn’t be international travel and I would agree with that.“It is undesirable to have people holidaying in international resorts at this time for all sorts of reasons.“It isn’t necessarily safe to travel on airplanes, there was a flight between India and Hong Kong and there were  infections and they were only picked up because of quarantine in Hong Kong.“Flights are dficult, but it isn’t just the flights, it’s what happens at arrivals and departures with queues of people in restricted spaces.“You also have lots of people from dferent countries mixing together at foreign resorts.“If you think back a year, the virus came to the UK and Republic of Ireland by people ing from holidays.”He continued: “It’s important to remember that the vaccine isn’t the cure all.“There’s always the risk posed by iants and it’s irresponsible to go off to another country and potentially take a dangerous iant with you.”Prof Scally also criticised the traffic light system, saying: “We need a proper managed quarantine system for everyone arriving into the country.”The Department of Health and the Executive were contacted for comment.Yesterday an airline industry chief said people who have received both doses of the Covid- vaccine should not face restrictions when travelling to countries on the Government’s amber list.Willie Walsh, director-general of airline body Iata, said people should be allowed to make up their own minds about the risks of travelling to amber list destinationsthey have received their jabs.Those ing from countries on the Government’s amber list must quarantine at home for  days and take pre-departure and post-arrival tests.But Mr Walsh, who is the former chief executive of IAG — the parent company of British Airways — said amber restrictions should be the same as those for green list countries for fully vaccinated passengers.He told the Mail on Sunday: “People were promised the benefit of being vaccinated — a vaccine idend — and they should be given it.“I thinkyou’ve had both shots then there’s no argument you can make to say those restrictions can remain in place, and people should be free to decide for themselvesthey see any risk in travelling to a green or amber country,” the former IAG chief executive added.Most ReadPolice probing UDA threats claim as split in DUP deepensMajestic Hillsborough mansion has it all‘No-shows’ add to restaurant owner’s woeNorthern Ireland churches are not welcoming, say half of survey respondentsCottage le offers chance to own some local historyTop VideosPlayDUP turmoil: Poots insists party isn#t idedPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#Play graves damaged in Newtownabbey cemetery Latest CoronavirusGreen light for cross-border breaks as Republic reopensMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageCoronavirus QA: Everything you need to know as vaccination programme opens to all adultsNearly  payments issued under £k Covid grant scheme ineligibleCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No deaths, fewer than  cases and vaccine programme extendedLatestThomas Tuchel hopes Champions League win will earn him a new Cha contractBen Cushnie hailed as #something special# after debut goal for GlentoranDavid Jeffrey #frustrated# and #encouraged# as Ballymena United push Glenavon all the way for play-off place#The best week of my le#: Andy Waterworth reacts to final Linfield goal ahead of Gibson Cup presentation at SolitudeBoris Johnson marries Carrie Symonds in secret ceremony,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurney PAAndrew MaddenTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailMore than half of people in Northern Ireland believe parents should have the right to refuse a Covid vaccine for their children, our poll shows.The news comes after Northern Ireland’s vaccine roll-out opened to those aged  to  and a raft of Covid restrictions are lted from Monday.“This has been made possible because of the success of the vaccination programme and the majority of people acting on the public health advice,” Health Minister Robin Swann said.According to the Belfast -LucidTalk poll, % of respondents felt parents should be able to refuse a vaccine for their children, while % felt they should not and % said they did not know, were not sure or had no opinion.The figures, however, y depending on the age and religious make-up of those who took part in the poll.Regarding  to  year-olds, a majorityfelt parents should not be able to turn down a vaccine for their children, while % felt they should and % didn’t know or had no opinion.Those aged  to , on the other hand, had starkly contrasting views. Some % said parents should be able to refuse a vaccine for their children and % said they should not. And % said they didn’t know, were unsure or had no opinion.Vaccines may be refused for a iety of reasons. For instance, earlier this year several countries temporarily halted the roll-out of the AstraZeneca jab due to concerns of rare blood clots.Due to evidence suggesting that younger people may be at greater risk of the extremely rare clots associated with the AstaZeneca vaccine, those in this age group can choose which vaccine to receive.The latest advice states that anyone under  can book a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, or they can make what the Department of Health has described as an “informed decision” and get the AstraZeneca jab at Belfast’s SSE Arena or at participating community pharmacies.More than one million people in Northern Ireland have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine to date.Looking at the religious make-up of those who took part in the poll, it is apparent that Protestants are more likely to feel parents should have a say over vaccinating their children than when compared to Catholics.Some % of Protestant respondents felt this way, while % felt they should not have the right to turn down a jab for their children and % had no opinion, were not sure or didn’t know.Of those designating as Catholic, % felt they should have the right to turn down a vaccine for their children and % did not. The remaining % said they didn’t know or were unsure.In terms of those of no religion, % were in favour of parents having this right and % did not. Some % weren’t sure or had no opinion on the matter.On Sunday the Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride urged everyone to get vaccinated. He said: “A Public Health England study has found the vaccines are highly effective.

Stock image FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNearly % believe that the churches and faith communities hold views that limit their ability to help those struggling with mental health and wellbeing. Stock imageAlf McCrearyEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailMore than half of people questioned for a report on mental health have claimed that the churches in Northern Ireland are not places of genuine welcome.Nearly % believe that the churches and faith communities hold views that limit their ability to help those struggling with mental health and wellbeing.However, all respondents felt that the churches did have an important role to play in promoting good mental health.Dr Andrew Cunning, director of the Christian organisation Left Side Up which produced its “Call to Action” report, said: Our publication is designed to challenge the church while equipping and supporting it to do even better in the areas of mental health and wellbeing. In it we spent time in looking at the Bible, the issue of welcome, toxic theologies and alternative spiritual practices.”Almost  people across Northern Ireland were surveyed, including Presbyterians, Anglicans, Baptists, Methodists, Catholics and members of the Vineyard Church.Three-quarters of these were women, % are leaders in the churches and faith communities, % are heterosexual and % are LGBT. Ages range from  to .Some % said they have been diagnosed with a mental health issue and % believe that they have an undiagnosed mental health issue or illness.Meanwhile, % believe mental health is connected to faith, while % have questioned their faith because of mental ill-health.Also in the survey, % of people believed that the churches need to encourage open conversation about mental health and wellbeing.Some iniduals believe that the churches have made a positive contribution. One said: “There are many within the church community who are kind, generous and good listeners.”Another said: People in my church community care for each other and try to support each other’s wellbeing.”Overall, however, % of the respondents in the survey say that they have experienced the Bible being used in a way that is damaging to mental health, and % “have found other spiritual practices outside of church that are helpful for their mental health and wellbeing.”The report lists some “toxic theology “ situations, including the claim that “suicide is a sin”, as well as “Medication and treatment are the opposite to faith” and “your faith is too weak, otherwise you would be well.”It also refers to “a lack of providing solutions that aren’t in the Bible. The belief that everything is in ’God’s hands’ and to simply ‘pray away’ a situation is unhelpful when your mental health and circumstances do not change, in spite of praying and reading the Bible.”The report recommends providing pastoral care to people who suffer from mental health issues and encouraging them to seek help..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadPolice probing UDA threats claim as split in DUP deepensMajestic Hillsborough mansion has it all‘No-shows’ add to restaurant owner’s woeNorthern Ireland churches are not welcoming, say half of survey respondentsCottage le offers chance to own some local historyTop VideosPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#PlayDUP turmoil: Poots insists party isn#t idedPlay graves damaged in Newtownabbey cemetery Latest Northern IrelandFirst coronavirus death recorded in  daysNorthern Ireland traffic alerts: Annacloy Road, Downpatrick closed SDLP chief calls for action over north west’s ‘crumbling homes’Rainbow crossing: Mayor finds the finance for Derry projectGillian HallidayOpinionArlene Foster is looking like a metaphorical weight’s been lted off her shouldersLatestLetter written by ‘father of vaccines’ could sell for £,Hooked on a Feeling singer BJ Thomas dies at Thomas Tuchel hopes Champions League win will earn him a new Cha contractBen Cushnie hailed as #something special# after debut goal for GlentoranDavid Jeffrey #frustrated# and #encouraged# as Ballymena United push Glenavon all the way for play-off place,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Kelvin Boyes   Press EyeGillian HallidayTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailNorthern Ireland’s next First Minister must aim to find the “common ground” in the power-sharing Executive, Arlene Foster has said.Mrs Foster offered words of advice to her successor on what was her last day as DUP leader yesterday.Read MoreGillian Halliday:OpinionArlene Foster is looking like a metaphorical weight’s been lted off her shouldersOn her last official engagement of the day in Ballygally, Co Antrim, where she met with representatives of Larne Athletic Club, she said she hoped her successor was aware of the role’s demands.Paul Givan has been linked to the top job, with the other contender Mervyn Storey reportedly turning down the job.Mrs Foster told the Belfastthat whoever takes over faces a big task.“I would say to them... that it is a hugely rewarding job but a hugely challenging job,” she said. “And there’s a lot of searching for common ground when you’re First Minister because of course we’re in a five-party coalition. It isn’t a single party government and therefore there is that very great demand of trying to find the common ground for the good of everybody in Northern Ireland.“And I hope whoever is put in as First Minister, they recognise that it is absolutely a challenge but rewarding as well when what you’re doing is right for the people of Northern Ireland.”Earlier, she revealed during a visit to Banbridge Academy in Co Down that while she was set to remain First Minister until the end of June, she would leave earlynew DUP leader Edwin Poots removes her allies from office next week.Mr Poots could name a new set of ministers as early as Tuesday.Mrs Foster added: “I will resign as well because I have my ministerial team in the Executive with me, we have worked very closely together.“If Edwin decides that he wants to change that team, I will have to go as well because I can’t stay with a new ministerial team of which I have no authority, and that would be wrong.”She was, however, gracious in offering her well-wishes to Mr Poots, amid deepening isions within the DUP following accusations loyalist paramilitary intimidation tactics had been used against members of Sir Jeffrey Donaldson’s leadership campaign.“I’ve come to terms with the fact that I’m stepping down as leader, some weeks ago now,” she explained.“I’m wishing him well for the future. Obviously it’s time for me to move on and do dferent things. I’m not sure yet what that’ll be, but we’ll find out soon enough.”Asked by pupils at Banbridge Academyshe would recommend a career in politics, Mrs Foster said: Yes I would, without hesitation.Despite all the challenges, it is a hugely rewarding career. As well as representing my constituency, I have been able to represent Northern Ireland.That has been the greatest privilege of my le. To go to places and sell Northern Ireland as a place to invest in and a place to visit is a tremendous privilege.Mr Poots said he had no intention of forcing Mrs Foster out of office and she could remain until a time of her choosing.“That’s my position and that remains my position. I am not going to be rushed into doing anything or pushed into doing anything, nor am I going to be denied doing something that I am ready to do,” Mr Poots said.“We will look at all of these issues and take a decision at a time that is appropriate for us.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadPolice probing UDA threats claim as split in DUP deepensMajestic Hillsborough mansion has it all‘No-shows’ add to restaurant owner’s woeNorthern Ireland churches are not welcoming, say half of survey respondentsCottage le offers chance to own some local historyTop VideosPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#PlayDUP turmoil: Poots insists party isn#t idedPlay graves damaged in Newtownabbey cemetery Latest Northern IrelandFirst coronavirus death recorded in  daysNorthern Ireland traffic alerts: Annacloy Road, Downpatrick closed SDLP chief calls for action over north west’s ‘crumbling homes’Northern Ireland churches are not welcoming, say half of survey respondentsRainbow crossing: Mayor finds the finance for Derry projectLatestHooked on a Feeling singer BJ Thomas dies at Thomas Tuchel hopes Champions League win will earn him a new Cha contractBen Cushnie hailed as #something special# after debut goal for GlentoranDavid Jeffrey #frustrated# and #encouraged# as Ballymena United push Glenavon all the way for play-off place#The best week of my le#: Andy Waterworth reacts to final Linfield goal ahead of Gibson Cup presentation at Solitude,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueArlene Foster and Michelle O#Neill at the Strand Arts Centre.May   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailFrom the DUP in turmoil to MLAs needing Yoda#s wisdom, Andrew Madden and Gareth Cross take a closer look at some of the more unusual things in the Assembly and further afield this week.Monday: Outgoing First Minister Arlene Foster forgot her worries on Monday, with a trip to the cinema in east Belfast with deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill.The pair were snapped with large boxes of popcorn as they joined pensioners at the Strand Arts Centre, as coronavirus restrictions lted, for a showing of classic short films.During the visit Mrs Foster questioned the existence of a letter of no-confidence against her signed by DUP MLAs and MPs that led to her downfall. It#s now been nearly four weeks since I heard about it and I still haven#t seen it, she said.In the Assembly, Justice Minister Naomi Long told MLAs she saw no substantive reason for a judge-led review into the Bobby Storey funeral. Ms O#Neill said it was time to get on with rebuilding our economy rather than continuing to focus on the funeral of the former IRA member.New UUP leader Doug Beattie said issues around the funeral could affect the future of Stormont itselfnot addressed, warning of terminal decline”.A busy week for Edwin Poots began with him answering a question from Jim Allister about compensation for slaughtered animals. Mr Poots, in his written answer, revealed that in   his department paid £,, in compensation for animals slaughtered for disease control purposes. Of this, £,, related to bovine Tuberculosis £, related to avian influenza and £, for Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis.Tuesday: The Assembly debated Finance Minister Conor Murphy#s budget with MLAs highly critical.Finance Committee chair Steve Aiken said it was hard to scrutinise the budget given its limited granularity, occasional evasions and obfuscations from departments.SDLP MLA Matthew O#Toole criticised NHS waiting lists, saying we should be ashamed and the budget contained no plans to address his concerns.The DUP#s Paul Frew responded, saying it was refreshing to hear Luke Skywalker in the corner, although he did sound more like Chewbacca at times, he looks to a truth that we all need the wisdom of Yoda in times of stress like this”.Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon was also critical of new DUP leader#s Edwin Poots# refusal to attend meetings of north-south bodies saying it was hugely frustrating the meetings had been deliberately obstructed.TUV leader Jim Allister said he hoped Mr Poots would refuse to engage until the Northern Ireland Protocol was dismantled, saying it had trashed east-west relations. Later the new DUP leader said he remained committed to all his obligations, but north-south relations had never been worse.Arlene Foster continued to throw herself into events to forget her troubles during her final days as First Minister.During a visit to Brooklands Primary School in Dundonald she said: “Regardless of what’s happening where, a visit to a school never fails to lt my spirits. Meeting young people is always a humbling, but invigorating experience.Wednesday: Unionists were sacriced for the Northern Ireland Protocol, Westminster#s NI Affairs Committee heard.PUP Belfast councillor Dr John Kyle said nationalists and unionists had not been treated equally during the Brexit process.The identity and ethos of the unionist community, as equal citizens with everyone  in the United Kingdom, was sacriced, he said.Dr Kyle did accept the protocol may have some economic benefits, but added for many unionists being British is more important than being prosperous.In the Assembly the Education Committee heard evidence from the General Teaching Council for Northern Ireland .Chair Brendan Morgan revealed that in nine months’ time organisations in Northern Ireland would no longer have access to the EU safeguarding database which is used to for background checks on applicants as a result of Brexit.“Is Brexit is actually exposing our children to potential risk , Sinn Fein#s Pat Sheehan asked.“As of September , we will no longer have access to that database which screens professional teachers,” Mr Morgan explained.Thursday: What was supposed to be a formal ratication process for his leadership of the DUP turned into a nightmare for Edwin Poots.As new UUP leader Doug Beattie contentedly sipped a whiskey after being unanimously elected to lead his party, a DUP rubber stamping exercise laid the party#s isions bare for the world to see.While an attempt to hold a secret ballot to confirm Mr Poots# leadership was rejected, senior party figures including Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Gavin Robinson, Gregory Campbell and Diane Dodds walked out while he was making his acceptance speech.Outgoing leader Arlene Foster also left early, and as a waiting media asked her for information on what was happening inside, a cheerful Mrs Foster quipped you#ll soon find out and flashed a peace sign.Paul Bell, a member of the Fermanagh and South Tyrone DUP for over  years, emotionally quit and said the party would haemorrhage votes as a result of Mrs Foster#s treatment.The issue of nurses’ pay was back of the agenda. Alex Easton asked Health Minister Robin Swann, in an Assembly question, about plans for a pay rise in the coming year.Mr Swann responded: “The pay round for   for NHS and HSC staff has not yet been finalised. Any decision on a pay award for nurses and other NI health workers, will be taken after the pay review bodies make their recommendations..Mr Swann said he was “committed to a fair pay settlement for all our healthcare staff going forward”Friday: The fallout from the DUP#s leadership fiasco continued into Friday. After reports that Sir Jeffrey Donaldson told Thursday#s meeting that his campaign team had been subjected to threats and intimidation from the UDA, there were calls for a police investigation.Sinn Fein#s North Belfast MP John Finucane called the claims deeply disturbing.If true, this is a very worrying development that an armed, illegal organisation was involved in influencing the outcome of the leadership contest of the largest party in unionism and a party of government, he said.It represents an attempt to subvert the democratic process and that is totally unacceptable.Arlene Foster announced she would stand down from the role on Tuesdayher replacement Edwin Poots proceeds with an Executive reshuffle.She also had some advice for her successor: There are very many good people who vote for us, who support us but he needs to recognise there is a lot of work to do in terms of healing isions that are quite obviously there in the party..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadPolice probing UDA threats claim as split in DUP deepensMajestic Hillsborough mansion has it all‘No-shows’ add to restaurant owner’s woeNorthern Ireland churches are not welcoming, say half of survey respondentsCottage le offers chance to own some local historyTop VideosPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#PlayDUP turmoil: Poots insists party isn#t idedPlay graves damaged in Newtownabbey cemetery Latest PoliticsSearch for common ground for the good of NI: Arlene’s words of wisdom to successorPolice probing UDA threats claim as split in DUP deepensJon TongeOpinionThere’s no disloyalty in UUP ranks, but Beattie badly needs some new recruitsDepartment of Health cannot sanction Professor Ian Young despite public inquiry criticism Tributes as UUP veteran Olive Whitten dies following illnessLatestHooked on a Feeling singer BJ Thomas dies at Thomas Tuchel hopes Champions League win will earn him a new Cha contractBen Cushnie hailed as #something special# after debut goal for GlentoranDavid Jeffrey #frustrated# and #encouraged# as Ballymena United push Glenavon all the way for play-off place#The best week of my le#: Andy Waterworth reacts to final Linfield goal ahead of Gibson Cup presentation at Solitude,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

auction and are always of interest and this one is expected to fetch over £,,” said auctioneer Chris Albury.“To get one which concerns vaccination is ideal, but this letter also offers insights into Dr Jenner’s character and true feelings as he battled with the medical establishment while promoting his ideas.Mr Albury said Dr Jenner’s ideas were received enthusiastically in some quarters, but they were not universally accepted and there were strong anti-vaccination feelings, then as now, for a whole iety of reasons.“One can understand some of the anti-vaccination sceptics who were nonplussed by the idea of using cowpox pus to inoculate people against smallpox in terms of hygiene and its ‘unchristian’ practice coupled with distrust in medicine generally,” he said.“The more common practice at the time was to use smallpox itself to inoculate against the disease, but the risks were great with a mortality rate of % and the added danger of creating local outbreaks and more transmitters of the deadly disease.“Dr Jenner’s vaccination theories were proven right and by  the British government banned the use of iolation – the use of smallpox to induce immunity – and provided vaccination using cowpox free of charge.”The th century scientist discovered the vaccine for smallpox virus at his home in Berkeley, Gloucestershire.Dr Jenner built a one-room hut in his garden to

We’ve got some testing under our belt in the new car and it feels really good, but there’s nothing better than actual competition to see where you’re at. googletag.cmd.push Rally Poland will be a new event to me as it didn’t run last year so we are going to do Rally Žemaitija in Lithuania as a warm up beforehand to get up to speed. Last year’s ERC campaign didn’t get off to a good start but we finished well and I’m hoping to take that momentum into . It takes a lot of backing to mount a challenge at this level and I’m delighted to welcome some new partners on board this season including Parts For Cars, Lyons of Limerick, Rentokil Initial, Trailerstuff.ie and Fire Protection Ireland. Without them and existing backers like Curran Gate, Pirelli, TST Transport, EARS Motorsport, Marina Racewear and the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy, this season just wouldn’t be possible.” googletag.cmd.push The move to a Ford will see Callumto a brand he’s rallied with before and M-Sport will be keeping a watchful eye on Callum’s progress this season.“The European Rally Championship has long been a proving ground for young talent looking to make their mark on the world stage, and it’s great to see another young driver choosing to take this route with the Fiesta. saidM-Sport Managing Director, Malcolm Wilson OBE. We’ve been aware of Callum for a number of years now following strong performances with the Fiesta R in Junior WRC and Fiesta R in Ireland. He’s got talent, and I’m keen to see what he can do as he tackles some ofEurope’s most famous events with the Fiesta Rally.”     M-Sport Ford Team Principal, Richard Millener added: “It’s great to see Callum back behind the wheel of the Fiesta and I’m looking forward to seeing what he can do this year. He had a great season with the Fiesta in , finishing third overall in the Irish Tarmac Championship and securing his first victory in Donegal – and we’re all keen to see him carry those performances onto the European stage. He’s already completed one year at this level, and now that he’s reunited with the Fiesta we want to help him take that next step. He’s got the initial experience under his belt, and we will give him as much support as we can to allow him to excel. The competition will be strong, but Callum is a very determined and talented young driver with the potential to surprise a few people this year.” Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy driver Devine will be joined for his ERC adventure by co-driver James Fulton and the Championship will consist of eight rounds taking place in Poland, Latvia, Italy, the Czech Republic, the Azores, Portugal, Hungary and Gran Canarias.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He waves a cursory greeting and continues on his way. In the time it takes me to gather everything I need together, he passes me again, his step count no doubt rising with every lap of the town. Zoom. Walk. Laptop. Bake. Netflix. Repetition has become endemic over the last year, but its something Moneymore cant be accused of. There is a unique feel to the fronts of the buildings that greet me as I walk around the town. Even the post office, now boarded up, remains unbranded. googletag.cmd.push Moneymores terrain gives the town a layered effect. The pillared entrance of The Manor House provides the backdrop to the towns mini roundabout, welcoming motorists coming down the hill from Smith Street. Rusty scaffolding frames a construction site on my left as I make my way down. A woman waters potted plants in her compact front garden. The distinctive smell of curry is emanating from the two Chinese restaurants at the bottom of the hill. Shutters are down on Antonios pizza, yet to open for the day. More scaffolding sits alongside buildings in mid-construction off High Street, but no work appears to be going on today. googletag.cmd.push Along Lawford Street there are ersion signs in place as Council staff busy themselves in resurfacing the Turnaface Road. The grating sound of the road roller echoes off the houses that line the street leading back to the town centre. You could describe Moneymore as ornate. Older, unique buildings, set at dferent levels, create a layered backdrop, crowned by the spire of St John and St Treas church on the top of the hill.  The hum of a small aircraft passing overhead and the unmistakable smell of freshly-cut grass adds to the sense of a town taking new-found pleasure in the mundane.     A pregnant sky threatens rain. Taken a dip I nip into The Mane Barber Shop, where a neon sign declares the shop open for business. Owner Pauline McGarvey is at her lunch. She says reopening has not been the silver bullet the industry was hoping for. “This week has been terrible. For the first seven days [after reopening] it was great, but its taken a dip again,” she tells me. “The older folk that keep you going – your pensioners and farmers and that during the day – they havent been about the same. A vintage tractor model welcomes visitors to the town from the Tyrone side. “It was a gamble coming into a small town. You do have a bit of passing trade but youre hoping people are going to come in from the likes of Coagh, Lissan and Loup. “I said I would give it six months and see how it turns. Its fine, but its not busy. You have that fear of whether its going to come back.” Pauline has been in Moneymore three years, and until the pandemic ruthlessly attacked all businesses, things had been going well.  has seen a seismic change across all industries, driving many hair and beauty professionals off the high street altogether. “Lots of people are working from home and I have to admit, Im tempted,” she says. “Youre still going to be hit with rates, and you havent stopped paying your water bill, your electricity, your rent. “Yes, we got a bit of help, butyouve no customers in, then that money is all going to go and you still have to find wages too. “Ive seen a lot of hair and beauty people who havent gone back from the first lockdown.” Humanity adapts though, and over the last year, Pauline has embraced the situation in which the world found itself. She got married in February, and has enjoyed the extra time with her family. Keeping an eye on litter in the area. “It was the first time in my le I could actually say I was a mummy. I loved spending time with the weans,” she says. “It felt like wed a whole  years wrapped into one year. It is nice getting back though, you need the routine. Its bittersweet in a way.” Cookstown native Pauline says lockdown has really hit young people in the area hard. Her daughter, Danielle, is in Year , her entire GCSE years undertaken amid a worldwide health crisis. “Even she says she could do with another year at school,” she says. “Theyve missed a full year of preparation for the next step. Theyve been living alone in their bedroom. No formal, nothing. They werent even in school to plan it.” Its a quiet day in the barber shop, on what would normally be a busy Friday afternoon, with people popping in ahead of their weekend plans. There would have been excited chatter, the buzz of anticipation. Last minute changes of plan. Maybe even a wee drink. A look at her schedule confirms a gap of a few hours until Paulines next appointment. Without that steady flow of customers, the day can be long, lonely even. Welcome to Moneymore. Company is a two way street, and the dynamic of conversation, service and industry has been greatly missed by both barber and customer. “Even the most bald man that I have is in here every week,” says Pauline. “Two seconds would do it, but you would stretch it out to ten or  minutes, just because he likes coming in for the company. “Sometimes its just nice to get sitting down and get it done for you. Even though I have good faithful customers, I was nervous and jittery the first day back. “The amount of people who are saying its great to see you back, it gives you that wee glow. It would be nice to see a boom in Moneymore again. “I dont think anybody is going to feel anything dferent. Were all just going with the flow and trying not to stress and worry. “I think youre just going to have to wipe this year out the same as last year.”  The indicators that marked the early, panic-stricken days of the pandemic – the empty streets, closed schools, empty supermarket shelves – have long faded into memory. Only the window dressing remains. Sanitisers at shop doors. Face masks in shops. The odd discarded rubber glove on the street. All three car dealerships on the Magherafelt Road are dotted with customers as I drive past on the way home. The petrol station forecourt is hiving with people. By next Monday, theof indoor hospitality will mark another signicant step on the road to recovery. On the way out of the town, I spot a familiar cowboy hat bobbing up and down at the road side. A man enjoying his rediscovered freedom on the fringes of the Sperrins.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

After crossing the bridge, I head up the hill and pull the car in opposite the Vivo and the magnicently named Rio Grande bar. Parks Rio Grande, the Faughan River, flows through the centre of the village, which this afternoon sits under an angry-looking sky. A woman walks her dog down Learmount Road, her face set against the stf breeze that is swishing through the trees surrounding the village. The scene on Learmount Road leading up the hill. Rain starts to fall as a mother guides her toddler out the doors of the Vivo, one hand clutching hers and the other gripping the bottle of juice he has just been bought. googletag.cmd.push A large plastic ice cream cone sits hopefully outside the shop. Up the hill comes a learner driver seemingly on a lesson. She stops outside Learmount Resource Centre and disappears into the building, before emerging with her child in tow to resume her lesson. A delivery driver pulls into the yard of Devine Kitchens. He s to his cab and pulls out a hammer. Things must be getting serious. As I cross the bridge, I spot the wheel from an old watermill by the river side, almost reclaimed by its surroundings. A remnant of an  flax mill known as Quigleys Mill. googletag.cmd.push Perhaps the most clear view of the mill is from the top of the hill outside Park Hardware and DIY. Greg McElhinney and Matthew Devine. Inside, owner Greg McElhinney says the last year has been busy. “With construction and everything  closing down last April, we were very busy, which was good for us because people from the local area were able to do home projects,” he tells me. “The weather was good as well, so youd a lot of painting and decorating – fences and gardens and stuff like that – going on. “People were happy there was a local business still operating, because a lot of the bigger hardware stores had closed.     “It got to the stage when it was hard to source materials because suppliers were closed until June time, but people were happy enough to occupy their time. They had nothing  to do.” The remains of Quigleys Mill, Park. Parks postal area recorded an increase in Covid cases last week, and despite the attachment to Derry city skewing the numbers, Greg admits there is still a degree of worry locally. “The majority of the population feel we still have to be serious about this. Its drilled into everybody at this stage, like putting your seatbelt on in the car,” he says. “The worry now is were straddling the Donegal border to a certain extent and case numbers are very high either side of it. “There is more positivity now than there was maybe six weeks ago though. Society is opening up again, and the vaccinations are a positive thing.” Covid has taken its toll on rural le too, and compliance with regulations has come at a social cost for village communities. “Where were based is very much a rural area, with a lot of the farming community and tradesmen and stuff,” says Greg. “You get some people who, by chance, meet up outside the shop here and have an opportunity to have a chat that maybe havent seen each other in a few months. “Those guys would have been at markets or farm meets every week, or pubs, but now you see them sitting out there for half an hour chatting to each other. “The social aspect, face to face, is the biggest thing. “The local community group have done a lot of work with the walkways there over the past number of years, which is very good.” Caroline Lynch and Catriona Doughty from Learmount Community Development Group. The local community group to which Greg refers is Learmount Community Development Group, which is nestled down a lane next to the entrance to Learmount Forest. Over the last year, Caroline Lynch and Catriona Doughty have noticed a big increase in people using Parks hidden gem. “We would have come down here some mornings and that car park would be full,” says Caroline. “Our secret Learmount Forest isnt a secret any more, and thats great, because everybody wants out, and weve had drop-ins coming from that.” “The forest has been fantastic for people being able to get out and safely meet their neighbours,” adds Catriona. “Theyll maybe call in at quiet times to have a socially distanced cup of tea. That social aspect has been missed, they are missing company and casual conversation.” Caroline feels the experience of the last year has sharpened focus on the issue of loneliness that had been hiding in plain sight. “We had a man who lives alone and had been sick for two or three days,” she says. “He hadnt been out and had no food in the house, so thankfully we were able to help with that. “You just know people are lonely and looking to get out again, but at the same time are a bit anxious about it. “Theyre happy to take the summer out of it and see what happens. There is certainly a lot of loneliness, isolation and depression though. “You could obviously be in the middle of a housing site and still be lonely, but when you see some of the people on their own, up a lane, they see nobody. They barely even see the postman now.” Working with both young and old people, the group have seen the effect the pandemic and its associated lockdowns have had on both generations.  “A lot of our work is with older people, and whilst theyre saying theyre fed up, some of them are getting a wee bit set in their ways,” says Caroline. “You just know by talking to them. We had a woman who always came in every week, even when it was bad, and she hasnt been in about two months. “Its highlighted how much we miss the social side of things, not being able to get out and meet friends. Even for the youth. “People always think all they need is their phone, because thats all theyre sitting on, but you can see now how the youth are crying out as much for social contact as any other generation.” There is hope though, that with the vaccines roll out and the upcoming warmer weather, that the group will be able to run some of their usual summer events. “We are looking at putting together a summer programme, but wed be a bit nervous ourselves about bringing a group of people into the room,” says Caroline.  “It would be perfectthere was good weather, because it will be planned outdoors. If the weather is bad, well take it over to Park hall, because its a bit bigger than here. “We have funding for dancing and music, which I think people would love to hear. Wed love to have tables out there on a nice evening, with a bit of a barbecue and a bit of music. “Youd like to think by September, we should be able to get going.” On the way back through the village, the shutters are half up on the Rio Grande as preparations continue inside. By the time you read this it will have reopened its doors. Hospitality has ed throughout the county, another step on the road to recovery. The farmers outside Greg McElhinneys store now have somewhere  to shoot the breeze. For the next few weeks at least, Covid fears will be drowned out by clink of glasses, the audible relief of the repressed socialite and the laughter of friends reunited. Dancing, however, is still prohibited under the regulations. It may need to be done across Parks Rio Grande, rather than inside it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Filming on The School for Good and Evil is currently continuing in Belfast. However, SDLP councillor Shauna Cusack said Derry had also been considered as a filming base for the movie. Cllr Cusack revealed details of Derrys bid as she put forward a motion at the monthly meeting yesterday of Derry City and Strabane District which called for more to be done to promote the local council region as a destination for the film and broadcast industry. Starring Charlize Theron, Laurence Fishburne and Kerry Washington, The School for Good and Evil is based on a best-selling series of young adult fantasy novels. googletag.cmd.push It is currently being filmed atBelfast Harbour Studios. It is understood the production crew will be in Northern Ireland for at least  weeks and Northern Ireland Screen estimates that it will generate investment of approximately poundm with around  crew working on the film. Speaking at yesterdays meeting, Cllr Cusack said Derry came very close to securing part of the films production. “Regrettably for a number of reasons we lost out to Belfast which as we all know is currently the go-to hub for productions that decide to come here. “Belfast is going from strength to strength and the city is currently hosting two major productions for both Netflix and Paramount along with several other high profile BBC dramas and they are employing over , crew. googletag.cmd.push “I feel that we need to improve our ambition and profile in this sector in order to compete for business. As opposed to waiting for opportunities, to actively seek them. “With the industry booming in both Ireland and the UK, many cities are seeing the benefits of being shovel-ready for companies. “Most cities and councils on these islands have already developed their own film departments to showcase their own locations. We have not.” Cllr Cusack said the success of Derry Girls in particular had shown Derrys potential as a location for TV and film production but added that the council had to be serious about building on that success.     She also asked that the council do more to support and promote young local broadcasting talent. “As a council we need to be moving forward with the times, trends and technology. Film and broadcast is an intrinsic part of every day le now and council need to embrace that. “Ultimately, we want jobs and long-term opportunities to improve lives and the economy here. “Finally, and to steal a line from a famous movie, I firmly believe thatwe build it they will come.” Cllr Cusacks motion was supported by all other parties on the council. Sinn Fein councillor Conor Heaney said the film and TV industry had great potential. “I think it definitely should be a focus for the Business and Culture committee of this council,” he said. The motion was also supported by DUP Alderman Keith Kerrigan who highlighted the impact that the filming of Game of Thrones in Northern Ireland had on the tourism industry. However, Alderman Kerrigan said it was important that the entire council region was marketed and not just the city. People Before Profit councillor Maeve ONeill praised the trailblazers in Derry who had worked in the TV and film industry for many years. She said some of these old hands could be used as part of efforts to develop the local potential. Alliance councillor Rachael Ferguson also highlighted the potential for local colleges to get involved in the initiative. Ulster Unionist councillor Derek Hussey said the motion was a no brainer and he was fully in support of it. Alderman Hussey said he could not understand why a film had never been made about the  Siege of Derry.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Liam Hannaway,chair of the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, welcomed the latest funding support. “This year’s annual allocation of exchequer and National Lottery funding is largely standstill for most of our key arts organisation,” he said. “In order to mitigate the continuing impact of Covid-, we have already released upfront payments of % of last year’s grant to  applicants. googletag.cmd.push “This offers an element of stability to many amidst current programming and strategic uncertainty, as the sector prepares to reopen. Commenting on the department’s funding allocation to ACNI, Communities Minister, Deirdre Hargey,said, said such support was an important part of the foundations on which the work of our vital arts and creative sector is built. “These awards come at a point where the Executive has agreed a series of important relaxations that will make a real dference for participation in the arts and with the Culture, Arts and Heritage Recovery Taskforce beginning its work. “Taken together these represent an important contribution to supporting the peopleand organisations who work across the arts to be able to do their important work.     “I recognise the pressure that continues to be felt financially, creatively and at a personal level across the creative community, even as we begin the process of reopening and recovery. “I also recognise that more support will be needed this year and so I was particularly pleased to welcome the Executive’s decision last week to allocate a further round of poundm Covid funding to Arts, Culture and Heritage to support the social recovery.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was a night of drama from first whistle to the last as City were very nearly embarrassed by a Drogheda team which finished the game with  men. The quarterfinal game took place on September , with City hoping to reach their second FAI Cup final in three years. Things looked to be going to plan for Derry boss Peter Hutton and his players when Ryan McBride scored to give the visitors an early lead. googletag.cmd.push Drogheda’s joy at equalising through Alan McNally ten minutes later was tempered by a red card to Peter McGlynn, with the hosts facing the prospect of playing with ten men for over an hour. It got worse for Drogheda as they were then reduced to nine men, with Shane Grimes bring red carded early in the second half. Incredibly though, the hosts then took the lead with another goal from McNally, and Derry were on their way out of the cup. Relentless The Candy Stripes knocked relentlessly at the Drogheda door but the goal just would not come. It was sheer desperation for City who completely dominated with their numerical advantage. googletag.cmd.push It was all or nothing and with just five minutes remaining, midfielder Philip Lowry was in the right place at the right time to volley Derry level. The drama was far from finished however as Drogheda were then reduced to eight men with Gavin Holohan receiving his marching orders. It seemed certain that Derry would find a winner in the time remaining, but the hosts held on to set up a replay at the Brandywell just four days later. City won the replay -, with Rory Patterson scoring a hat trick and Michael Duffy and Patrick McEleney also scoring. They beat Shamrock Rovers in the semi-final before losing - to St. Patrick’s Athletic in the final.       --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

His -year playing career ended on the Evergreens in the early s.Joersquos role as match secretary for twenty years was absolutely crucial given his unique ability to dig out players when all seemed lost, recruiting players at Down High on Saturday mornings to fulfil fixtures later that day.Complete strangers would often turn up for second  matches in the early days saying that Joe had instructed them to turn up and play.Despite his tireless work on behalf of the club, Joersquos greatest pleasure throughout his rugby le has been the friends he has made along the way.A keen tourist, he has travelled the world to follow rugby and even took in some of the Lions fixtures in South Africa in .He was tour manager on the legendary  Ballynahinch tour of Canada, as well as partaking in a few trips away with the Evergreens.When promotion to the All-Ireland League was secured in , Joe was a regular spectator at games all over the country and could be seen at every first XV home fixture in his familiar spot on the m line until very recently.The flat cap, long navy Adidas coat, familiar cough and half pint of Harp should conjure up an image of Joe to everyone who knows him, and to countless others who have passed through the Ballynahinch club in recent years not knowing the huge influence he has had on their rugby.Joe is the recipient of the coveted Spence Cup this season. He is truly deserving of this award and it is le-affirming to see that friendships gained through team sports run deep as Sam Robinson, himself a Spence Cup winner, acts as carer for Joe as his health deteriorates.Rugby it seems, is giving something back to one of itrsquos finest local servants.On behalf of the Spence family, Emma Rice commened: ldquoThe Spence Cup is given to a member who shows an example of commitment to the rugby club. Joe Carlislersquos service to the club in time and deed epitomises this.ldquoA society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they will never sit in. We are often guilty of not noticing a tree that gives the shade we sit under, she continued.ldquoPlayers of today may no longer see as much of that familiar face on the m line at Ballymacarn Park, but they will see the roots, the structure, the shade and benefit from what wee Joe once planted.

Itrsquos been very challenging for carers and their loved ones, and people often forget that carersrsquo lives are adversely affected too.ldquoImagine having a spouse or parent who no longer recognises you and who due to this awful disease you no longer recognise.One of the things that resonates with both women is the thought of any loved one losing all our precious memories.Ciara continued: ldquoResearch into the causes of, and treatment for dementia is critically important but not a priority for UK governments.ldquoWe would love to see this dreadful disease eradicated for future generations. We both have strong ties to Northern Ireland, being from here, although we both spent time living and working in England and Scotland before moving home to settle back in Co Down. Our mutual love of baking and cooking was how we met and became friends.The two bakers organised a virtual bake sale to raise money for dementia research.However they soon realised that due to geography not everyone could buy their fabulous baking, so they set up a JustGiving page to run alongside the bake sale.ldquoPlanning the challenges of a bake sale during lockdown was fun, so too was choosing some of our most popular products to sell to raise money, said Sharon.ldquoThe menu proved so popular.

He had been a vital cog in the Down Rec team which enjoyed great success in the late Seventies.But it was and remains the case that the Down Rec experience is defined by the enduring friendships which have stood the test of time.Coot grew up in Stream Street and the reason he knocked back opportunities to perform at levels his talent merited may well lie there.That part of Downpatrick had three working class housing developments, Ardpatrick and Russell Park with Stream Street and Ibrox Park in the middle.Ibrox was their playground, the place where Coot first kicked a football.He was a Stream Street kid and it seems he never wanted to be anything .When Jim Prior took him to Down Rec, it was a marriage made in heaven.In that dressing room you had another more senior Stream Street kid. Coot would have idolized Tony lsquoDartrsquo Curran in those days as he was the leader of the pack.Russell Park resident Barney Fitzsimmons was there too, a swashbuckling goalscorer who enjoyed something akin to Roy of the Rovers status at the time.Then you had the late great Paddy lsquoGeordyrsquo Galbraith, who combined a hard man reputation with a heart of gold.Peter Mulhall was another player he would have admired, a winner who proved the perfect centre back partner for the laid-back Coot.The total respect he had for them was accorded to all of us even though he was a better player than any of us. That was Coot Connolly.Prior realized that he needed to recruit from outside Downpatrick to fulfill his ambitions for the club and over a period of time he recruited players from Portaferry, Strangford, Ardglass, Dundrum, Crossgar, Saintfield, Killyleagh and Ballygowan.They were brought in for their ability but Jim couldnrsquot have known that the erse personalities therein would create the perfect storm in the dressing room.Neither could he have anticipated the level of support which flowed from those villages in the seasons to come.Dressing rooms are bastions of banter and slagging and with Dart jester-in chief, the group relished every minute they spent together.The five strong Portaferry contingent proved to be a vital ingredient, their earthy Ards humour and the opportunities their accents provided for slagging sealing their popularity.Jackie Leckey and Barney Ross brought another dimension willing as they were to join in the shenanigans on and off the pitch. Coot loved the craic and happily joined in the banter.However, he left the slagging to other less sensitive creatures of which there were plenty.A good example was the time I decided to get the footballers perm which was in vogue at the time. I should have known better.I got slaughtered, Dart declaring that I looked more like Shirley Temple than Kevin Keegan.Those were the days, as the saying goes, but happily there were plenty of good days ahead of us.We have had many reunions with Coot, an ever present and every one of them underlined the strength of the bond we enjoy so much.Sadly those reunions tend to be confined to wakes and funerals nowadays and the baby of our team has now joined Shane Breen, Paddy Galbraith and Marty Ross on the sidelines.Coot would have been the first to remind me that the Rec wasnrsquot only about the players.The one and only Charlie Oakes was highly influential in his role as assistant manager, while Austy Keating doubled as chairman and groundsman for many years.Joe Lyttle was our physio and his son Joea loyal player for years while my sister Tina was a committee member and a fanatical fan.They were all fully paid up members of the Rec family and we continue to mourn their loss.I would love to have name checked every single member of the Rec family in this piece but time and space didnrsquot allow. My apologies.The laughter which rang through Cootrsquos house during his wake was a fitting farewell for someone who loved to laugh.He was a very special human being. We will miss him forever.

Ben Lowry writes: \"We should emphasise our integral place in one of the great parliamentary democracies, in a country that is a world leader in science and arts, and our shared history and institutions such as theBBC\"A moderate Ulster Unionist Party and a conservative DUP.Instead, there was drama in the DUP, which reflected unionist confusion. But unionism can be open minded on many issues while standing firm on these principles:. Challenge the idea of a ‘process’ That republican concept of a peace ‘process’ is used to move Northern Ireland halfway between the UK and Republic of Ireland, via small concessions . But the UK hasagreed that Scotland and Northern Ireland can leave on a % +  vote. Spain, Canada, France, the US, do not make it so easy for their regions to go. UK nationalists have won an advantage that is the dream of separatists where. In , there must be no dilution of sovereignty unless and until there is a vote to go.. Three strands must be observedLast year the DUP let Dublin jointly author a deal toStormont that included policy pledges that were Strand One matters . Doug Beattie wanted the UUP to go into opposition then. If the assembly falls again, there need to be clear demarcation as to which political talks involve Irish officials, particularly given that Ireland pushes nationalist concerns while the UK stays neutral.. SF won’t get reward for collapseSinn Fein brought down Stormont over RHI yet its only unwavering red line for ato devolution was an Irish language act . Unionists let their reasonable opposition to blackmail be depicted as ‘both sides’ having red lines. They should never again endorse a deal that rewards blackmail. . Beware of culture warsShowing proper respect for Gaelic culture such as language and sport is essential, but should not tip into weakness in the face of openly stated republican aims to use culture to secure political advance. . Seek friends across IrelandThe republican electoral march on both sides of the border is not inevitable as shown by the  general election, and the slow SF Dail advance in the decade after .Nationalist Ireland was ambivalent about the IRA in the Troubles, reflected in Irish extradition policy, but support for the Provisionals was small. Among NI Catholics, , %+ consistently voted against Sinn Fein after they began contesting elections in the s. The Republic was even more anti. The SF got %-% until the late s.Unionists have rarely courted SF critics, even those who became Taoiseach . Such leaders need support, given that elements of Fianna Fail and Fine Gael seem happy to usher SF into power. . Develop diplomatic skillsNorthern Ireland unionists seem to have few friends, yet the pool of potential allies is vast in England and Wales, given shared history. Scotland, even more so.Much of the American establishment still sees itself as Scots Irish . And many more are fond of the British link, despite the historic breach, and could be sympathetic to points such as NI’srole in the still close UK-US alliance.I have also seen curious visitors, who have no prior NI link, arrive branding unionists oppressors but leave seeing them as a vulnerable minority.. Don’t let NI be a ‘place apart’A nationalist strategy, in Scotland and NI, is to make it so dferent from England and Wales as to be unrecognisable as part of the UK.NI unionists are acquiescing in this, in part due to confusion about what is local and what is national. Core issues such as defence and trade are decided at national level of any state, something the NI protocol shatters .The Tory Henry Hill wants a new Campaign for Equal Citizenship for Northern Ireland within the UK.. Challenge misuse of ‘rights’Gerry Adams said “what’s going to break them is equality”. Influential people of a similar mindset seem to think the citing of ‘human rights’ in court to change policy will do the same. The  Stormont deal advanced a Bill of Rights for NI, which republicans hope will separate us from GB and strike down laws. No unionist should back it. Don’t be mercenary about moneyMoney is the benefit unionists most cite about the UK but a grasping approach alienates people in GB. We should emphasise our integral place in one of the great parliamentary democracies, in a country that is a world leader in science and arts, and our shared history and institutions such as theBBC.. Pay heed to history and legacyThe IRA have made legacy a priority and are turning the narrative against state forces who prevented civil war. The problem is rooted in unionist neglect of history. I attended two schools that were culturally British, yet was being exposed to text books in the s that subtly pushed the apartheid NI lie .. Don’t fuel the New Ireland pushThe Republic has changed radically since , when Home Rule really was Rome Rule, but Brexit has also revealed an enduring anglophobia. Unionists should stop giving cover to an ‘old’ united Ireland plan, to shunt us out of a society of  million people into an small island unit that will align itself with Germany and France before recognising the huge historic British contribution to this island. Celebrate the NI centenaryThe downplaying of the centenary of our country, Northern Irleand, is a scandal. But as we emerge from lockdown we still have six months to celebrate, in a non tribal way, what London won’t.. Reject the NI ProtocolThere are strong pragmatic arguments for the protocol but they are not unionist ones. Yet Edwin Poots seems as pragmatic about the Irish Sea border as was Arlene Foster. Doug Beattie said on Good Morning Ulster this week that the NHS was more important than the protocol. Why keep unionist in the title of his partyso The UK has said in court that the Act of Union is repealed. That has to be the number one issue for anyone whose objective is staying in one of the greatest nations in history.. Unionists are not AllianceThe Alliance Party vote has risen to %+. But unionism on a bad day still gets %. Some people are talking up the Alliance surge to get unionists to move closer to a position of agnosticism on the Union. Don’t. . Get tough on securitySee on page  a bid for tougher on terror sentencing in GB. Yet NI is still soft about dissident bail and sentencing. Unionists should demand Stormont gets robust on those who kill.. Conscience is privateSame-sex relations, abortion, etc are conscience issues. If the UUP wants to encourage liberal positions and the DUP traditional ones, they should still allow a free vote.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...The source said that North Antrim MP Ian Paisley Jr’s claim on Thursday night that his father had died of a broken heart after being toppled as DUP leader in  had exposed a key source of the party’s ision.They said: “Ian’s contribution was really signicant in laying bare the real reason for a lot of this. It’s about ing the DUP to its roots.”However, a source on Mr Poots’s side of the party said that it had been a power struggle and that those who until now had been the party establishment “just can’t come to terms with the fact that they’ve lost power”.Sir Jeffrey, outgoing leader Arlene Foster, Economy Minister Diane Dodds, East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson, East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell and others then walked out during an interval in the meeting, pointedly not staying to listen to the new leader’s acceptance speech.Former Fermanagh and South Tyrone DUP constituency association chairman Paul Bell resigned on the steps of the Crowne Plaza hotel where the meeting was happening, telling reporters that senior party figures acted to “assassinate our leader”.However, he inadvertently confirmed something which earlier in the week Mrs Foster has questioned — the existence of the letter of no confidence which persuaded her to walk away.Mrs Foster had said that she had not seen the letter and suggested it might not exist, but Mr Bell said: “I think that those  members have a lot to think about — that signed that letter [sic]”.Veteran BBC political corespondent Gareth Gordon, who spent Thursday night at the hotel reporting on the drama, said yesterday: “The poison that’s pouring out is just incredible. It’s almost asit’s been kept bottled up for years ... nobody is trying to hide it.”Yesterday did not see a slew of public resignations from the party, but there was a mutinous atmosphere among many of those who opposed Mr Poots for the leadership.Some senior figures on Sir Jeffrey Donaldson’s side of the party are considering radical options.Last night one such inidual did not dismiss the idea of a string of unionist independents banding together in an alliance — although they accepted that there is not space for a fourth major unionist party.When askedthe imperative to unite for next year’s crucial assembly election will bring the party together behind the new leader or whether the isions are too deep to be bridged, he said: “I think it’s the latter more than the former. “We will lose people.”He added that it was “a huge mistake on Edwin’s part” to deny the party executive a secret vote on whether to raty him as leader.As the party spin about being a “family” was exposed, last night the PSNI confirmed they were investigatinga complaint that members of the party had been threatened during the leadership contestJournalist Rodney Edwards reported that Sir Jeffrey told Thursday night’s meeting that the UDA had “threatened” some of his team during the contest.The DUP said in a statement: “There was no intimidation or bullying. Any suggestions are baseless and without foundation. “Executive members freely expressed their opinions without fear or favour.”Mr Poots yesterday condemned the allegation and said that the police should deal with it.Yesterday Mrs Foster confirmed that she plans to leave the DUP and local politics entirely when she resigns as first minister. And the DUP leader threatened to quit that post next weekMr Poots decides to carry a reshuffle of the party’s ministerial team.When askedshe had any regrets, she said: “All of us are going to look back and wish we had done some things dferently. But it’s important to learn from that – everyone makes mistakes, but we should use the lessons from this to move forward.”Yesterday former DUP councillor Guy Spence, who quit the party last year in circumstance which have not been publicly explained, said on Twitter: “When I felt the wrath of the twisted, bitter, hateful culture of the DUP over a year ago I asked the leadership for an investigation.“They washed their hands and looked the other way without responding, instead focusing on spin and deflection.“A year on, they now know what it feels like as the stench brewing on their watch has erupted all over themselves.”Reflecting on the public stre, former DUP MLA David McIlveen said that “the ramications for the unionist family are potentially catastrophic”.He told the Nolan Show that  was “a year in which unionism should have been rejuvenating itself” as it marked the centenary but instead the DUP was tearing itself apart.The former North Antrim MLA said that “the only losers in this are unionism” and that for those losing positions at the top of the DUP “le will go on for them”, but unionism will suffer.Mr McIlveen, the son of Free Presbyterian minister the Rev David McIlveen, said that “there is a culture of fear within the party” and that “no lessons have been learned” by the party since the RHI scandal.New Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie, whose ratication as leader on Thursday was as smooth as the DUP’s was messy, said that his party was talking to at least five DUP councillors but they must “share our vision” before joining.:Sam McBride: A curious episode shows that the NI protocol is now too confusing for even the EU to understandSam McBride: After four years at the top of Sinn Féin, Michelle O’Neill has good reason to be nervousSam McBride: Rather than a DUP lurch to the right, this is about toppling the old orderSam McBride: Is stolen Northern Bank cash in politics  Alarmingly, no one seems botheredSam McBride: How Arlene Foster fell: Even as she dismissed the threat, the knives were being plungedAs Edwin Poots steps forward to contest DUP leadership, Peter Robinson urges cautionSam McBride: The most important firm in Northern Ireland you’ve probably never heard of – but are paying forSam McBride: On the streets and in Stormont, the next few months look bleak for Northern IrelandAnarchy on the Shankill as men and women urge children to riot, with no hint of political protestLeaked internal DUP minutes show fear of looming electoral collapse, and dismay at party’s directionBrandon Lewis interview: Denial of the Irish Sea border is gone as SoS says parts of frontier are being ditched for good——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt was girl power when ten female walkers joined Joy and sheepdog Bracken from Penarth and District Ramblers at Penarth clftop for an . mile walk, with no stiles only gates and which would see them experiencing the weather of all four seasons in one day. They set off on a socially distanced walk in lovely spring sunshine across the old pitch and putt course before joining part of the old railway line, now a walk and cycle way, and heading through a built up area Lavernock Road led them into Cosmeston Country Park.Past the eastern lake with its floating jetty where canoes can be safely launched and making their way through the eastern paddock with its carpet of pretty cowslips, open meadows led them towards Old Cogan Hall Farm, where they deviated into the churchyard of St Peterrsquos for morning break in glorious warm sunshine reminiscent of summer. Admiring the herring bone masonry which dates to Celtic and Saxon times and the ancient yew trees that could even pre-date this lovely old church, which allegedly is the oldest building in Penarth and hearing some of its long and interesting history, it fell into disrepair in the th century. By the th century the ruinous building was a cattle shelter until the latter part of the rsquos when the rd Marquis of Bute was persuaded to pay for its renovation.Mile Road built by the Bute family led them to the western paddock and through the sun-dappled Cogan Wood to re-enter fields where a footbridge led them across the Sully Brook for the short climb up to Home Farm, with its glorious views towards the eastern end of Barry and the surrounding farmland. Exiting through a gate, some road walking in a southerly direction brought them into Sully village and pounding pavements to reach the Jubilee Hall and the cricket field, the full beauty of Sully Bay with its views across the Bristol Channel towards the Somerset coastline and Hayes Point to the west confronted them.     With the wind beginning to pick up they tramped by track and field to the public slipway at Sully beach and stopped for lunch utilising rocks for seating whilst gazing eastwards towards Sully Island and Flat and Steep Holm beyond, as clouds thickened overhead and the temperature dropped making it feel more like autumn.Time to move on along part of the long distance Wales Coast Path, through the playing fields to exit onto Beach Road, following it to the car park of the Captainrsquos We where there were only a few people sitting at outdoor tables for food and drink, not really enjoyable in the cool breeze.The fairly quiet St Maryrsquos Well Bay Road brought them up past The Bay Caravan Park and into fields with growing crops where, without any warning a sudden short sharp shower of rain engulfed the group forcing coats to be swtly donned.Crossing a wooden footbridge into the delightful Lavernock Nature Reserve the grassy path led them into the remains of the WW gun emplacements. Initially in the late rsquos the original Lavernock Gun Battery was built to protect the Bristol and Cardf shipyards and the Bristol Channel, but unfortunately most of the original buildings now lie underneath the caravan park.Being bombarded by a short hail storm whilst moving on through the nature reserve, lovingly cared for by volunteers and passing the man-made pond with its surrounding carpet of bluish violet bugle, a plant which attracts moths, butterflies and bees, before exiting onto Fort Road their route led them past the Marconi Holiday Village and the Church of St Lawrence before heading along the clftop. With thick black clouds heading up the English side of the Bristol Channel, the race was on to get back before the rain hit. As the weather turned wintry and the wind increased, a huge shower of hailstones and heavy rain struck them on the open Penarth clftop soaking them as they made their way back to their start point.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits before, during and after lockdown on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He raised concerns that the hundreds of new houses in and around Llantwit Major arenrsquot seeing the increased investment in local public services needed to cater for the growing population.He said: ldquoThere are more and more houses in the town. Therersquos hardly any green space left and our services are really struggling.Two doctors surgeries currently cater for the town: Coastal Vale and Western Vale.
