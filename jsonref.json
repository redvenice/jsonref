According to Mammoth author Chris Flynn, the American obsession dates back to the 1700s• Read more about  Australia’s Unmissables seriesBarack Obama had two Portuguese water dogs, Bo and Sunny. George W Bush had scottish terriers named Barney and Miss Beazley. Bill Clinton had a cat called Socks. John F Kennedy doted on his canary, Robin.US presidents have always had domestic animals at the White House, although the farther back we delve, the more ferocious the menagerie tends to be, particularly where Republican presidents are concerned. Calvin Coolidge owned a hippopotamus and two lions named Tax Reduction and Budget Bureau. John Quincy Adams is said to have kept an alligator in a bathroom. He supposedly found it amusing to surprise guests by sending them in there to conduct their business, presumably causing them to do so prior to removing their pantaloons.Theodore Roosevelt took animal ownership to extremes. During his tenure, a lion, a hyena called Bill, a coyote, a black bear named Jonathan Edwards and a zebra lived at various times on the White House grounds. He also shot a reputed 11,397 creatures. Among them were lions, leopards, cheetahs, hyenas, elephants and endangered rhinoceroses.I uncovered this curious power dynamic while researching my new book, Mammoth. It began with Thomas Jefferson, who, in an attempt to overcompensate for feelings of US inadequacy, appropriated symbols of strength from the animal kingdom to show that America was the greatest nation on earth.Jefferson’s nemesis was the French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, le Comte de Buffon. In volume five of his 1781 book Natural History, General and Particular, Buffon coined his Theory of American Degeneracy. In it, he claimed that animals in the US were weaker, smaller and fewer in number than in the rest of the world.As minister to France, Jefferson was determined to prove America’s virility to the Europeans. On one trip he packed a large panther skin with the idea of shaking it under Buffon’s nose. Later he produced a moose. The French were unimpressed. Desperate for America to appear bigger and better than everyone else – and to promote US democracy as the superior form of government – Jefferson then hired several groups of hardy pioneers to secure him a mammoth.He had heard rumours of large bones found by explorers in various wilderness locations. He believed they belonged to a mastodon larger than anything that had ever existed in Europe, and he actively promoted the idea that such a beast might still roam the country’s west.“The bones of the Mammoth which have been found in America, are as large as those found in the old world. It may be asked, why I insert the Mammoth, as if it still existed? I ask in return, why I should omit it, as if it did not exist? Such is the economy of nature, that no instance can be produced of her having permitted any one race of her animals to become extinct,” he wrote in 1781’s Notes on the State of Virginia.Jefferson’s gambit paid idends. Mammoth bones were unearthed from farmland and displayed by iniduals such as the Philadelphia painter Charles Willson Peale. Mammoth fever gripped the nation. A 20lb vegetable grown in New York was proclaimed to be a mammoth radish. A Washington man ate 42 chicken eggs in 10 minutes and declared himself a mammoth eater. In Cheshire, Massachusetts, a Baptist pastor and ardent republican, John Leland, urged his congregation to produce a mammoth cheese weighing 1,235lb. It was gifted to Jefferson, who had it for lunch on New Year’s Day, 1802.Jefferson procured and assembled his bones, spending many evenings in the White House poring over his treasures. His obsession led to accusations of negligence from colleagues and rivals alike. Little could they know that the legacy of a perceived inferiority complex would embed itself deep in the American psyche and endure for hundreds of years.Modern presidents have, for the most part, softened their stance on trophies and the appropriation of powerful animal symbols, choosing instead to enjoy the companionship of dogs, cats and horses. Democratic presidents have tended more towards cuddly critters. In addition to his beloved canary, Kennedy had a rabbit called Zsa Zsa. Lyndon B Johnson had hamsters. Jimmy Carter had an adorable Siamese cat called Misty Malarky Ying Yang.Donald Trump, for the record, is the first president in history to have no pets. None with four legs, at any rate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/010ee661e7492c2eef19886e8b8d80aa5acf8a40/0_163_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e1098349cb5dffb4ee34843e618eb88","title":"supermarket staff workers tell us coronavirus affected your work","story":"Are you under extra pressure?

But scientists may be made the real scapegoatsWhen Boris Johnson was recovering in hospital after his admission to intensive care, he was advised not to work. There was no suggestion this time from No 10 that he would even be supplied with a red box. The prime minister’s decision to work remotely following his coronavirus diagnosis seemed misjudged given how he deteriorated, so there was an effort to get him to watch films rather than look at paperwork. However, he did manage to call a handful of ministers – one of whom was Matt Hancock.The beleaguered health secretary has been in the news this week as a potential “fall guy” for the government over its handling of coronavirus. Among the hostile briefings, a No 10 source complained to the  that Hancock’s promise in a press conference earlier this month of 100,000 tests by the end of the month would “come back to bite him” and suggested the figure was “arbitrary”. Meanwhile, senior Tories are speculating that he will be moved from his brief before any public inquiry.While Hancock is the minister most clearly in the firing line, there has been a change over the past week. As the prime minister’s health has improved, MPs and ministers have become more loose-lipped when it comes to concerns over the government strategy and lockdown – with senior Tories kicking off about the economic impact of lockdown and a growing cabinet debate over the exit strategy.In recent weeks, there has been annoyance within the government at the 100,000 test target. When Hancock made that promise at a press conference in early April, it followed a few days of bad headlines for the government which included mixed messaging and an uninspiring performance from the business secretary, Alok Sharma, the day before.Hancock’s high energy performance, after which he took follow-up questions from assembled journalists for the first time, won immediate plaudits from the media. But it irked many who had been working behind the scenes and in other departments. There was a sense that the health secretary was enjoying the limelight a little too much.This Downing Street likes to pride itself on not dancing to the media’s tune, but announcing a timelined target was seen in some quarters as an example of doing just that. Although the prime minister had previously spoken about 250,000 tests, he had not given the same hard deadline. While the government still believes it could reach 100,000 capacity by the end of the month, getting that many people to take the tests will be more difficult. At the moment, around half the capacity is going unused each day. And any failure on testing will be used to paint a picture of a government on the back foot over coronavirus.While Hancock may not be minister of the month – he’s also not enemy No 1. And in the weeks ahead, No 10 and the Department of Health are likely to form an important alliance when it comes to the exit strategy. The expectation in the government is that so long as his recovery continues, it will now be the prime minister who makes the final decision on easing lockdown in a few weeks.When it comes to the whole cabinet – not just the four ministers (Hancock, Rishi Sunak, Dominic Raab and Michael Gove) who lead the coronavirus subcommittees – it is currently weighted in favour of a significant easing of lockdown measures in three weeks’ time.One of the reasons Hancock has received a hostile reception from his cabinet colleagues is that he is viewed as the chief lockdown “dove” of the cabinet – the minister who is the most cautious about easing any restrictions. This is in many ways natural as his brief is health – just as so-called hawk Sunak’s is the economy.Inside the government there is frustration that the ministers not involved in the day-to-day decisions have taken to knocking those who are in the engine room. “There are two types of people during a pandemic: those who spend all their time dealing with a pandemic and those who aren’t involved and spend their time complaining,” says a government source.Hancock could soon have an important ally in the prime minister. While Johnson is not back in Downing Street, he has met with his top team and is said to be very cautious about easing the lockdown. Ministers who had thought Johnson’s return would help the cause of the hawks look set to be disappointed. Although there is still an expectation of some movement, the priority is avoiding a second peak of cases.While Hancock looks set to have support in the coming weeks, there’s another reason to expect him not to be the scapegoat in any government inquiry. Blaming a Tory minister in that forum would be an implicit acceptance that the whole strategy was flawed. “It won’t be blue-on-blue,” says one government figure.Instead, as becomes clearer with each press conference and each rebuttal, any defence will be focused on the scientific guidance. Already there are concerns among scientists that they could be in the firing line. The Tories in the line of fire are more likely to be figures from the Theresa May ministry. Questions are being repeatedly asked about the lack of government preparedness for a pandemic – but much of that goes back a few years.• Katy Balls is the Spectator’s deputy political editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2281b10802f4dace569fa635d83d1394b94c68c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ee576237adf79399a19c9a79b0f8052","title":"social distancing social pods coronavirus lockdown","story":"‘Social pods’ of people isolating together could help make life bearable – whatever happens, we’re going to need to get creativeIf you could choose to be locked down with any five people, who would they be?It’s a coronavirus parlour game that did the rounds of social media in the early days, back when quarantine was still almost a novelty. The catch was that all the fantasy lockdown houses on offer were stuffed with celebrities, and within every oyster lurked some unappealing grit. Want Nigella Lawson in your quarantine squad? Fine, but you’ll have to take some aggravating Z-lister too. Yet as the siege grinds on, and the well of loneliness deepens, for some the fantasy quarantine buddy game may take a more serious turn.One in four adults understandably say they have felt lonely since this outbreak brought the social shutters clanging down. But it’s the deeper damage done by prolonged isolation whose consequences we will be living with for years to come elderly people sinking into cognitive decline for lack of another human being to talk to, toddlers missing out on crucial social skills because they can’t learn by playing with other toddlers, singletons wretched at the prospect of months without human touch.When the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, warns of “disruptive” social distancing measures lasting at least to the end of this year or Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, talks of extending some measures into 2021, they’re really only spelling out the obvious: we have no choice but to be in this for the long haul. Any vaccine or cure could be a year away at best and we are almost certainly further than ministers like to admit from a workable mass “test, trace, isolate” strategy.And that’s where the idea of quarantine buddies comes in - although Prof Stefan Flasche, epidemiologist and mathematical modeller at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, prefers the formal term “contact clustering”.The experimental concept he is currently plugging into his model is that instead of keeping strictly to socialising within their own households, a couple of families or a group of friends could agree to form an exclusive social pod. Everyone in it would still avoid anything but essential contact with outsiders, but within the circle of trust, they could relax and let their guard down. Children could play together, adults might pool home-schooling duties to give themselves time to work, and lonely single people could find someone to hang out with.Pod members wouldn’t necessarily move in with each other, but would probably need to live near each other, as well as getting on well enough to tolerate being each other’s main source of entertainment. But crucially, they’d have to care enough about each other’s welfare to be scrupulously faithful to the pod. Like lovers at the peak of the HIV epidemic trusting each other not to sleep around, each member’s safety would rely on the others not sneakily seeing other friends on the side, and taking sensible precautions if they did need to go out. But if the worst happened, and someone did accidentally bring the virus home, at least it should be relatively easy to trace contacts and contain the spread.It will be weeks before Flasche’s modelling produces even a preliminary idea of whether any of this is feasible without pushing the national infection rate unacceptably high. Even then, it wouldn’t in and of itself be an answer to the economic crisis looming if lockdown goes on much longer. But other countries are venturing cautiously down a similar path: Belgium’s elegantly named “deconfinement” committee has proposed letting groups of up to 10 people meet socially once a week, so long as it’s always the same 10. In Israel, up to three families can share childcare. Even in Britain, separated couples shuttling the kids between two households are arguably dipping a toe in this water.It might be hard to police in practice, but if anything this epidemic has shown that when lives are at stake, people are keener to stick to the rules than ministers had anticipated. And as Flasche points out, the longer the lockdown drags on, the greater the risk of desperate people starting to relax the rules off their own bat if there is any way of doing it relatively safely, now would be the time to find out.As the father of a four-year-old who struggles to interact properly with her friends through screens, Flasche’s initial interest was in tackling small children’s desperation for physical play. But if the risk did prove tolerably low, the next question is what something like this might have to offer older or clinically vulnerable people, condemned under almost every other post-lockdown scenario to staying indoors indefinitely, even if the rest of us start edging back towards normality. The longer this goes on, the less plausible it seems to ask everyone from sprightly pensioners with busy lives to restless teens with chronic lung conditions simply to stay at home for a year or more. If an octogenarian who has lived a long and fulfilling life would rather take their chances with Covid-19 than never see their grandchildren again, is it morally justifiable in the interests of containing the virus to keep them at home, or must we eventually seek the safest way of letting human nature express itself?Loosening the lockdown in any way carries risks, and this would be no exception. While people tend to think of strangers as a threat, in an epidemic it’s those to whom we are closest from whom we have most to fear. One reason Italy’s death rate is thought to have been so high is that extended Italian families often live together or very nearby, allowing the disease to rip swiftly through several generations.Yet there are no risk-free ways out now, only ways of minimising the risk both to an overstretched NHS and to iniduals, and difficult conversations about precisely what we are all prepared to bear. Until more research is done, it’s impossible to know whether gradually expanding the quarantine circle of trust beyond immediate households should be part of that conversation. But there’s something about the idea that goes instinctively with the grain of how many people will eventually want to emerge from hiding not with a rush but gradually, nervously, and preferably in the company of those we love most.Boris Johnson might once have been attracted to the symbolism of lifting lockdown by the anniversary of VE Day, but who would be out dancing in fountains or kissing strangers in the street if it happened on 8 May? The virus will still be out there whenever we are allowed out again, and the physical caution learned over weeks of captivity may be surprisingly hard to overcome. Like hostages emerging blinking from a darkened cell, we may need longer than we think to acclimatise to the light."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f88d2fb32c06b5eb0043adc2e47cee9bc308bb66/0_47_3317_1991/master/3317.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f158e967f02e4bf6001771f33a03fab","title":"the guardian view on the covid 19 lockdown take the long view","story":"Politicians are under pressure to level with the public about the scale and length of lockdown restrictions. It is time to open upDowning Street’s daily press briefings on the coronavirus crisis have been taking place for several weeks. The format is now grindingly familiar. One day’s briefing varies little from the next. The reluctance of ministers and officials to stray from the agreed line is insulting and has caused increasing impatience, particularly as evidence has mounted of the terrible planning, procurement and supply distribution failures by the UK government before and during the ongoing outbreak.That daily rhythm was briefly broken on Wednesday evening by the government’s chief medical officer Chris Whitty. Departing from the usual cautious script in answer to a question, Prof Whitty made very clear that some of the government’s restrictive social measures are likely to remain in force until at least the end of 2020 and that it was “wholly unrealistic” to expect that life would return to normal soon. The Covid-19 virus was not going to disappear, so physical distancing and some lockdown measures were likely to continue for “really quite a long period of time”.Prof Whitty’s comments were important and sobering. They contained little precise detail, let alone dates, but, given the government’s self-imposed press briefing disciplines, they will not have been a piece of freelancing. It was, instead, a calculated intervention. The comments contained little that many people have not suspected for some time as they watch the continuing grim march of the virus. They nevertheless dashed any expectations that the lockdown will be largely eased or lifted when the current phase expires around 8 May. This was, in other words, a softening-up exercise as well as a reminder that an exit strategy from the lockdown is proving hard to devise, not least because of earlier failures to prepare.The manner and timing of the warning were important for at least three other reasons. The fact that Prof Whitty was chosen to deliver the sombre message means that ministers can continue to say they are deferring to the scientists, thus perhaps taking some of the pressure off the government for its mounting and increasingly serious list of policy failures. It also comes as, with the return of parliament, pressure mounts in parts of the Conservative party and elsewhere for the lockdown to be eased in early May in order to ease the pressures on business. Finally, it also meant that the UK government was able, by getting in first, to blunt some of the political impact of Thursday’s efforts by Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, to differentiate herself from the UK government approach by being more open about the need for restrictions to remain in place.The Scottish government’s paper on possible next steps is in fact broadly in line with Prof Whitty’s remarks. This reflects a reality, not always obvious from Ms Sturgeon’s adept press briefing performances, but attacked in a new report by the Scottish Centre on European Relations, that Covid-19 policy in Scotland continues to be broadly the same as in the UK as a whole. But the Scottish government paper is more truthful and proactive than its UK counterpart. It is therefore welcome, and not just in Scotland.The lifting of the lockdown, Ms Sturgeon makes clear, is likely to be phased and localised. There will be no return to the old normality for a long time, if at all. The reopening of schools, which many regard as an early priority for the sake of both children and their parents – and thus the economy – is likely to selective. Pubs and public events, likely to include sports, will be near the back of the queue. None of this will start soon, and there are no dates for any of it. The lockdown could be reimposed at short notice if virus cases spike upwards.This is the new reality that everyone is likely to have to face over the coming months. The effect on economic life is likely to be dire and long-lasting. And it will bear down most heavily on those who are least able to withstand either the material consequences or the disease itself. There can be little doubt now. We are in this for the long haul. It is time to be more honest about it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c65e7082d372cae3d2f205dc8fc4dd86e0d73ed/253_392_4750_2850/master/4750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=802f717e2f313241fd3d95bea4b02cbf","title":"the letdown a sweet patchwork of comforting stories for anyone feeling alone","story":"A comedy that never quite whinges about new motherhood, but is frank and self-deprecating about its difficultiesI know this is a column about shows you recommend watching in isolation, but I’m not sure if this one is comforting or excruciating right now. Maybe both! But if you’re self-isolating with small children, it’s almost definitely the latter.The Letdown is the story of a new mum, Audrey (Alison Bell), struggling to cope with her changed circumstances. As the primary caregiver to her daughter Stevie, she’s largely confined to her home. She feels inadequate, out of control, confused, and frustrated as her previous life – friends, parties, a semi-stable career! – slips out of grasp.“There’s no point whinging about what you’ve lost: muscle tone, sleep, freedom…” says Ambrose (Noni Hazlehurst), the stern leader of her local mothers’ group. The Letdown never quite whinges about Audrey’s new life, but it is frank and self-deprecating in a particularly Australian way about its difficulties.Created and written by Alison Bell and Sarah Scheller, The Letdown was originally developed as part of ABC TV’s Comedy Showroom in 2016. It then went on for a two-season run in collaboration with Netflix. In feeling and form, the show follows in the vein of another recent ABC gem turned international success story: Please Like Me. Bell and Scheller wrench humour from the tender and personal (the story stemmed from Scheller’s experiences at a mothers’ group). And through that, The Letdown spotlights the sometimes joyous, sometimes tortuous complexity of domestic and family life.This is a particular kind of domestic life – white, inner-city Sydney, well off enough to live in a family-owned home there – but the story is enriched by the other members of Audrey’s mothers’ group. There’s methodical business woman Ester (Sacha Horler), eager stay-at-home dad Ruben (Leon Ford), bogan mum of three Barbara (Celeste Barber), overachiever Sophie (Lucy Durack), young mum Georgia (Xana Tang), and queer musician Martha (Leah Vandenberg).These people are dealing with very different problems, but they’re united by many too. Over two seasons, The Letdown creates a sweet patchwork of their stories that feels like a big comforting doona for anyone (but specifically new mums) feeling overwhelmed or alone.I don’t have any children, but I am in the age range where people expect motherhood to be on your mind. I suppose it is. Each baby that pops into my news feed makes me wonder about the shape and feel of that world. How do you know if it’s what you really want? How do you reckon with the parts of yourself you leave behind?My mum has told me many times, “one day you’ll be a mother and you’ll understand”. It’s only ever said in moments of sacrifice.The Letdown is a rare look at those initial sacrifices that are mixed in with the joy, and the world that consistently takes them for granted. I can’t say it makes me want to push a human being out of my body tomorrow, but it would definitely give me a sense of humour about the horror of it all if and when I do.• The first season of The Letdown is now on Netflix"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/221184089edcef8051145e561b42cc906ecca4c6/0_174_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb516da9de49d0c8944e1b61fc5f2911","title":"insect numbers down 25 since 1990 global study finds","story":"Scientists say insects are vital and the losses worrying, with accelerating declines in Europe called ‘shocking’ Researchers said insects remained critically understudied in many regions, with little or no data from South America, south Asia and Africa. Rapid destruction of wild habitats in these places for farming and urbanisation is likely to be significantly reducing insect populations, they said.Insects are by far the most varied and abundant animals, outweighing humanity by 17 times, and are essential to the ecosystems humanity depends upon. They pollinate plants, are food for other creatures and recycle nature’s waste.The research, published in the journal Science, also examined how the rate of loss was changing over time. “Europe seems to be getting worse now – that is striking and shocking. But why that is, we don’t know,” said van Klink. In North America, the declines are flattening off, but at a low level.Elsewhere, data is much more sparse. “But we know from our results that the expansion of cities is bad for insects because every place used to be more natural habitat – it is not rocket science,” said van Klink. “This is happening in east Asia and Africa at a rapid rate. In South America, there is the destruction of the Amazon. There’s absolutely no question this is bad for insects and all the other animals there. But we just don’t have the data.”Van Klink said the research showed that insects were faring only slightly better in nature reserves than outside protected areas. “We found that very striking and a bit shocking – it means something’s going wrong there.”Losses of insects are driven by habitat destruction, pesticides and light pollution. The impact of the climate crisis was not clear in the research, despite obvious local examples. Van Klink said changes in heat and rain could harm some species while boosting others, even in the same location.But he highlighted another study showing that rising carbon dioxide levels are reducing the nutrients in plants and significantly cutting grasshopper abundances on prairies in Kansas, US. ”That is absolutely shocking, because that could be happening all over the world.”Prof Dave Goulson, of the University of Sussex, who was not involved in the new analysis, said: “People should be as concerned as ever about insects. It is great news that some aquatic insects seem to be increasing, probably from a very low level. But the bulk of insects are terrestrial and this new study confirms what was already clear: they have been declining for many decades.”Matt Shardlow, the head of the conservation charity Buglife, said: “Many insect species are threatened with extinction and this study shows insect abundance is also declining at an unsustainable rate. While the estimate in this study is lower than some, it is still very steep. Massive abundance declines in flying insects remains a developing ecological disaster.In a comment article in Science, Maria Dornelas, of the University of St Andrews, and Gergana Daskalova, of the University of Edinburgh, said the new study was the largest and most complete meta-analysis to date. “Embracing nuance allows us to balance accurate reporting of worrying losses with hopeful examples of wins,” they said.Van Klink said: “We definitely have a lot of reason for concern, but I don’t think it’s too late. The increase in freshwater species makes us at least hopeful that if we put the right legislation in place, we can reverse these trends.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/722bc0ce96f29a8ed2ef8ec6401aeb581b4f6a71/0_299_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5cb45028a7fe99396e9d359de629845b","title":"is old yeast ok the 17 rules of expiry dates from eggs to meat to oils","story":"Use-by dates are a food-safety matter so you should always take them seriously. Here’s a guide to where you do – and definitely don’t – have some leewayThis was, of course, all overshadowed, by the coronavirus outbreak but the use-by date controversy has never been more up to date. The cook, author and campaigner Jack Monroe runs ad hoc advice sessions called Lockdown Larder on Twitter, and says: “Since I’ve been doing it, by a country mile the most-asked question I’ve had is: ‘I’ve got this yeast, it went out of date two months ago, can I use it? I’ve got these sardines, they went out of date a year ago, can I use them?’ People want someone they perceive to be an expert to reassure them. As a species, we seem to have lost the ability to trust our own senses.”This gets to the core of the matter. If you want a blanket rule for everyone, the use-by date is that rule. I can only tell you what I would eat. If it happens to be the same as Theresa May (who famously admitted to scraping the mould off jam), that’s just coincidence.Erik Millstone, emeritus professor of science policy at the University of Sussex, lays out the ground rules: ignore sell-by dates. “Those are a guidance by the retailers for the retailers, so they can manage their stock. The indications concerning food safety, particularly microbiological food safety, that’s use-by dates.” But are all use-by dates created equal?Eggs, strictly speaking, don’t have a use-by date but a best-before-end (BBE), which is mostly to do with quality and taste rather than safety. Either way, this is a hill I’m prepared to die on: dates are irrelevant to eggs, because of the float test. Drop the egg in a glass of water. If it floats to the surface, it’s definitely off. If it sits flat on its side, it’s definitely fresh. If it sits vertically, it’s somewhere between fresh and off (I would still eat it). A fully off egg will also smell disgusting, but you can save yourself that trauma by conducting this test.The sulphurous smell of an off egg triggers a useful disgust mechanism, because the bacterium causing it – Pseudomonas – can be injurious. Salmonella is far more dangerous, being undetectable, but British hens are inoculated.If a bread past its BBE date is mouldy, or smells of mould, don’t eat it. Don’t just chop off the mouldy bit, because there is a twilight when mould spores are present but not yet visible. Mould on bread isn’t the most dangerous of the fungi, but it’s still revolting.I remember being astonished to read (in Delia) that you should do a complete spice overhaul every year, because they won’t taste as good. As I have spices that are older than my children this seemed extremely wasteful. There are spices that most cooks won’t get through in a year (za’atar) unless you live with Yotam Ottolenghi. But Delia’s right, if you want them to last longer, buy them whole and grind yourself to order, or go back in time and store them in brown rather than clear glass.Ah, this is where things get interesting. Millstone says: “Some of the compounds formed from mould can be seriously toxic, especially aflatoxins, which can be carcinogenic.” These are found on mouldy grain and nuts.You can’t buy dangerous grains and nuts (because of that blasted EU), but you should take very seriously the use-by date on what you have bought. There is no meaningful trade-off between risk now and cancer later. It’s not like pharmaceuticals it’s just a bar snack.Some time before anything goes mouldy, it may go a bit grey (if it started out green) or just a murkier version of itself (if it started out red). This is plain pigment oxidisation and is not dangerous, though it is a bit unappetising – if the fat has oxidised, you will be able to smell it.Monroe raises the stakes here: “I’ve personally used yeast that is 10 years out of date. But it’s not been opened, and was stored away from direct light in cool conditions. It didn’t rise as well as normal yeast would. If you’re using old yeast, I would always recommend using 1.5 times the amount the recipe states, leave it for an extra hour, and if you’re really running low on flour, make a quarter batch, then if it doesn’t rise, or doesn’t go so well, you can work it into a soda bread and you’re not going to waste half a bag of what is currently quite a precious resource.”Baking powder and bicarbonate of soda typically have shelf lives of one to two years, but storage is more important than numbers, and there is a school of thought that says bicarb lasts for ever. Yup, for ever.These are “particularly vulnerable to bacterial spoilage,” Millstone says, “and if it smells off, it’s definitely off.” However, some forms of spoilage are smellier than others, so just because it doesn’t smell doesn’t mean it’s safe. “If I had a piece of chicken one day past its use-by date,” Millstone continues, I wouldn’t simply barbecue it and eat it, but I might put it in a casserole and cook it at a high temperature for quite a long time.”Vulnerability to rottenness is partly about surface area – how much the meat has come into contact with the outside world, and how much of it is subject to direct heat while you’re cooking. This is why mince is such a minefield, because it has a huge surface area, and if you’re cooking a burger medium rare, the middle won’t have been thoroughly cooked. A whole bird has a much smaller surface area. Game birds are a subtle enterprise, the window between how it’s supposed to smell and “off” being so narrow. It’s eater-beware in this case.Salt, naturally, has a preservative effect, and the sniff and overall appearance test should work with things such as salami. These things have a pretty good shelf life to begin with, and are very low effort (you don’t have to cook them, you just have to pop them in your mouth). So there is something to be said for using your memory rather than your judgment. Eat them before the use-by date, and you won’t have to play ham-roulette.The food safety scene is united on this – nothing with mould should be consumed, except where it has been introduced deliberately (blue cheese). It does, however, seem a bit absurd, if you have a jam with a bit of mould on, stuffed with sugar so you know it’s fine underneath, to have to chuck the whole lot out. Millstone is slightly forgiving on this. “If there’s a bit of mould on the top surface of jam that can be safely removed, then the jam lower down might well be safe. But if the entire top surface is covered in mould, you should discard it.” Pesto will taste rank if it’s mouldy as pine nuts go rancid very fast.Again, frozen, tinned and dried food gets a BBE date rather than a use-by date. You can sail past the BBE on dried fruit by as much as a year, though the higher the water content, the less time you have – figs and dates won’t last as long as currants and raisins. Do yourself a favour, though, and taste these things if they are very old. If they no longer taste of themselves, that’s just a waste of calories.Certain oils (walnut, sesame) seem to go off much faster than others (vegetable, olive oil) but this is usually because we don’t use them fast enough. The smell and taste of a rancid oil is subtle but very insistent, and you can easily ruin a whole dish with a very small amount of it. Don’t give it the benefit of the doubt smelling it, tasting it, smelling it again, not wanting to chuck it out because it was expensive. It’s much more wasteful to ruin more food than to throw it away.We think of these as forever foods, but by the end of the best-before date, they will be tough and won’t taste as good. Vexingly, they will have toughened at different rates within the packet, so it will be impossible to adjust your cooking times for toughness without some of them going mushy. Stick with the guidelines.Your real enemy is the weevil. Some people say just sift them out, others (Millstone) remind us that you don’t know what else those bugs have been crawling over.Hard cheeses are less vulnerable to mould and bacteria than soft ones, since their higher salt content has a protective effect. All bets are off for cheeses in which the mould is deliberate. Those are delicious. I would happily saw the mouldy end off a cheddar and eat the rest. Milk has the fabulous trait of smelling awful – and shortly after that, separating – to warn you that it’s off. Yoghurt is the great unknown (I have never met anybody who takes yoghurt use-by dates seriously). Monroe will eat a yoghurt a week after its expiration. I once found one at the bottom of my daughter’s school bag, decided it would probably be fine, and it exploded. So don’t listen to me (on this one occasion).These new fangled milks will keep in pantry conditions for several months, then for seven days in the fridge. There hasn’t been a huge amount of consumer experimentation the best anecdotal evidence is that they lose their flavour, rather than becoming disgusting. Oat milk is lower in fat and higher in sugar, so will last longer. Almond milk won’t have a very strong smell, even if it’s off, so taste it tentatively.Best-before dates on crisps are so long, and crisps themselves so delicious, that it’s actually quite hard to find any that are out of date. Monroe got some two-year-out-of-date Doritos from a vending machine the other day (“Were they the best Doritos I’ve ever had? Probably not, but they were fine”) I had some Quavers this morning that should have been eaten by February. They are loaded with salt and preservatives. Probably the worst they can bring is disappointment, of not being crunchy enough.The best-before dates on cans range between three and five years from purchase, but this is essentially a way of saying “for ever, all things being equal” – if you’re dealing in units of half a decade, you’re not really talking about the food perishing, but rather the tin. Acidic foods such as tinned tomatoes can attack the can from the inside. Otherwise, rust, dents, any attack on its structural integrity can interfere with its powers of preservation. If you have a tin with a dent in it, even if you can clearly remember the time you dropped it, it’s still better not to eat it. I once had some Swedish anchovies that swelled up like a bloater fish. I don’t know how that happened, but I didn’t try to eat them.Jack Monroe’s Good Food for Bad Days is out at the end of May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74b02fae99c19e5a8ec7809eba0d4c52a0cef1ac/0_2120_5398_3239/master/5398.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08fe963685ee82b4a9d90db120c289de","title":"nigel slater simple store cupboard recipes for lockdown","story":"Five of his favourite recipes that offer comfort and familiarity, cut down on shopping and make use of ingredients you might already have to handIt is taking forever to do the food shopping. At first, finding a time when the queues will be at their shortest joining the queue, suitably distancing myself from the next shopper, then, when finally inside the shop, trying to avoid getting close to others mulling over which piece of Parmesan to buy. And then, I start all over again at the next shop.To reduce my trips to the absolute minimum (I’ve been taking lockdown very seriously) I have been raiding my own store-cupboard at home and hunkering down on the carbs I have in store. I have probably eaten more beans, pasta and rice during lockdown than I did in the whole of last year. But that has been a good thing, reminding myself of dishes I may not have cooked in a while stuff that might initially feel a little unseasonal, yet is strangely just what I need in times such as these. Much-loved recipes, cheap ingredients and food that offers a sense of comfort and familiarity.I have dug out a number of archive recipes that have fitted in quite neatly with this new way of life. All rely very much on what is in the cupboard, with a few bits and bobs from the shops: a butternut squash cooked on the hob with butter beans and thyme some crisp cakes of chickpeas and spinach (the greens came in my veg box but I could have used frozen) onions with miso butter that we ate with rice and a cheddar and potato mash that we’ve tucked into with sausages, and on another occasion, with asparagus.I can’t find plain flour for love nor money, so I have been baking apples with marmalade and the dregs of the sherry bottle instead, and yesterday made a version where I mashed the apples after cooking and stirred them into whipped cream to make a version of fruit fool. I may be in lockdown, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to do without pudding.Any gold-fleshed squash is suitable for cooking in stock. It is a good idea to brown the pieces first, so the caramelised notes lend a sweet depth to the broth. I use butter beans for their beefy texture, but haricot beans or cannellini are suitable here, too.Potatoes, especially the large baking variety, have been a godsend during lockdown. I have been making mountains of mash, very often with cooked greens or chopped, crisply fried bacon folded in. A great favourite has been this one, with crumbled cheese and roast shallots.Once the cakes have rested and firmed in the fridge, they should be lifted carefully into the sizzling oil using a palette knife, then left to form a thin, golden crust on the bottom before you attempt to turn them. Fiddling with them as they cook, although tempting, will result in them breaking up in the pan.Roast onions, bronzed by the oven, are one of those side dishes I have elevated to that of a main course, either by stuffing them with goat’s cheese and thyme or by serving them with a sauce, rice and a crisp accompaniment. The sweetness of their outer layers is a contrast to the deep, savoury quality of miso, and with a bed of brown rice this becomes a most satisfying dinner.There is something pleasing about basting food as it cooks, about spooning the cooking juices over it as your supper bakes. I do this two or three times during the 45 minutes or so it take the apples to bake. The sauce will thicken to a jammy consistency on the hob later."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eea0971523c9c73411c9933b350bc0cc1b0debe/0_288_8088_4856/master/8088.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6a9ecf2d615ed98f8516ec1345fb2ad","title":"bundesliga return in may now looks inevitable but fans are far from happy","story":"Games could resume next month with just over 300 people in the ground and strict safety measures in placeThe historic is about to become the everyday in Germany. As it stands, the derby between Borussia Mönchengladbach and Cologne – the last Bundesliga match played before the shutdown – is the only Geisterspiel (“ghost game”, without fans) ever to have taken place in the top flight. When elite German football resumes at some point in May, as now seems inevitable, this unique spectacle will become just the tip of an echoey iceberg.The Bundesliga is set to become the first elite European league to restart following the Covid-19 pandemic shutdown, and the chief executive of the German league (DFL), Christian Seifert, has said the league is ready to get going as soon as 9 May. Though it seems the governing body’s preference was to begin a week or two later, it has made it clear it will be guided by “what the politicians decide”.Angela Merkel is scheduled to meet the 16 leaders of the country’s federal states on 30 April. The outcome of those talks will be crucial to the Bundesliga having a plan that can be rolled out with national consensus, so we will have clarity sooner rather than later. In terms of how, rather than when football will return, we are most of the way there already.A DFL task force has already been put into action, led by the German national team physician, Dr Tim Meyer. It will plan every last detail of safety and hygiene, leading on from the clubs’ training programmes into matchdays. For the games, there will be strict controls, with 322 people present in the stadium. This includes 98 in the “interior” (players, coaching and medical staff), 115 in the stands (including media) and 109 more within the stadium perimeter (security, TV production staff).Press conferences will be held virtually and sinks will be installed at regular intervals in working areas. The task force has also designed an 18-point plan to cover best practice on away trips, which includes banning players from communal buffets or wellness areas, directing them not to touch elevator buttons – elbows have been suggested as an alternative to the index finger – and even designating an optimal temperature and humidity level for the players’ rooms.Seifert struck a conciliatory tone in his press conference which followed Thursday’s meeting on how to proceed. The German league’s chief said he understood those who would oppose the DFL’s drive to resume, even if for “purely emotional reasons because it just doesn’t feel right”. At the same time, he didn’t attempt to duck the financial motivations behind the current plans. The resumption, Seifert said starkly, was “the only way to keep the Bundesliga and the 2 Bundesliga alive”.Some have called this scaremongering, particularly given recent progress made in talks between the DFL and the Bundesliga’s domestic TV rights holders. The season’s final tranche of €304m (£265m) due had been in doubt after games stopped, but an agreement appeared to take the pressure off. The main rights holders, Sky, and public broadcasters ZDF and ARD agreed to pay the bulk of the outstanding payment, albeit with a slight delay. Seifert also confirmed on Thursday that a deal had been reached with two other broadcast partners, Dazn and Eurosport.It is the lack of gate receipts that will leave clubs feeling the pinch. Schalke wrote to their fans a few weeks ago and asked them to consider waiving refunds for the remainder of their season tickets which they won’t be able to use. This was to ensure the continued “financial health” of the club fans who do so have been offered a special commemorative jersey in return. This is the club with the seventh-highest average attendance in European football – and the presence of Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich in the six above them underlines just how much matchday is part of the Bundesliga, financially as well as in terms of personality.The DFL’s conservative estimate was that four top-flight sides and up to half of the 18-team second ision faced the possibility of bankruptcy if the season didn’t restart by June. The hope is that stadiums will be full again next season, with the Bundesliga reclaiming its full allure. Seifert is keen to have clubs take responsibility for future-proofing, imploring them to not include gate receipts for “January, February or March” in their budgets going forward, in case a second wave of Covid-19 requires a stoppage next season.Many fans are deeply unhappy about the prospect of the Bundesliga resuming in empty stadiums. Fanszenen Deutschlands, a nationwide union of ultra groups, is no stranger to criticising German football’s business model and didn’t hold back when rejecting the whole Geisterspiele concept. “It’s an insult to society,” the group said in a statement, “and in particular to those fighting Covid-19 on a daily basis. Professional football has long been sick and should still be in quarantine.”Seifert encouraged clubs to open dialogue with those supporters but once again made the governing body’s stance clear. In March, a few thousand Gladbach fans gathered outside Borussia-Park to celebrate their derby win, on the same night PSG supporters congregated at the Parc des Princes after their Champions League win against Dortmund. Seifert suggested that mass gatherings of fans could lead to matches being abandoned, with a 2-0 defeat imposed on the offending club.With swathes of the continent, and the world, eager to be reunited with football even on limited terms, the heightened prospect of the Bundesliga’s return might be beguiling. Yet beyond the headlines of imminent dates, more compromise on all sides is still required to make it work out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95e3bb9e4f7cbc227a35156927a5e8ff39a17cca/23_137_3400_2039/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f9c71626b9ace29f8059c0d03b2139c","title":"uefa european leagues to determine placings on sporting merit","story":"Uefa has confirmed national leagues will not be banned from European competition if they cancel their seasons and must decide for themselves how to determine final placings “based on sporting merit”.The emergency rules were announced after a meeting of Uefa’s executive committee and mark a stark shift in approach from European football’s governing body. The top line remains a “strong recommendation” to finish the season, and even suggests a preference for adopting a different format, such as a play-off, before cancelling. But as the coronavirus crisis deepens there is an acceptance that national competitions – with Scotland and the Netherlands foremost among them – are facing extraordinary circumstances.Uefa has laid out two primary conditions under which it would accept the abandonment of a league. The first would involve being instructed to do so by a government, which is the case in the Netherlands the second is “insurmountable economic problems”. Uefa’s announcement cites a request from Scottish football authorities for clarity on the rules. The Scottish Premiership is now expected to bring its season to an end.In a statement Uefa said: “The ideal scenario, should the pandemic situation permit it, is to have the currently suspended domestic competitions completed ... in their original format. Should this outcome not be possible, it would be preferable that suspended domestic competitions would restart with a different format in a manner which would still facilitate clubs to qualify on sporting merit.”The statement goes on, however: “While using best efforts to complete the domestic competitions, national associations andor leagues might have legitimate reasons to prematurely terminate their domestic competitions.”Uefa then requests that, if terminated leagues are to submit clubs to European competition in the 2021-22 season, they do so “based on sporting merit”, determining final placings “on objective, transparent and non-discriminatory principles”. While leaving open some flexibility, the recommendation would seem to encourage a solution where an incomplete league table is organised on a points-per-game basis.Uefa says it reserves the right to refuse nations or clubs to compete in the Champions League and Europa League if these criteria have not been met. It stipulates a further reason for termination that may be acceptable namely if it has been done on “the basis of any other legitimate public health reasons”.This final clause will be interpreted by some as leaving open the possibility for even the biggest leagues to stop their seasons should the pandemic not allow a safe resumption of competition.Uefa also announced it would be advancing €70m (£61.2m) from its “national team competition revenues” to clubs which released players for the European qualifiers and the Nations League. It was also confirmed that the men’s European Championship will retain the name Euro 2020 despite having been rescheduled for the following year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/101846dcb4d1599fd14a421c040b692ec3c9631f/0_0_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8a0fd4f1344cd1adcc17474d112113c","title":"calling her lifts my spirits three parents on isolation away from their children","story":"As the UK remains in lockdown, parents share their stories about how they’re connecting with their children via technology …With much of the world in lockdown, staying connected with our loved ones has never been more important. Whether we’re checking in with a call, keeping ourselves entertained by taking part in online pub quizzes, or updating the family WhatsApp with our latest baking attempts, we have a burning desire to keep in touch. Our home broadband has gone from “nice to have” to the lifeline between us and the outside world.For some mums and dads who find themselves self-isolating away from their young children, this lifeline is critical. Here, three parents describe how they are managing to stay connected with their families from afar …Rosie: ‘I haven’t seen my son in four weeks’ “Dropping my son off with his father without knowing when I’m going to see him again was the most impossible thing I’ve ever had to do. And that feeling hasn’t lessened over all these weeks of self-isolation. My son is only three years old he’s so young. I feel ready to run out of here and scoop him up at any moment – to hell with it all.“I have to remind myself constantly why I have to take self-isolation so seriously. I’ve got bad asthma. So when my doctor advised that I stay indoors for 12 weeks, I decided it would be best for my son if he was with his dad, who has lots of outdoor space. We broke up in October, so I was only just getting used to the separation. And now this.“It’s been four weeks already, which is the longest I’ve ever been away from my son. FaceTime is essential, but it can be incredibly painful as well – I have to be positive because naturally I just want to burst into tears. I call him on my laptop as it has a bigger screen and his face is the normal size. At the end of the conversation he’ll hug the phone he’s using.“He recently showed me that he can now put his own socks on and told me that he’s being ‘independent’. He’s learned quite a few new words – I’m really proud of him. He’s also been collecting sticks and stones as presents for me when we’re reunited.“We talk at breakfast and dinner – it’s like how we used to sit around the family table, and he finds it entertaining to try to feed me bits of his food through the camera.“We’ve also had some family group calls – we had a lovely one with my sister and her son, my ex-husband and my son, and my dad and my stepmum. My son was playing the keyboard, and his cousin, who has just turned two, was dancing. It was so good!”Leo: ‘I had to isolate away from my daughter when I became ill’“When I started to feel ill a few weeks ago, with what I assume was coronavirus, my 12-year-old daughter was with her mum so it was easy for me to self-isolate.“As the illness took hold, I could do nothing but be in my bed. One bright part of the day, though, was FaceTiming my daughter, which isn’t something we did much previously. My ex and I share equal custody, so I’m used to seeing her every few days.“We’ve WhatsApped each other a lot, too. That way I got to check she was OK, what she was up to and, of course, my knowledge of emojis became fairly impressive.“My symptoms are now subsiding, but we feel it’s best that she stays at her mum’s until I’m completely clear, so the video calls have been such a help. We don’t have to talk every day, but knowing I can see her lifts my spirits. The distinctive sound of the FaceTime ringtone, and then seeing her face and that she looks so well, and isn’t bored or scared, makes this all much easier for me.“It has been very hard to be away from her especially because we don’t know when this is going to end. Several years ago I went to Brazil to work for a few weeks, but this will be the longest I haven’t been with my daughter. I know she is OK, though, and I know that right now she is in the best place with her fantastic mum, and in a wonderful home.“Loneliness, of course, comes into it, but weirdly with everyone in the same boat, you can sort of move away from thoughts of pure isolation. Knowing my daughter is only a video call away helps me so much.“We chat about what we’re doing, laugh about how mad we’re going, and I can put her mind at rest about any questions she has right now. We give each other a kiss on the camera, but we can also just sit in relative silence. She is painting a lot and during one call when I was ill and quite weak, she just got on with that while I watched and relaxed. That was lovely.”Mark: ‘We haven’t told my daughter I’m back in the UK yet’“I travel a lot for work and had recently spent a month in New Zealand away from my family – but when it began to look like everything was shutting down I decided to catch a flight back to the UK so I wouldn’t be stranded.“After discussing it with my wife, we decided that it would be best if I didn’t come straight back to the family home and – as a precaution – I would spend two weeks in isolation. I was very lucky that a good friend had moved in with his girlfriend during lockdown and he kindly offered me his flat to stay in.“However, this meant telling my little girl, who is seven years old, that I was still away. Although she doesn’t totally understand everything about what is going on, she knows enough that she’s been scared of things she’s heard on the news and fearful of us getting ill. So my wife and I decided we didn’t want to worry her even more.“Every day I FaceTime her as I normally would when I’m away, and it’s been a real lifeline for me to be able to see how she’s coping and reassure her that I’ll be home soon. We even watched a film together and her mum made her popcorn just like when we have family movie nights. Doing my best to pretend that everything is normal is the right thing for her, and it helps me cope with this awful situation too.“It’s really difficult to be away from my wife and daughter, especially when this is the time you want to be close to the people you love most in the world. Hopefully one day, when this is all over, we’ll be able to laugh together about how Daddy was hiding in a flat around the corner when she thought I was calling from New Zealand.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedWe know that now, more than ever, it is important for you to stay connected to your family.That’s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.

Très bon.Forest: App store, £1.99 Play store, freeAs every parent knows, the biggest problem with secondary school children isn’t that they don’t have enough work to do, it’s getting them off TikTokFortniteYouTube long enough to get it done. The idea here is simple: the app has a picture of a tree and the longer they stay on their school task, the taller the tree will grow. If they pick up their phone to check Snapchat? Yup, its days are numbered.

Obsessively rearranging your groceries by best-before date. Binge-watching old episodes of Terry and June. Blankly staring at the forks in your cutlery drawer wondering why they have four prongs and not three.Instead, the past few weeks have shown that being shut away could be making us more connected with each other. Thanks to strong internet networks and an array of digital apps and video communication software, we’re spending more quality time with loved ones, rehabilitating old relationships and forging new ones. Indeed, a recent study by Channel Mum found a quarter of British people now talk with neighbours they previously ignored. In short? Being confined to quarters is helping us rediscover a new sense of community.Every day brings more inspiring and creative digital gatherings, whether it’s quarantine quizzes, online aperitivo or friends slogging up their staircases thousands of times in a bid to conquer a virtual Everest.

Taking capacity from commuter hotspots such as Waterloo to expand capacity in the suburbs is one way networks such as Vodafone are adjusting their behaviour. With internet connectivity remaining robust, here’s some inventive ways to escape the lockdown funk and embrace webcameraderie.The shutters might be closed on the nation’s pubs, but that hasn’t stopped people excitedly cheersing each other in brilliantly-named virtual pubs such as The Stay Inn and The Quarant Inn. Sequestered merrymakers have also been improvising cocktails from dusty bottles of crème de menthe and kumquat-flavoured vodka found lurking in their drinks cupboards (see the #quarantini hashtag on Instagram). For many, these sofa-based happy hours are preferable to the real thing: after all, there’s no five-deep bar queues, plus you can do a covert French exit by pretending to have accidentally snagged your socks on some cables.Online rendezvous: The Red (On)Lion: a cyber pub from real ale aficionados Camra.

An expedition team of 30 climbing friends in the UK recently clambered up a virtual Mount Everest – all 8,848m of it – by trudging up stairs, steps and ladders within their own homes (often kitted up in full mountaineering gear). Elsewhere, tourist attractions such as the Louvre, British Museum and New York’s Guggenheim now offer 360-degree videos and livestreaming on their websites.

On ourselves, our relationships and what’s important to us. For some of us, that means reaching out to old friends, or healing old wounds with people we once thought we’d never speak to again. And in a way, the tech that helps us reconnect makes repairing those relationships easier: the screen gives us an element of safety, yet we can tap directly into those emotional connections we need to get us through this crisis.Here, three people who found isolation has had a positive effect on their relationships share their experiences – from building bridges, to creating the foundations for better communication, and reconnecting with family members they haven’t spoken to in years …Emma*: ‘Coronavirus gave me a reason to reach out to my brother’“I’d always had a good relationship with my brother, but it came crashing down last Christmas when my family discovered he’d been keeping his gambling addiction from us. He’d even taken money from Mum, and I was upset that he could put her through so much stress – I just couldn’t bring myself to speak to him. But after chatting to Mum over the past couple of weeks and hearing that he’d been helping her with food deliveries while she’s been in isolation, I decided to reach out. I sent him a text first and then he called me and we chatted about coronavirus and how we’ve been coping – a few days later, he FaceTimed me and gave me a tour of his new flat that I’ve never visited. I’d wanted to reach out to him before, but I was struggling to know how, so while lockdown is a very weird situation, it gave us both an excuse to push our differences to one side.“I also realised that life is too short – if my mum could move past what had happened, so could I. In fact, I’m probably speaking to him more now than I ever did before.”Michael: ‘Lockdown made me realise what’s important’“My ex-partner and I split a year ago and we share a young daughter, but our relationship has been really rocky ever since we broke up. We’d fight all the time and nasty words would be fired back and forth at each other over text message. But when the lockdown happened, it really made me take a step back and think about what’s important.“I reached out to her via text and also sent her some money for petrol, as she is driving our daughter between our two houses during this time – I wanted to make sure she knew I appreciated that she was helping me to see my daughter. It has felt like a real turning point for us and our relationship and it’s a really positive outcome from a situation that is out of our control. Now my daughter is with me and I’ve been sending my ex-partner pictures and we’ve been having civil conversations. Without this happening, I don’t know if we’d have ever reached this point.”Jo: ‘I’m connecting with family members I haven’t spoken to in years’“We have an extended family WhatsApp group made up of the descendants of my grandparents, both of whom sadly passed away recently. We used to use it every so often to share pictures from when people visited them, but over the years as inidual families grew, and as my grandparents got more frail, we didn’t have the same opportunities to gather together. And for some of the family, my only contact was an annual Christmas card. Since everyone has been staying at home for the past few weeks, though, the group has blown up with almost daily messages – pictures of the great-grandchildren doing their home school work, baking or learning to ride bikes without stabilisers in abandoned car parks.“My mum and dad both work in the NHS, with more than 60 years of service between them, so everyone shared videos from the 8pm clap for the NHS in recognition. And my brother, who’s a musician, livestreamed a gig on Facebook and lots of the family who’ve never had the opportunity to see him play before got to watch. It’s really lovely to feel connected to everyone, particularly as the two people that held us all together are no longer here.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedFamily has rarely felt more precious, nor has staying in touch with each other and the world.

One of our best friends lives right behind us, so we have daily balcony conversations with them I’m very grateful for that.When I’m doing handstands, that’s the time for taking in other people’s music. I do a hand-balancing class almost every day, and I feel comfortable holding a handstand. Right now, my best is a minute and a half. It’s a symbol to me of the impossible, my own therapy practice about trying to break through mental constructs there are some things I feel confident in and some things where it feels as if there’s so far to go still. In the last two years, I went through a lot of health struggles and was burned out from touring. I struggled with depression, chemical imbalances, mental fog, ulcers – a whole slew of things. Through lots of different practices those all got healed, but any time I had depression, if I just got upside down it was like an instant fix.There’s an artist who goes under the name Green-House. I like all of their albums but I’ve been listening to one called Six Songs for Invisible Gardens. It’s not too upbeat and it feels like it provides steady movement to whatever you’re doing – it feels very light and uplifting.Mira O’Reilly’s Hockets for Two Voices is really beautiful. It’s just voice and it’s a study of hockets, which is like passing parts between voices. It has an energy that is really evocative – like it’s opening up a novel thinking space while I’m training.Another one is Danzindan​-​Pojidon by Inoyama Land. It has a very fantastical sound, so it helps me feel something magical is about to happen. I’m always looking for music that isn’t going to get stuck in my head, that’s just going to assist movement. Upbeat 44 rhythms are super challenging for me – not that I don’t appreciate them, but it just doesn’t work for my thinking pattern I’m looking for music that feels as if it’s moving you forward in a steady motion. I also listen to a lot of mbira music from Zimbabwe, which I find on a website called mbira.org – you can’t really find it on streaming sites. My brain really responds well to polyrhythms and the site is where I learn the most about complex polyrhythms and melody stacking.I love Caribou’s new album – though I don’t listen to that type of music on a daily basis, because things get stuck in my head really easily. I’m very connected to internal listening that’s how I write music. So if I have things that are stuck in my head then it can be really challenging – I have to do exercises to get it out.I’m teaching people how to create music. Sometimes people feel really blocked creatively and we work through that, or sometimes I do sessions where I guide people through their subconscious. I have remixes and commissions to work on, too, and I’m doing livestreams for fun. I’m also writing a book on somatic hearing, which is about the experience of receiving sound and the frequencies felt in the bones and in the muscular system. My husband and I started a label imprint called Touch the Plants and we have a book and tape combo coming that’s a collaboration between the poet Rob Moss Wilson and my husband, who goes under the name Cool Maritime. It’s like tiny pieces of wisdom, tiny poems over ambient soundscapes.I’ve also been watching Leaving Records’ livestreams on Saturdays, and I have a lot of friends who will go live on Instagram, spur of the moment. Each one feels so special and so helpful. I haven’t felt lonely during this lockdown.• Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith’s album The Mosaic of Transformation is released on 15 May on Ghostly International"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cffb11583d34b30fd3e8d8f408e8e24edd001cd0/283_101_1844_1106/master/1844.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fe20d5cdc8437d42d917bd4934134e0","title":"the rolling stones release living in a ghost town first original music since 2012","story":"Mick Jagger says new single will ‘resonate through the times we’re living in’ and references coronavirus with the lyric: ‘Life was so beautiful, then we all got locked down’The Rolling Stones have released their first original music since 2012, a new – and rather apocalyptic – single called Living in a Ghost Town.Mick Jagger said the band were “recording some new material before the lockdown and there was one song we thought would resonate through the times that we’re living in right now. We’ve worked on it in isolation. And here it is.”Keith Richards said: “We cut this track well over a year ago in LA for a new album, an ongoing thing, and then shit hit the fan. Mick and I decided this one really needed to go to work right now and so here you have it.”A moody, typically strutting track, its lyrics seem to reference the coronavirus crisis, in the lines: “Life was so beautiful  Then we all got locked down … Please let this be over  Stuck in a world without end.”Elsewhere, Jagger sings of chaos (“Glasses were all smashing  Trumpets were all screaming”) and societal collapse:Preachers were all preachingCharities beseechingPoliticians dealingThieves were happy stealingWidows were all weepingThere’s no beds left for us to sleep inAlways had the feelingIt would all come tumbling down.Last Sunday, the isolated band performed together You Can’t Always Get What You Want via four separate video links for One World: Together at Home, a concert to benefit charities and the World Health Organisation, co-organised by Lady Gaga. A 79-song album version of the eight-hour event has since been released.The Rolling Stones’ most recent original material came out as part of the 2012 best-of compilation Grrr!, which featured two new songs: Doom and Gloom, and One More Shot. They have since released an album of blues covers, Blue and Lonesome, in 2016, and another hits compilation, Honk, in 2019. Their last album of original material was 2005’s A Bigger Bang.The quartet are approaching the milestone of 60 years in the business, after Jagger and Richards formed the group in 1962.Despite a combined age of 302, they still frequently perform live, and have toured each year since 2012. Their No Filter tour began in September 2017, with the next leg originally scheduled for north America in early May. The band postponed it due to the coronavirus crisis, apologising and saying they were “hugely disappointed”. Replacement dates have not yet been scheduled.Speaking in more depth about Living In a Ghost Town to Zane Lowe on Apple Music, Jagger said he originally wrote the song in 10 minutes, but made minor rewrites in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.He also sympathised with those suffering: “It’s 20 million people lost their jobs completely for something that’s nothing to do with them at all. And also the less money you have, the more worries you have. So for lots of people, it’s really tough. I mean, I have friends and they live in really small apartments in a big city and they don’t have anywhere to go and they’ve lost their job. I’m very, very lucky and I’m very aware how lucky I am, but not everyone’s as lucky as me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e46285aebe27b12c15ed82b49e1f74de18862520/0_96_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=486f46441ef4bb24e9cbe9c47eccda36","title":"toddler hears via magic of the internet inflight meals and a 36 hour bike ride","story":"Girl has implant switched on remotely, charity saves unused meals, and boy, 12, completes epic ride for NHSIn these challenging times, joy can be found in the most unusual places.

Audiologists at the University of Southampton created a link over the internet in order to turn the device on for Margarida Cibrao-Roque, the first time such a procedure has been carried out in the UK.Professor Helen Cullington, of the university’s auditory implant service, conducted the switch-on from her home, linking remotely with the toddler’s parents at their home in Camberley, Surrey.She said: “Usually we do the switch-on of a cochlear implant at our clinic at the university, but with some technical creativity and some advice from colleagues in Australia, we were able to do everything necessary over the internet.“The session went really well and everyone was thrilled with the outcome.”The child’s mother, Joana Cibrao, said: “The Southampton team were amazing. I cannot praise them enough really, the effort of the team - they were just brilliant and they made it happen.

First, he got coronavirus, and almost certainly came back to work far sooner than was good for him. Next, he was just about the only minister prepared to do more than mutter platitudes and put his neck on the line with a target of 100,000 tests per day. Then he discovered he was being set up as the fall guy for the inevitable public inquiry following a series of off-the-record briefings by Classic Dom.So it’s no wonder Hancock now looks totally done in. All his old Tigger bounce and enthusiasm has gone: he is the Duracell bunny left to run on fumes, barely able to put one foot in front of the other. He has also aged visibly. Where there used to be a child-like polished sheen, there are now traces of lines on his face. Give it another week and he’ll have to hand in his student railcard.Yet on and on he goes. On Tuesday he was put in charge of the daily press briefing, on Wednesday he had to do a 45-minute ministerial statement in the Commons, and then here he was back in Downing Street on Thursday to front up the government’s daily press conference again. While many other ministers have gone missing for much of the past two months – TV box sets to watch, nails to paint – Matt has consistently turned up for work. There’s no doubt about how much he cares: I just wonder how much longer he can sustain it.His problem is that integrity and competence don’t always go hand in hand. Because there seldom seems to be any correlation between what he says and what actually takes place. “We now have the capacity to do 51,000 tests per day,” he said, blithely brushing past the fact that the actual number of daily tests taking place was about 20,000. That’s another 80,000 a day to reach by this time next week. Talk of capacity has long since stopped fooling people.Hancock, though, is still waiting on a miracle. Having insisted that all NHS staff and social care workers could already get tests – something that will be news to the many hundreds of thousands who have found themselves unable to get the tests they need – Matt went truly exponential. Now, he declared, 10 million key workers and their families would also be able to get tested on demand. All they had to do was make an appointment to turn up at one of the testing centres and all would be well. Not even Jesus committed himself to that level of promise. He just stuck to loaves and fishes.The new key strategy was test, track and trace. Quite why it has taken the UK government so long to come round to the regime that has proved so effective for South Korea and Germany was left unsaid. The thought occurred that the health secretary may have been playing a long game here. By effectively admitting that the UK had been hopelessly behind the curve in its response to the coronavirus crisis – Brexit to celebrate, Boris’s domestic arrangements to be smoothed over – Matt was implicitly dobbing in all his cabinet colleagues. If he was going down, he was going to take as many as he could with him.There was a general air of disbelief about the chances of a proper “test, track and trace” strategy being implemented any time soon – we’ll believe it when we see it – so most questions focused on how any relaxation of lockdown regulations would take place. “I understand the thirst for knowledge,” Matt said. But it wasn’t a thirst he shared. Maybe he’s just too knackered to be that inquisitive right now. So he wasn’t going to bother to answer the question. Nor was he going to make the mistake of allowing any journalists to have a follow-up to ask why he hadn’t answered their original question. He couldn’t imagine which minister had been daft enough to introduce supplementaries in the first place. Just as well, because it had been him.The longer the briefing went on, the more visibly tired Hancock became. If any of his cabinet colleagues really gave a toss about his wellbeing they would tell him to take a week off. But they don’t. They need him to fail so they don’t have to. So Matt merely plodded on, repeating many of the old familiar lines we’ve heard at every press conference while trying to talk up “test, track and trace” from wish fulfilment to reality. It can’t be long before the health secretary starts talking about how we have the capacity to “test, track and trace” with the real problem being all those key workers failing to take advantage of the scheme.“We have always followed the science,” said Hancock, resorting to the one government mantra that really has been tested, tracked and traced. The two scientists, Sir Patrick Vallance and Prof John Newton, were both alive to the danger. They too have realised they are being lined up as potential scapegoats for the clusterfuck. “Actually, we just supply the evidence,” they corrected Hancock. “The decisions are taken by the government.” Things are going to get a lot uglier before life improves. And not just in Downing Street."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ac2b2c23433d28f023a1512d41fe668258491a1/0_150_12000_7200/master/12000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8086c6e62e69083cf3ddf3ab807ffa7","title":"therapy during coronavirus pandemic lockdown psychoanalysis freud","story":"In a pandemic, the best we can do to take care of one another is to stay away from one another. Even Freud at his most misanthropic could never have come up with that. By  Gary GreenbergFor the 35 years I have practised as a psychotherapist, I have discouraged people from seeing themselves as hapless victims of forces arrayed against them. That’s the whole premise – that whatever brought you to my office, it is hampering your ability to direct the course of your own life. So let’s name your pain and then do something about it. Tell off the boss, walk out on the husband, confront the perpetrator, whatever it takes, and then move on, become the agent of your existence.It’s a profession that has been good to me, and I hope good for my patients. But what if the premise is undone by circumstance? What if it turns out that we are hapless victims of a force arrayed against us, that will mercilessly hijack the machinery of our lives, that is silent and invisible and leaves us with nothing to do but cower in our homes and wash our hands and hope that it will pass us by? Is there a role for therapy in a pandemic?Those are not the kind of questions I used to start my work day with, unless my first patient was someone with paranoid delusions. But then again, until a month or so ago, I didn’t start my working day by sitting down in front of my computer and clicking a patient into view. I’m already getting accustomed to it the human capacity for adapting is remarkable. But the one thing I can’t get used to, so far anyway, is the way my patients’ faces appear in this simulacrum of intimacy. I may have sat for hours with them, watched their faces contort in anguish, or beam in satisfaction. I may have searched out their eyes, tried to bring them back into contact from their safe haven on the ceiling. I may have thought I knew every inch of these faces, and no longer even needed to ask what their expressions meant.I wasn’t wrong, not exactly. I just didn’t realise that all that searching was done against so many tempting distractions: the catalpa trees outside my window, the paintings on my wall, the little corner of ceiling tile that was chipped 30 years ago and has never been repaired. I could swivel in my chair, adjust my posture, look at the clock, and then back to the face. Now that it has been reduced to a flat image in the middle of a flat screen, and I have no easy elsewhere to look, I’m realising that half the work was the struggle to behold those faces, and half the satisfaction was succeeding in wrestling attention to the task at hand. And maybe half the treatment was their observing that struggle, feeling the love in it.Of course, there’s more to the video than just the face, and distractions aplenty on the screen. But they are unfamiliar to me, and not in the world I share with my patient. Take this patient, just a guy trying to figure out his life now that his wife has left him. I might have known all about his sex life and his financial woes, but not that his couch was brown and his living room painted sky blue. It feels a little indecent to be seeing it. It’s one thing to penetrate the hidden meaning of his words – after all, that’s what he’s paying me for – and quite another to catch a glimpse of something I’m only seeing because that’s where the best wifi is. Can I ask him what it means that the shelves above the couch are empty? Would that question be a sign of love, or just impertinence?But still, that face. It’s right there. I can’t escape it, as I imagine he can’t escape mine. I keep looking at the postage-stamp version of what he is seeing. It’s vanity that draws my attention back to that corner of my screen, but it’s also curiosity. This hard and wrinkled face, this half-smile, these hooded eyes: this is what my patient sees? So much of my job is making sure I understand what I am conveying, labouring to launch my words across the room with the right inflection, the right expression, the one that carries my concern as well as my scepticism, that challenges and supports in equal measure, and watching myself watching myself, I can see that I haven’t got the slightest idea of how I am coming across – and I am far too interested in finding out. I click off the view of my own face.So we are focused on each other’s faces, but there is still at least one thing missing: that moment when your mutual darting attention comes to rest and you make real eye contact, not the off-kilter kind that comes from peering at a screen located a few inches from a camera, but an actual meeting of actual eyes transmitted through the air of a shared room. You look into each other, and you see, even if you don’t say it out loud (and you rarely do) just how rare and precious this is, this intimacy that you have kindled by agreeing (and again mostly without saying so) to be honest with each other, and to sit with the consequences. Which is the whole point, the reason they pay and I work, and the means, if there is one, of healing, if there is any.God, I miss that.If anything unites the disparate branches of psychotherapy, it is the belief that trauma twists the timber of the self, and determines the precise shape of our suffering. Freud identified this as the “repetition compulsion”, the unconscious tendency to place ourselves in situations that are versions of the past – or to construe them that way. Some traumas are more obvious than others, outright violation easier to identify than the diffuse ineptitude of some parents, or their inability to provide both love and sustenance on a sales assistant’s salary, or the manifold humiliations children suffer at the hands of other children. But as capable as we might be at burying them, our traumas are more capable of haunting us. Therapy is the work of exhuming them, bringing them to light, and then putting them behind us.This idea that the pain of the past shapes our present experience has never been scientifically proven, but it is very likely that this idea is part of how you understand your own history, whether or not you ever enter into therapy. And if you do come into my office, we will ferret out the trauma at the source of your discontent, and, having found it, if our work is successful, you will recognise it as the moment that turned your life, and as the moment that you must leave behind.But what if the trauma is not hidden in the mists of time, but right here, in the midst of life? What if it grows at every moment, in every encounter, at no one’s hand in particular but at everyone’s hands – especially if they were unwashed and touched the apple that you are right now hesitating over in the supermarket. Maybe that guy on the other side of the apple bin is smiling at you, understanding exactly what you are thinking, or maybe he’s glaring at you, trying urgently to dissuade you from putting the apple back into the pile. You can’t tell, of course, because, like you, he is wearing a mask. And the only thing worse are the people who are not – the people who, encouraged by a president with a Jack-o’-lantern smile, believe that the cure is worse than the disease and have brought their entire families to the grocery store to escape their lockdown. Complain to me right now, in the middle of this video therapy session, about that president or the masks or the guy who touched the apple and put it back, and am I really going to tell you that your outrage is about your father – even if, in some ineluctable way, it is?Or maybe you work in a hospital emergency department and you come home from your shift every day and take your clothes off in the garage and shower in the basement before joining your family upstairs, and you’re trying to snuggle with your kids, but all you can think of is the intubation you did, in full hazmat kit, and all those virulent droplets the patient expelled as you slipped the tube down his throat? Or you work in a nursing home and your ex-wife won’t let you see your children, even at a distance, until this whole thing is over, which is when, exactly? Or you are stuck at home in a marriage that depended for its success, you are just finding out, on your not being stuck at home together. Shall we go down memory lane in search of the trauma that has you ricocheting between boredom and terror? Shall we dissect your emotions so that you can see just how neurotic your response is?Freud promised his patients nothing more than the ability to trade in neurotic misery for common unhappiness. Still, he harboured some optimism, albeit a strange variety. He would surely have scoffed at Anne Frank’s assertion that in spite of everything, people are still good at heart, but he did believe we have a heart, and that it could be convinced to ache less, if only we could tell it the right story. That story would have to be realistic. It could not be the “nursemaid’s lullaby” of religion or the paranoid person’s account of a world out to get him. Its hero would be the stoic, who could accept the price he paid for the comforts of civilisation: the never-ending need to restrain his animal nature, and to never lose sight of the inescapability of nature’s red tooth and claw. It was a tall order, but Freud was convinced that we could accommodate ourselves to reality rather than pretending reality was other than what it is.Freud placed his bet on the human, as the source of both suffering and balm. He didn’t reckon with a nemesis so indifferent as a virus, any more than he worried about a meteor crashing into the Earth or the sun suddenly being snuffed out. The nice thing about depravity is that we can imagine ways to suppress it, and even succeed, if fitfully, at doing so. It’s not clear yet if we are ingenious enough to do that with this virus, and even if we are, that outcome is a long way off. In the meantime, we are stuck with the imperative to restrain ourselves to a degree that Freud did not anticipate. At a time when we need each other badly, when we are under attack not by human nature but by nature itself, the best we can do to take care of one another is to stay away from one another. Even Freud at his most misanthropic never imagined that.Perhaps this is not the time to ask “What would Sigmund do?”. He’s not much of a role model in normal times, let alone times like these. It’s certainly not what I am asking right now, as I prepare for another day in front of the unblinking camera. What I am asking is the same thing that manufacturers turning their assembly lines to ventilator production or retailers improvising kerbside services are asking: how can I put my experience, my knowledge, my talents – suddenly rendered irrelevant and impotent – to use in a new and unfamiliar world?Some things are the same. People still complain about their wives and their kids and their bosses. They still have dreams, although it seems like a lot of them recently are about being trapped. They still well up with sadness or bite off their words in anger. They still look to me for support and guidance. They still laugh at my stupid jokes and tell me theirs. They still show up – although occasionally, if the appointment is in the evening, with a glass of wine. They still talk to me, answer my questions. They still pay me, if by online transfer.It’s reassuring, this continuity. It may help to explain one of the differences I’ve noticed: the ease with which people who are frequently evasive or argumentative or, as Freud would put it, resistant, seem to have suddenly shed their ambivalence. The man who could not talk about being molested now wants to, the woman whose abandonment by her husband left her too humiliated to speak of it now speaks of nothing else the couple who always showed up to the office five or 10 minutes late now sign into my virtual office five or 10 minutes early, and are perched eagerly on their sofa when I open my screen.Is it possible that the screen creates just enough distance to provide a safety that my words and gestures cannot? Have we inadvertently found a sweet spot between the detachment of everyday life and the cloud chamber of face-to-face therapy? Or are people so sick and tired of being cooped up with family, or alone, that they are spilling over with the desire to talk to someone else at any opportunity?I haven’t had time to interrogate this yet. I suppose if lockdown keeps up or gets more stringent, I will have to. Or maybe people will discover a new way to protect themselves from my intrusions, as the old forms of intimacy, the ones that require physical presence, recede into memory and the video version becomes the new normal. Perhaps Covid-19 has only accelerated a trend already under way.But the immediate question is not for the patients, but for me: what exactly am I supposed to do when I slip on the headphones and turn on the camera and another person in the midst of this crisis comes into view? The gambit of therapy is that the therapist is a few steps ahead of the patient, like a caving veteran leading a novice into a cavern unfamiliar to both he may not know the particulars, but his headlamp is a little brighter and he knows how to find his way around. But this cave is unfamiliar and my lamp is dim. I don’t even have a name yet for the strange admixture of emotion – fear and helplessness and disorientation and sadness and anger, in constantly shifting measure – that has taken hold in the last month or so, and that has become the new background of my life, too. I’m just as terrified as my patients are, maybe more so – and not just of drowning in Covid-19 or infecting my wife or losing my friends to disease. I’m as afraid of the aftermath as I am of the illness. Police are using helicopters to enforce social distancing. To those who defer to scientists and public health authorities, that may seem like a good idea. To those who crave power and who understand science well enough to know that this virus will be with us for a long time, it may seem like an opportunity.So I do not know what I am supposed to do when confronted with those worried, perplexed faces. I am making this up as I go along. I’m making more jokes than usual. I’m talking about my life more than I normally would, maybe because my patients hear my dogs barking or see the piano that sits in view of my camera as inexplicably as those empty shelves. And I am finding myself saying words I don’t remember saying, at least not so often: “Extraordinary times”, “unprecedented stress”, “uncharted waters”. To the man who can’t sleep, to the woman so racked by anxiety that she has begun to pull out her own hair, to the miserable college student whose postgraduate plans have evaporated along with the economy, to the parents of the high schooler who suddenly believes that the furniture in the house in which he is trapped is alive, and who, in less extraordinary times, probably would not have become psychotic, “I’m so sorry” is all I seem to have to offer.These are not the circumstances for which therapy is designed. The events that bring us into therapy generally have the decency to be limited in time and place. A global pandemic is global, and it may never fully recede, or it may be replaced by another, and either way, we will have learned what few people alive today know firsthand: that, despite our dams and cities, despite our weather forecasts, despite our medicines and ventilators, despite the vast knowledge and dedication of our scientists, the genius of our artists, and the scale of our achievements – despite everything we have built to keep ourselves safe, we are not. We can be undone – not only by one another, but by a strand of proteins, and not only in a moment, but with months of warning and over more months, perhaps years, of fear and illness. The horizons on which nuclear holocaust or global warming are gathering are just distant enough to remain abstract, and they are at least theoretically under human control. Not so with a virus.Therapists knew this long before Covid-19. Sit with people stunned by loss for any length of time and listen, really listen, to them, and it becomes clear that everyone will be confronted with grief and no one knows how it is supposed to go. So, if nothing else, we have got good at consolation. We know how to comfort, how to help people speak the unspeakable. Perhaps I will find use for other old tools, or the trauma of this pandemic will not prove as pervasive or persistent as it seems at this moment. But for the moment, this is what I have to offer those expectant, beautiful faces that are far away and so close: help in cataloguing the losses, and at grappling with them even as they mount. I can only hope it is sufficient.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df35d645a77e269babbd95c0d463daf02736a12e/0_213_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8398c89312707aecc240ad00b62de3bf","title":"european clubs collision course world rugby unacceptable fixture plans","story":"European rugby’s governing body has told World Rugby it intends to stage the Champions Cup final in October and says it is “unacceptable” to shoehorn extra autumn Tests into the calendar on weekends reserved for top-level club rugby when the sport resumes in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.There have been suggestions from within the Rugby Football Union and World Rugby that, in the likely event of this year’s July Tests not proceeding, extra internationals could be scheduled in October along with unplayed fixtures from the 2020 Six Nations championship. France’s Bernard Laporte, who is running for election as World Rugby’s vice-chairman, has also proposed a club World Cup which would effectively kill off Europe’s elite cross-border club competition, an idea later described as “a misunderstanding” by Bill Beaumont, World Rugby’s chairman.European Professional Club Rugby, however, has stressed it is looking at staging the closing stages of its tournaments in mid-October on the weekends allocated for the first two rounds of the 2020-21 campaign and is calling for proper consultation with its leading officials. “We absolutely do not accept a schedule of international rugby in October,” said Simon Halliday, EPCR’s chairman. “That directly clashes with us and we are informing World Rugby we fully intend to use our October window if we need it. We could play our semis and finals on those two weekends or, alternatively, just use one of them for the final and try and find two other dates in August and September for the quarters and semis.”Uncertainty clearly still surrounds the precise date when a resumption of rugby in Europe will be practicable but EPCR has strongly denied whispers from Ireland that the 2019‑20 season might be curtailed early. “When you have club tournaments locked into multi-year contracts with partners and broadcasters, which is the lifeblood of the game, you can’t just cancel everything. If we don’t do what we are contracted to do, there are serious ramifications,” said Halliday.“We can’t be bailed out by World Rugby, we don’t have that luxury. But we’re all connected, we’re all part of the same game. The value of our tournament, the Premiership, the Pro14 and the Top 14, collectively, is close to a billion pounds. Before people start saying what is valuable, it constitutes a very large – and increasing – percentage of the world’s rugby revenue. Significant investment has been made in European rugby.”The organisers have indicated they would, if necessary, be prepared to stage major knockout games, such as quarter-finals involving Exeter v Northampton and Leinster v Saracens, behind closed doors. In terms of qualification for next season, leeway may also be given to clubs, such as Toulouse, who sit just outside the European qualification places domestically with the Top 14 regular season having been halted. “If our finals do end up being played in October we would then look at the following season and operate a different format to allow for the exceptional difficulties encountered this season,” said Halliday.The former England centre is also adamant any new playing calendar must prioritise the players’ welfare, both on and off the field, and is urging all rugby’s stakeholders to come together at a time of significant global upheaval and human suffering. “We’re in times of real crisis here and we are not oblivious to worst-case scenarios. None of us entirely knows what will happen but everyone’s position in the game has to be respected. You’ve got to include the clubs and provinces of Europe at the heart of the conversation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6bc3423db990b4b28909725ae24e0307588188a/176_189_4654_2793/master/4654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fe2ce6c4ec2ada1101ee671b82b876a","title":"world test championship final hinges on england playing this summer","story":"The prospect of the inaugural World Test Championship (WTC) final taking place in 2021 will hinge on whether England can salvage a cricket season this year and get their home series against West Indies and Pakistan played.The International Cricket Council announced on Thursday that, following a conference call with its various national chief executives in response to the Covid-19 situation, decisions on whether to postpone the men’s T20 World Cup in October, the women’s World Cup in February and the WTC final next June have all been deferred.But while Australia and New Zealand, respective hosts of the first two tournaments, may wait as late as July to make final decisions, the fate of the WTC final could come sooner when the ECB establishes how much of its summer is damaged.The nine teams in the WTC need to have played six series apiece by the time the top two – currently India and Australia – play off for the trophy at Lord’s in June 2021 and, though a number are already starting to be postponed, the southern summer later in the year offers an outside chance of playing catch-up.Joe Root’s England side have played two series but are already in arrears after their tour of Sri Lanka was abandoned in March. Should they fail to host West Indies and Pakistan at home this year – both must be a minimum of two Tests – all three series would need to be played on the road next winter, on top of a five-Test visit to India from January.“The World Test Championship final next year lives and dies by whether England can host international cricket this summer,” one chief executive told the . “If England fall three series behind, it’s done.”The ICC conceded that the future tours programme will now need to be redrawn up to the year 2023 regardless while the chair of its medical committee, Dr Peter Harcourt, went on to stress the challenge in staging the two global tournaments.Harcourt said: “Our next step is to create a roadmap for the resumption of international cricket which will include a criteria for decision-making and a checklist for what needs to happen. This will consider everything from player preparation to government restrictions and advisories and ‘bio-bubbles’. The scale and complexity of getting cricket started again cannot be underestimated.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb4d47714d85fc22be2573315e595e9b09479fd8/0_67_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=768f1f90597941166b518574b44127d9","title":"maria bamford weakness is the brand review","story":"Available onlineTherapy, foreplay and the nature of standup all fall into the crosshairs of a scattergun show that never fails to find its targetWho better to turn to at a time of social isolation than an act whose best-known special was staged for an audience comprising just her mum and dad? That was an awkward watch – but happily, Maria Bamford widened access to her latest offering, Weakness is the Brand. She performed several of its routines on her London debut two years ago, before recording this LA performance last year. It showcases a more contented comedian whose volatile mental health (the subject of her Netflix series Lady Dynamite) is now lower in the mix. But weakness is still the brand, she boasts, showing off her trembling hand – and her comedy is as complicated, playful and emotionally exposing as ever.There’s no unifying theme, save Bamford’s journey towards self-acceptance as she navigates a world that mystifies her, but the routines are united by their complexity. Bamford never talks down to us or pretends things are simpler than they are: see the routine about her ethics, or her refusal to deliver an unpaid commencement speech at her alma mater, the University of Minnesota.But the jokes are creatively complex too. The one about role-playing “gentrification” and “the living wage” by way of marital foreplay the intense snorting reaction produced when her husband tells her she’s beautiful – these are jokes that wander far from their original premise in search of rich and inscrutable laughs.“The important thing about standup comedy,” she tells us with a wink, “is to call whatever you’re doing standup comedy.” But no one’s going to mistake Weakness is the Brand for anything else: Bamford is totally in command of the material, her audience and viewers at home.

Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings were targeted in particular.Zoom 5.0 will allow hosts to “report a user” to Zoom with a new security button and the app now defaults users to a “waiting room” feature, which requires participants to be approved to enter a meeting. All meetings will now require a password to enter.Zoom also added a new encryption standard, called AES 256-bit GCM encryption, which is considered the “gold standard” of encryption and is used by the US government to secure data.The change will help prevent meetings from being hijacked by hackers, said Thomas Hatch, the co-founder and chief technology officer of Utah-based software firm SaltStack.“The end-to-end encryption that has been introduced improves the liability that existed before where video conferences could be hijacked out of line,” he said. “This adds a much better layer of privacy that was not present before.”In addition to Zoom bombing concerns, the app had also received criticism over major bugs in recent months, including one that would allow a hacker to take full control over the user’s computer. To address these concerns, Zoom has beefed up its bug bounty program, incentivizing security professionals to alert them to bugs before hackers can exploit them.In a call on Wednesday, Yuan reiterated that Zoom will not sell user data. Zoom had been forced to clarify policies around data sale after a story from Motherboard at Vice revealed Zoom sends data from users of its iOS app to Facebook for advertising purposes, even if the user does not have a Facebook account.Zoom is not the only video conferencing platform, but it is easily one of the most popular. That is largely because of how easy it is to use, said Hank Schless, a senior manager at tech security firm Lookout.“The widespread use of conferencing solutions like Zoom shows how people are OK with putting convenience ahead of security,” he said. “Zoom got a lot of attention because users were not turning on many of its security settings. Despite that, they continue to log in every day because they assume the likelihood of being a victim is too low to affect them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c132b27554fd934f797cdd79172e9b3bbabe6e6/0_0_960_576/master/960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c420d2f33f8fc09cda63c33df98835ae","title":"the book novel that inspired me to travel readers tips","story":"Words on a page can bring the world to life. Readers select the travel books and novels that made them go out and discover it by sparking their imaginationsI read Jupiter’s Travels while living in Cambodia. Ted Simon’s tales of his motorcycle adventure around the world is so thrilling and adventurous that I immediately went out and bought an old Honda. I dreamed of following in his tyre tracks and travelling around the world, being welcomed as a hero everywhere I’d go. I didn’t get very far – the Vietnamese authorities wouldn’t allow the bike over the border – but a motorcycle world tour is still the top of my bucket list, and Jupiter’s Travels taught me to embrace the journey, not just the destination.Chris PicklesIt’s not strictly a travel book, but the novel that inspired me to pursue my dream of traveling in China was Soul Mountain. It is loosely based on Gao Xingjian’s own experience of escaping mainland China after being labelled a counter-revolutionary during the Cultural Revolution. The writing style has a dream-like spiritual quality that carries you effortlessly along the journey. It is split into two voices – You and I – which makes it unique among any book I’ve ever read as it directly addresses the reader. Madison PlantierMayle makes Provence – though seen through a fantasy gauze – seem hypnotic, and the food, drink and lifestyle of the local country folk are charming beyond compare. He describes the region one month at a time (hence A Year in Provence) and you live his dealings with local tradepeople, the postman and neighbours. The walks through markets leave you drooling for some chèvre and a crust of bread. The restaurants and stories about the clientele are delightful. In his second book, Toujours Provence, he said people were contacting him from all over the world – a woman in Indiana asked “How are the schools?” The fantasy of living there has driven many of us to visit.Kirby LindsayHemingway’s autobiographical book about living in a cold flat on the Left Bank of Paris with his wife and child in the 1920s, while making the transition from journalist to novelist, made the biggest travel impact on me. It took me 15 years to make it to Paris after reading the book, but I retraced the paths he walked –down the side streets that laced together his hangouts, from the Shakespeare \u0026amp Company bookshop next to the River Seine, to walking to his mentor Gertrude Stein’s residence at 27 rue de Fleurus, while avoiding the smells that might trigger his hunger when he was low on money. The book still works as tour guide, as much of that version of Paris still exists.Mike HainsworthPamuk’s novel is about a lovelorn fellow who collects (and sometimes steals) hundreds of little mementos of his girlfriend. Along the way we are treated to wonderful insights into life in Istanbul in the 1970s. And there is a real museum to match! Hidden in a little alley near the port is a tall, narrow building displaying all the book’s mementos. Even if you haven’t read the book, it’s fascinating. If you have, it’s like stepping into the story. Caroline MorganI read For a Pagan Song and fell in love again. In this sad, beautiful story of self-recovery, the writer found his piece of paradise with the Kalash people in the Hindu Kush in north-west Pakistan, having followed in the footsteps of Peachey and Daniel from Rudyard Kipling’s The Man Who Would be King. The Kalash are the last people in the Hindu Kush who continue to practise their ancient pagan religion in the valleys of Bumburet, Birir and Rumbur. They look almost European, possibly descended from Alexander the Great. I wanted to meet them. Having travelled through beautiful Pakistan in 1995 I returned in 2015 and, travelling through some adventurous terrain and situations, also found that piece of paradise. Thank you, Jonny.Helen RitchieI first read Along the Inca Road back in 2000 when I was 14. It told me about a world I had never previously imagined and awakened a lifelong love of travelling and fascination with Latin America. In the intervening years I have been fortunate enough to travel to South America several times and see the incredible landscapes and places described in the book, inspiring the same sense of awe I felt as a 14-year-old in suburban England, dreaming of what lay beyond. I reread the book every few years, and it is currently helping to satisfy my wanderlust during the lockdown.NatalieThe novel that inspired me to go to India was Shantaram. Gregory David Roberts imbues the narrative with a real sense of place. It is a novel about Bombay (now Mumbai) as much as it is about the storyline and colourful characters he creates. Lin, the narrator, arrives in Bombay on the run using a false passport and makes friends with Prabaker, a local. Together they enter the hidden world of the city’s slums and mingle with down-and-outs and reprobates. Lin and his friends meet at the Leopold Cafe – and I just had to visit the cafe when I eventually got to Mumbai! This is a perfect book for armchair travel and certainly inspired me to visit the city.Tina HartasI was 12 when I started reading this novel, the story of a medieval doctor and philosopher in plague-ridden Bruges. The description of churches, old buildings and yards lead to mysterious and beautiful canals made me want to know everything about the city. Being from far away Brazil, it struck me as somewhere almost heavenly, and I fed on this dream until I was able to travel to Europe for the first time. And Bruges is still the most beautiful city in the world for me, a journey back in time, and this book still my favourite story.Maria Rosa Nascimento SilvaIn 1986 I was in traction for six weeks with a broken pelvis. A friend lent me Hawkfall, a book of local fables by the Orcadian writer George Mackay Brown, and I was captivated. My ensuing trip involved the Far North Line rural railway to Thurso and then a ferry across to Orkney narrow streets of Stromness, Skara Brae, Maeshowe and Brough of Birsay the Earl’s Palace in Kirkwall bonxies (great skuas), short-eared owls and red-throated ers and the sing-song accent of the locals, who were so welcoming. It was even better than I’d hoped for. Thirty years on and with early retirement on the horizon, a return trip is being planned and Hawkfall reread.DonI read The Peacock Spring when I was 14. I was completely captivated by the story of an English teenage girl in colonial India who fell in love with the gardening boy. The yearning for India never left me. I reread the book in 2016 at the age of 53, and then finally travelled to south India. It was every bit as magical as I had imagined.Sarah WheelerLee’s traverse of Spain in the shadow of the civil war remains the ultimate paean to travel itself, and the best portrait of this most varied and misunderstood country. At once sparse (“I had a few shillings in my pocket and no return ticket”) and poetic (“the city moved somnambulantly before me like a series of engravings seen through watery glass”), the prose contrasts the simplicity of the quest with the richness of the experience. This heady promise of exploration and delight prompted my own trip, as I too threw off the shackles of my West Country youth. It finished in Andalucía and, like Lee, l knew I would return.Andy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0a0eb216029fcc4d93d8b209444ad9f9f2783e0/59_0_5580_3351/master/5580.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63e8579d7ca80dbeacaba59f016cf965","title":"the best places to rock climb in the world in pictures","story":"We can only dream of travel and adventure right now, but a new book about the best climbs across the world might provide inspiration.

Hoarding bottled water simply isn’t necessary for most people.What’s more, most bottled water sold in the US comes from the same municipal sources that supply tap water – a fact probably unknown to most consumers. Coca-Cola makes Dasani at the company’s Detroit plant by purchasing, treating and bottling municipal water before selling it at a significant mark-up to consumers. Pepsi bottles its Aquafina water brand in Detroit the same way.The business model is hugely profitable. The cost to buy that municipal water is exceedingly low – and once bottled, the mark-up can be about 133 times greater, a Consumer Reports analysis of company water billing and usage records found.But what’s good for businesses isn’t necessarily good for consumers, according to CR’s review, which included the examination of hundreds of pages of billing and other records obtained through public records requests, and interviews with environmental law experts, industry consultants, residents of Detroit and consumer advocates.For starters, bottlers and consumers aren’t always treated as equals by water utilities, CR found. In Detroit, whose policy before the coronavirus crisis called for shutting off water to residents if they fall $150 behind in their water bills, 2,800 homes were estimated to be without running water at the start of the pandemic.But bottlers in Detroit have also racked up tens of thousands of dollars of past due water bills that went unpaid for months, CR found. Not once has their access to water been shut off over the period we examined. When asked why, the city cited the companies’ strong payment history and an ability to pay their bills.From a regulatory point of view, companies that want to put vast quantities of public water into bottles for profit face few hurdles and minimal ancillary costs, leading some experts to call for taxes on the bottlers. And because the water supply, including the processing and infrastructure, that bottlers rely on is paid for by local taxpayers, the companies’ business is subsidized by the public, consumer advocates say.Detroit has been questioned about the potential health risk of water shutoffs before. In August 2014, residents who had their taps turned off argued in court to suspend shutoffs because a lack of water could create unsanitary conditions and lead to the transmission of hepatitis A, influenza and other diseases.Detroit’s lawyers argued that those residents could rely on alternative sources – like bottled water. “Just because a person is out of water doesn’t mean they can’t get water,” a city lawyer said at a court hearing.The judge in the case ultimately sided with the city, and the shutoff campaign carried on.Now, six years later, Detroit and other cities have taken some steps to address residential water shutoffs during the coronavirus crisis – people need running water not just to cook and bathe, but to practice basic virus-fighting hygiene.But the reprieve is only temporary. And it hasn’t necessarily reached everyone.A Detroit spokesperson said all customers who called to enroll in a program that would turn their water back on during the pandemic had either been restored or were in the process of a restoration. But the spokesperson conceded that some occupants may not have called, and advocates dispute the city’s reported progress.“We believe the city of Detroit is vastly exaggerating their progress and underreporting the number of people without water,” said Shea Howell, a member of the Detroit-based advocacy group the People’s Water Board Coalition, during a recent teleconference with reporters.“It’s just unconscionable to make people fear losing their water service at this time,” said Mary Grant, director of the Public Water for All Campaign at Food \u0026amp Water Watch. “We need every governor to step up to address this crisis immediately.”People whose water gets shut off because they can’t afford their bill may have no choice but to buy bottled water that comes from the same source that feeds their tap. They may be obtaining bottled water from companies that have been behind on their water bills but didn’t face a shutoff, and whose business depends on access to publicly funded water systems.And it’s not just in Detroit: Coca-Cola and Pepsi get water from other major cities, including Phoenix and Denver, with a history of shutting off water to residents before the coronavirus crisis.Coca-Cola didn’t respond to questions from CR about water shutoffs or its late payments, but the company says it obtains water from a variety of sources, including municipal supplies, and uses a treatment process that “creates a consistent pure, clean, and crisp taste”. The company said it remains in operation as the federal government identified the food and beverage industry as “critical” to keeping grocery stores stocked.Two decades ago, most bottled water in the US came from natural springs, sold by brands like Evian and Nestlé’s Poland Spring.Pepsi did not respond to repeated requests for comment from CR.Beulah Walker, chief coordinator for the local not-for-profit group Hydrate Detroit, which assists local residents without running water, pointed out the irony of the situation for residents who have lost their water service at home and may turn to bottled water – possibly Aquafina or Dasani made with city tap water – as an alternative.“Detroit residents are paying twice when they buy bottled water,” Walker says.In 2014, Detroit’s shutoff policy drew national attention, when the city, which emerged that year from bankruptcy, launched a campaign to disconnect service to residents in arrears – forcing them to turn to other sources such as capturing rainwater or buying bottled water. Shutoffs have continued since then, but officials concluded in early March that a reprieve was needed to help residents during the coronavirus outbreak.Ricky Reynolds is one of the beneficiaries. The 65-year-old Detroit resident moved into his home down the road from Coca-Cola’s bottling plant last summer, after obtaining the deed from an acquaintance for $500. It should have been a happy occasion. Reynolds had been homeless, bouncing between family and friends, so it was a relief to get his own place – until he tried to get the water bill put in his name.Reynolds, who is retired, learned from the city that his new home had a nearly $20,000 unpaid water bill.In the months before the city finally restored his water service during the pandemic, Reynolds says, he had to fill up containers with water from family members, then haul them home. And he bought bottled water whenever he could – including, he said, Dasani, which may have been made around the corner at the Coca-Cola plant. (The city didn’t directly respond to questions about Reynolds’ case.)Detroit’s temporarily suspended shutoff policy states that residents or businesses are delinquent and potentially risk having their water shut off if they are 60 days past due with a minimum balance of $150, a spokesperson said. (The city considers a company’s accounting practices, as well, before determining whether to proceed with a service interruption.)Records show that, since 2017, both Pepsi and Coca-Cola met that threshold at points.Between April and July 2017, billing records show, Coca-Cola had a $77,600 balance that went unpaid for three months. From August to November of that year, it carried a balance of as much as $287,250, before finally paying it off. That December to March of 2018, the company had a balance that fluctuated between $1,860 to $108,170, before paying it off in full. Meanwhile, from December 2018 to February 2019, Pepsi had a balance between $1,410 and $29,710, until paying it off.The city never shut off the company’s water, and bottling continued.“Since both Pepsi and Coca-Cola have a strong payment history and an unmatched ability to pay their bills, DWSD does not pursue service interruptions,” said Bryan Peckinpaugh, spokesman for Detroit’s water and sewage department.“These companies never go longer than three months past due, at which time the balances due, including late fees, are paid. These companies are not a priority target for service interruption due to their payment history and ability to pay.”Coca-Cola and Pepsi did not respond to CR’s questions about why they went months without paying their bills.Grant, of Food \u0026amp Water Watch, takes exception to the city’s position. “You should have a policy and should apply it equitably,” she said. “I think this is discrimination against low-income households in Detroit, that you’re having a shutoff policy and you’re not applying it, the same shutoff policy, to these big corporations because you expect them to pay down the road.”Reynolds was also stunned to hear that Detroit let Coke and Pepsi’s bills slide.“That’s not fair,” he said. “They’re picking on the little guy.”This story is co-published in partnership with Consumer Reports, which has a full version of the story here.

The tests will also be offered to the families of key workers, and it is expected that the devolved administrations will follow suit.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: “We can make it easier, faster and simpler for any essential worker in England who needs a test to get a test.“Any essential workers who need a test will be able to book an appointment on gov.uk themselves directly. This applies for people in essential workers’ households too, who need a test. It’s all part of getting Britain back on her feet.”The main focus for tests, available from Friday, will be the antigen variety, which tells people whether they currently have the illness. Antigen swab testing can show medics what treatment a patient should receive and who should isolate and who is able to return to work.An antibody blood test showing whether someone has had the illness in the past, which some have argued is more useful, will be used by the government in its forthcoming survey of the disease.The government has so far been under fire for setting an ambitious target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month, while drive-through testing facilities have been shown to be underused and difficult for care workers to access if they do not own a car.Capacity currently stands at 51,000 tests a day. In the last 24 hours, 23,560 tests were carried out on 14,629 people.Professor John Newton, director of health improvement at Public Health England, who is coordinating testing, told the press conference that the government was on track to meet its 100,000 target.Contact tracing will be rolled out on a “large scale” with a new NHS app, Hancock said. If you are unwell, you can inform the app, which can let other people with it downloaded know that they have recently been in contact with someone with suspected coronavirus.To “kickstart” tracing, the government will hire 18,000 people, including 3,000 clinicians and public health experts, who will be trained over the coming weeks.The range of jobs classed as essential is extensive, and includes teachers and support staff, people in the justice system, charities, workers delivering key frontline services, transport workers and those working for local government.The process is free and results will be sent out by text, with a helpdesk set up to deal with queries.The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said Labour had consistently asked for a testing and tracing strategy. He said: “It is crucial that greater numbers of critical workers such as care staff are now able to access testing.“We will continue to hold the government to account for the promise it has made of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month.”Teaching unions and school leaders have welcomed the announcement that school staff will be able to access coronavirus testing, with some calling it an essential precondition before schools are reopened.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: “School staff have been on the frontline in the national response to coronavirus. We have been clear from the start that governments across the UK understand they must honour this effort with the appropriate level of support and safety.“If testing can be delivered effectively, then it will be welcomed by the education sector.”Kevin Courtney of the National Education Union said the immediate priority was for teachers who were self-isolating to get tested, and that so far the government had been slow to respond.The number of drive-through test centres will increase from 30 to 48 and the army will run 48 mobile testing units, which will be used to target care homes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01cbc71b699baa176fd7a8e64e4ad8167bd32328/98_31_1162_698/master/1162.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2cd7e56c472f87d94cbad8e69e7ae214","title":"expert advice on the wearing of face masks","story":"Dr Giuseppe Bignardi, Alan Wild and John Kirwood on the debate over whether the general public should wear masks to stop the spread of Covid-19The claim by ministers that recommending the use of masks in the community could jeopardise the NHS supply (Scientists join calls for UK public to wear homemade face masks outdoors, 21 April) is disingenuous. The face masks recommended for use in the community by various bodies are homemade cloth masks or reusable washable masks of the type used by cyclists. A recommendation for that type of mask is not likely to impact on the supply of the rather different single-use medical masks.An article in the Lancet on 16 April endorses the use of masks in the community as a low-cost adjunct to social distancing and hand hygiene.While other nations have outlined their lockdown exit plans, which in the case of Italy includes the use of face masks, our government is reluctant to explain how it intends to contain Covid-19 when it starts lifting restrictions. The experience in many Asian countries is that shifting the effort to the community, with testing of all cases, contact-tracing and encouraging the use of masks, could prevent a second peak.Dr Giuseppe BignardiDurham• At least one of your readers has joined the bandwagon on wearing face masks during the present coronavirus crisis (Letters, 20 April). The current government advice from the top medical experts and scientists is that the wearing of face masks in the street has little effect on the spread of the virus. The chronic shortage of personal protective equipment means that specialist masks are vital for doctors, nurses and carers. To see people wearing them in the street is, frankly, annoying when this equipment is so essential elsewhere, in hospitals and care homes. And are homemade masks all that effective?The jury may be out, but to insist everyone wears a mask at present almost suggests we are living in a totalitarian society where the air is badly polluted. Let’s at least wait for the experts to direct us.Alan WildRochdale, Greater Manchester• Anyone doubting the benefit of wearing a simple face mask should try reading the  Daily on an iPad for a few days with a mask, and then without one.

The claim alleged that China arrested whistleblowers and concealed the contagious nature of coronavirus, leading to economic harm and loss of life in the US state.“The impact of the virus is very real,” said Eric Schmitt, the state’s attorney general. “Thousands have been infected and many have died, families have been separated from dying loved ones, small businesses are shuttering their doors, and those living paycheck to paycheck are struggling to put food on their table. The Chinese government … must be held accountable for their actions.”Class actions have already been filed in other US courts by private groups pursuing damages, with the aim of recovering trillions of dollars in compensation from China.“These lawsuits face significant legal challenges,” warned the London-based international law firm Volterra Fietta. “The US Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 strictly limits the possibility of suing foreign states and their agencies before US courts.“The principle of foreign state immunity is widely recognised in international law – the vast majority of states have enacted legislation that provides for sovereign immunity.”In Italy, a ski resort hotel in the Dolomites presented a subpoena to a local court seeking compensation from China’s health ministry for its loss of business. The hotel was fully booked for the season, including the period of 18-22 March, when the Alpine Ski World Cup had been due to take place.“The early and sudden closure led to disastrous consequences, including the dismissal of all staff and the cancellation of contracts with suppliers,” Marco Vignola, the lawyer representing the hotel, told Italian media.ONEurope Onlus, which organises projects to help immigrants integrate in Italy, has backed the action. Codacons, the Italian consumers’ association, is evaluating possible class action against the Chinese government through US courts.“Blaming China for our current predicament, now using legal means, is a reticence to take a harder road: local leaders accepting political responsibility for decades of undermining public health systems, while building a more socially inclusive and resilient global order.”The Chinese ambassador to the UK on Thursday dismissed the legal claims as reminiscent of 19th-century European colonial wars. “This disinformation about China covering up, about China hiding something – this is not true,” Liu Xiaoming said.“The Chinese government was transparent and very quick to share data. Some other countries, their local courts sued China – it is absurd,” he said. “Some politicians, some people, want to play at being the world’s policeman – this is not the era of gunboat diplomacy, this is not the era when China was a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society.”China is not the only target. The blizzard of legal activity includes claims by hundreds of tourists against local authorities in the Austrian ski resort of Ischgl, accusing the authorities of exposing the tourists to the virus. Austria’s consumer protection association alleges that the resort was kept open despite the risk to skiers.Günther Platter, the governnor of Tyrol state, has said all decisions were taken “together with experts on the basis of the existing knowledge”.In other contexts, commentators have devised the term “lawfare” to denigrate claims deemed to be misusing legal principles to pursue political aims through courts. Such accusations may surface in the months to come.While many lawyers around the world are enduring enforced idleness due to Covid-19 restrictions, they could soon be busy. Those sued may well invoke the legal principle of force majeure – that extraordinary events alter parties’ obligations.Apprehension over the scale of claims about to hit courts has already prompted the Medical Defence Union, which represents many UK doctors, to suggest that legal immunity might be granted to medics risking their lives during the pandemic.Several US states, including New York, New Jersey and Michigan, have adopted laws that provide healthcare professionals and hospitals with “immunity from civil liability for any injury or death alleged to have been sustained because of any acts or omissions undertaken in good faith” during the crisis.

But suggestions of a greater US presence in Greenland were met with criticism in Greenland and Denmark on Thursday.Aaja Chemnitz Larsen from the left-leaning opposition party Inuit Ataqatigiit described it as a charm offensive.“The Americans are welcome if they want to invest in Greenland,” she said. “But it is important to make sure that Greenland doesn’t owe anything back to the United States. We are sceptical about what they really want besides influence.”She added that it must clear what the money should be spent on.Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen, an associate professor with the Royal Danish Defence College in Copenhagen, said the US had been missing out in terms of its Arctic strategy, giving Russia and China a head start in the region, and was now coming back with a large sum of money. They are trying to get back to having a presence in the Arctic and are doing it “with a big fanfare”, he said.An opinion piece written earlier this week by the American ambassador to Denmark, Carla Sands, previewed the announcement and said the US would be the preferred partner in the Arctic, a comment that sparked harsh reactions in Denmark.“They have clearly crossed the line,” said Carsten Hønge, an outspoken member of the left-leaning Socialist People’s party that supports the Social Democrat-led minority government. “We must draw a line in the ice cap.”Søren Espersen of the opposition Danish People’s party told the Danish broadcaster DR that financial aid was something you say about developing countries. “But Greenland is not a developing country. It is a western democracy. I think its reprehensible.”Greenland covers 2.166m sq km (836,000 sq miles) but has a population of only 56,000, mainly Inuits.Greenland harbours some of the largest deposits of rare-earth metals, including neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium and terbium, along with uranium and the byproducts of zinc.US corporations once thought of China as a benign supplier of rare-earth metals for mobile phones, computers and more recently electric cars. And the US government was relaxed when Chinese companies began hoovering up mines across\u0026nbspcentral and southern Africa\u0026nbspto secure an even greater dominance of the global market.But the arrival of\u0026nbspXi Jinping\u0026nbspas China’s leader, and his more aggressive foreign policy stance, has spooked many US policymakers.

The Inuit premier, Kim Kielsen, said at the time the island was not for sale, while the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said: “Greenland is not Danish. Greenland is Greenlandic. I persistently hope that this is not something that is seriously meant.”Even there, conditions are far from ideal, due to the long winter with frozen ports, 24-hour darkness and temperatures regularly dropping below -30C (-22F) in northern parts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d06619cc956babf6fa85e7f2c873ff62e39d9254/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a08f58ce6a5779a5297004a114c9833e","title":"lockdown may be lifted earlier in northern ireland than rest of uk","story":"Arlene Foster makes statement as it emerges extra critical care capacity not expected to be neededCoronavirus lockdown restrictions may be lifted earlier in Northern Ireland than in the rest of the UK, the first minister, Arlene Foster, has said, as it emerged that extra critical care capacity is not expected to be needed during the first wave of the pandemic.The death rate in Northern Ireland is half that of England, and the projected death toll from coronavirus in Northern Ireland was revised down this week to 1,500. Earlier modelling had suggested a worst-case scenario of 15,000 deaths.The health minster, Robin Swann, said on Thursday: “For the time being our latest data modelling indicates that further critical care capacity will not be required during the first wave of transmission in Northern Ireland.”A virologist at Queen’s University Belfast has put the lower than expected death toll down to Northern Ireland’s low population density compared with other parts of the UK.There have been 263 deaths in Northern Ireland to date, a rate of 14 deaths per 100,000 population, compared with England’s 30 deaths per 100,000, based on the latest daily figures on hospital deaths published by NHS England.The three smaller UK nations all recorded their first deaths later than England, which may mean the disease began circulating later, while less urbanisation in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland could also be a contributory factor.But Swann warned against complacency in any moves to ease the clampdown on social, business, travel and other activities over the next few weeks.Foster said lockdown measures would be eased when scientific and public health criteria were met and she would give no timetables or dates.Foster told Cool FM radio on Thursday that any lifting of the lockdown would have to be “set down and agreed” with both the power-sharing Northern Ireland executive and the government in London.“And because of that, you could well see different parts of the United Kingdom move in different time to other parts, because it will be criteria-led,” she said. “What do I mean by that? We will have to look at the amount of admissions to hospital, the admissions to intensive care units, the number of deaths we have, what it means for us in terms of the science.”Northern Ireland’s chief medical officer, Dr Michael McBride, said local health officials had recorded a flattening of the Covid-19 infection curve in the region.Dr Lindsay Broadbent, a virologist and research fellow at the WellcomeWolfson Institute for Experimental Medicine at Queen’s University of Belfast, said there were some grounds for optimism that aspects of the local lockdown could be lifted.“There may be regional differences to ending the lockdown across the UK and Ireland. This will have to be guided by the science,” she told the .Broadbent said Northern Ireland’s lower projected death toll from the coronavirus was “due to population density and hospital and ICU capacity, for example”. Another factor was that “stricter measures may have been in place longer than somewhere like London.” All of Northern Ireland has been in lockdown since 17 March.Swann, appeared more sceptical about lifting restrictions compared with the first minister. He said it was too early for his department to confirm that the number of Covid-19 deaths had peaked in the region.“While there are grounds for hope that the outbreak can be brought under control, the outbreak has not reached a point where some of the measures can be relaxed,” he said.One of the most controversial measures of Northern Ireland’s lockdown has been the closure of all cemeteries. Members of the public unable to visit loved ones’ graves have complained that while cemetery gates are locked, large queues snake outside off-licences, which remain open.The Northern Ireland executive remains split over cemetery closures, with Sinn Féin in favour of keeping them closed while the Ulster Unionists have argued they could be reopened with strict distancing measures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27c0e97028a48c1df6675eb1e95caabe2eb713b1/79_275_3013_1808/master/3013.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e73862ad295867ce7c746b9d164d87d","title":"scientists criticise uk government over following the science","story":"Ministers accused of abdicating political duty to narrow field of opaque expertise on Covid-19Experts have voiced growing frustration over the UK government’s claim that it is “following the science”, saying the refrain is being used to abdicate responsibility for political decisions.They also raised concerns that the views of public health experts were being overlooked, with disproportionate weight given to the views of modellers.“As a scientist, I hope I never again hear the phrase ‘based on the best science and evidence’ spoken by a politician,” Prof Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, told the . “This phrase has become basically meaningless and used to explain anything and everything.”The government has repeatedly said it is being “led by the science” on decisions ranging from banning mass gatherings to closing schools, the use of face masks and, most recently, the prospects of lifting the lockdown.However, Sridhar and others argued that scientific views on these topics could be wide-ranging and dependent on a scientist’s field of expertise.The ersity of scientific views was apparent in March when case numbers were rising rapidly but the government chose not to ban mass gatherings or introduce wide-reaching physical distancing.“World Health Organization advice, and what we’ve learned from lots of previous outbreaks in low- and middle-income countries, is that the faster you move at the start, the better, because it’s exponential growth,” Sridhar said. “In public health, a test, trace and isolate campaign would’ve been where your mind first went.”Instead, she said, the government appeared to be basing policy on the presumption of a binary choice between two scenarios, played out in computer models, of either eradicating the virus or it becoming endemic.Prof Mark Woolhouse, an infectious diseases epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh, said modelling had had a disproportionate influence. “I do think scientific advice is driven far too much by epidemiology – and I’m an epidemiologist.“What we’re not talking about in the same formal, quantitative way are the economic costs, the social costs, the psychological costs of being under lockdown,” he said. “I understand that the government is being advised by economists, psychiatrists and others, but we’re not seeing what that science is telling them. I find that very puzzling.”Woolhouse said that while it was understandable that saving lives was the top priority, the idea of doing this at any cost was naive.“With any disease there is a trade-off. Public health is largely about that trade-off. What’s happening here is that both sides of the equation are so enormous and so damaging that the routine public health challenge of balancing costs and benefits is thrown into incredibly stark relief. Yet that balance has to be found.”Sridhar said the failure to fully consider the perspectives of experts beyond epidemiology may have contributed to misguided decisions. Models appear not to have factored in the role of hospital staff shortages, which may have erted attention from the urgent need for adequate personal protective equipment, she said.The concept of shielding the most vulnerable “looks beautiful” in models, she said, but in reality care homes are facing major outbreaks and multigenerational households are struggling to isolate the vulnerable. “You can’t take these people out of the system and isolate them as if they were a data point on a graph,” she said.“There’s a real problem if you have a collection of people from the same background, the same field, the same institutions that can lead to blindspots and groupthink,” Sridhar added. “Diversity is clearly important for better decision-making.”Some fear the prominence given to science in supporting political decisions risks burdening scientists with unrealistic expectations and could ultimately erode trust in their expertise.“The government isn’t using expertise simply to validate claims, it also appears to be using it as an insurance policy,” Prof Christina Boswell, a political scientist at the University of Edinburgh, wrote this week. “If things go wrong – and the curve gets too steep – it will be the scientific advice that is to blame.”Prof Chris Whitty: the truthtellerChief medical officers have a tradition of speaking their mind, often to the chagrin of governments. Whitty, however, has appeared to be in perfect harmony with the UK government at the Downing Street briefings on Covid-19. The reality is probably that ministers are in step with him – or even a step behind. On Wednesday, Whitty, a practising NHS consultant physician, told a starker truth than politicians have dared: that physial distancing needs to be in place until at least the end of the year.Sir Patrick Vallance: the political naifVallance has had a career in medicine at University College London and St George’s, University of London, researching vascular biology and endothelial cell physiology, and also in the pharmaceutical industry. From 2012 to 2018, he was president of research and development at GlaxoSmithKline, where, unusually for the industry, he advocated greater openness about innovation and partnerships with other companies.He left to become the government’s chief scientific adviser, but is not an instinctive politician. He was partly blamed for the government’s flirtation with the notion of herd immunity, saying in March that the strategy was to reduce the peak, not suppress it completely. “Also, because the vast majority of people get a mild illness, to build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease.” Afterwards it was denied he meant herd immunity should be the goal it was simply an outcome.Neil Ferguson: the workaholicFerguson leads the modelling behind the UK response through the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, which he founded with colleagues at Imperial College. He has a long history in modelling epidemics, originally with Roy Anderson’s unit at Oxford University, where they worked on BSE, vCJD, foot and mouth, Sars and swine flu – sometimes attracting controversy.Ferguson is a mathematician, an epidemiologist and a workaholic who, before the lockdown, moved seamlessly between Downing Street, university and press briefings. Even while recovering from Covid-19 himself, he gave evidence to MPs and did interviews. His team’s work is at the heart of the lockdown strategy, predicting the numbers of deaths it will save.Dr Jenny Harries: the ‘national treasure’The deputy chief medical officer has been called a “national treasure” by Vogue, which may reflect the fact she is a rarity – a woman on the Downing Street briefings podium. With degrees in pharmacology and medicine, she joined Public Health England in 2013. Like her boss, Whitty, she is independent-minded, and she warned at the end of March that the lockdown could last for six months or longer. She also suggested couples living separately could “test the strength of their relationship” during the lockdown by moving in together.Prof Jonathan Van-Tam: the flu expertJonathan Stafford Nguyen Van-Tam is a widely published expert on influenza and the vaccines and antiviral drugs used to treat it. Now one of the government’s two deputy chief medical officers, he is regularly deferred to by Hancock. He spent four years in the pharmaceutical industry before returning to the public sector to head the pandemic influenza office of the Health Protection Agency, which is now part of Pubic Health England, and was a member of Sage during the 2009-10 swine flu pandemic. His grandfather Nguyễn văn Tâm was the prime minister of Vietnam in 1952.Prof Stephen Powis: the NHS’s defenderA kidney specialist, Powis is a professor of renal medicine at UCL and was the medical director of the Royal Free hospital until 2018. Now the medical director of NHS England, his job is to defend it against the threat of Covid-19. As such, his comments at Downing Street briefings have not always stuck to the medical need. With Michael Gove on 4 April, he criticised people sabotaging 5G phone masts under the illusion they were implicated in the spread of the virus. “I’m absolutely outraged, absolutely disgusted, that people would be taking action against the very infrastructure that we need to respond to this health emergency,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe7ff26500a707bd817940dfab8604498055383a/60_129_2056_1234/master/2056.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f11a181ba368381b45ad77c6eaf6a760","title":"test trace contain how south korea flattened its coronavirus curve","story":"As life begins to return to something like normality in Seoul and beyond, other countries are asking what lessons can be learnedLate last week millions of South Koreans queued patiently at polling stations to cast their votes for a new national assembly. If any uttered words of frustration from behind their masks, they were out of earshot of their fellow voters, kept at a distance by duct tape marking appropriate intervals.As they waited to wash their hands and pull on disposable plastic gloves before entering the booths, some may have allowed themselves to contemplate life beyond exercising their democratic right: an imminent return to work, a round of golf or, at last, a chance to shop for something more indulgent than food and hand sanitiser.Going out for dinner, let alone voting in a national election, would have seemed almost inconceivable weeks earlier when the coronavirus threatened to exact the same relentless toll on South Koreans as it has in the US and parts of Europe.Long before politicians in Britain accepted that the illness posed a serious threat to public health, South Korea watched the rise in reported daily infections with growing alarm. After the country reported its first case on 20 January, numbers initially remained low before climbing sharply, reaching a peak of 909 daily infections on 29 February.Then something extraordinary happened. The steep rise in cases began to plateau. By late March, daily infections were being counted in the dozens, and then in single digits. In the space of a few weeks, South Korea had flattened the curve.Other countries are now looking to South Korea and its three guiding principles on how to reign in the outbreak: test, trace and contain.Perhaps most striking is South Korea’s ability to tame the coronavirus without resorting to lockdowns of the kind imposed in the UK, Italy and France. In contrast to the panic-buying witnessed elsewhere, South Koreans for the most part stayed calm. There were no reports of hoarding, and the only people queuing were waiting to be tested or to buy face masks … or to vote.By the time the World Health Organization issued its plea in mid-March for countries to “test, test, test”, South Korea had spent weeks doing just that, quickly developing the capability to test an average of 12,000 people – and sometimes as many as 20,000 – a day at hundreds of drive-through and walk-in testing centres. The mobile centres conducted the tests free of charge within 10 minutes, with the results were sent to people’s phones within 24 hours. By mid-March more than 270,000 people had been tested.Testing aside, South Korea – the most connected country in the world – also used mobile technology against the outbreak in the form of contact tracing. People who tested positive were asked to describe their recent movements, aided by GPS phone tracking, surveillance camera records and credit card transactions. Those details enabled the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to issue alerts, in real time, about where infected people had been before their positive status was confirmed.Amid criticism that the system could trample on privacy, the alerts contained only the gender and age category of each infected person, and names and addresses of the places they had visited.Jerome Kim, the director general of the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul, said South Korea had contained the virus through “decisive and transparent leadership based on data, not emotion.”Aside from testing people and tracking, isolating and treating those infected, the government convince millions of citizens to alter their behaviour, setting out clear principles for physical distancing, and companies were encouraged to allow employees to work from home.“There was compliance with advisories for social distancing and hygiene, like avoiding bars, churches, gyms and hagwon cram schools,” Kim said. “Voluntary cooperation by an informed populace has been a notable feature of the response.”South Korea had already learned a harsh lesson about the cost of delayed action. In 2015 the Middle East respiratory syndrome killed 36 people, infected 186 and forced thousands into quarantine in an outbreak traced to a single visitor from overseas.Its approach has inevitably attracted international attention. The president, Moon Jae-in, has embarked on a campaign of “coronavirus diplomacy” with other world leaders, and the country has exported test kits to at least 20 nations including the US.The government’s newly released playbook on how to contain the coronavirus, Flattening the curve on Covid-19: the Korean experience, says: “South Korea successfully flattened the curve on Covid-19 in 20 days without enforcing extreme draconian measures that restrict freedom and movement of people.”While health officials remain cautious for fear of a second wave of infections, life is slowly returning to a version of normality. This week restrictions on shops, restaurants, bars, gyms, cram schools and religious services – the latter the source of the country’s biggest single outbreak – were relaxed. National parks, forests and arboretums, which are believed to carry lower risks of infection, are set to open gradually, while physical distancing will remain in place until at least early May.“Until we reach herd immunity or we achieve similar levels with a safe and effective vaccine, the new normal, with a stress on hygiene, social distancing and potentially local crackdowns, may continue,” said Kim.The ruling party’s comfortable victory in last week’s national assembly elections has been interpreted as popular approval of the government’s handling of the crisis. But as in so many other countries, the highest praise is reserved for exhausted health workers.“I think the government has done a reasonably good job,” said Lee Mi-young, 35, who spent time in hospital after contracting the virus from her husband. “I know that other countries are looking to South Korea as the numbers have gone down here, but I think it is because of the hard work of health officials, not the politicians.”Whichever group deserves credit, South Koreans are eyeing a time in which Covid-19 is no longer the sole determinant of the way they live. There was evidence of that in Seoul this week where people were returning to work and flocking to shopping malls and restaurants.For Kim Tae-hyung, a 31-year-old engineer from Seoul, the cautious embrace of a post-pandemic world meant once again playing the game he loves.“I’m a member of a community football club and we went out to play on Saturday for the first time in two months,” he said. “We were wearing masks while we played, and we were still worried about the coronavirus. But the weather was lovely. And I felt refreshed.”Nemo Kim contributed reporting from Seoul."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d060bf777ed53aa0cc75b8e90d42753a79898da/0_451_1542_925/master/1542.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f01a8c95f2747905525b4b54b516baa8","title":"the volunteers making ppe on the homefront for uk healthworkers coronavirus","story":"Experienced machinists to first-time sewers are helping to provide coronavirus kitAs frontline medical staff continue to experience critical shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), people across the UK have been attempting to support health workers by creating their own.From retired fashion seamstresses and first-time sewers to faith groups and school teachers, the  has spoken to some of those working to make PPE at home.“Our youngest volunteer is a little boy of six with cystic fibrosis, he’s sewing away with his mum supervising. The oldest is a lady of 91 who just wanted to do her bit, so she’s adding buttons to all of the caps,” said Susan McDonnell, who runs a group of around 700 people across Somerset sewing scrubs and washbags for healthcare staff.“Some people in the group can’t sew, but I haven’t turned anybody away, we’ll find them jobs picking the orders or sorting things,” she said.Taunton, where McDonnell lives, used to house a factory making Pierre Cardin shirts, and many of the factory staff have come out of retirement to use their skills and industrial sewing machines to make clothes for healthcare staff.World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on face masks has remained consistent during the coronavirus pandemic. It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers – not the public.\u0026nbsp“Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,” the WHO has stated.There is no robust scientific evidence – in the form of trials – that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.Also underlying the WHO’s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play if everyone wears them.-\u0026nbspHow to make a non-medical coronavirus face mask – no sewing requiredThe group have set up a small warehouse in a local driving school, which has emptied due to the cancellation of classes. From here, materials are sent to volunteers sewing at home, and finished scrubs are collected and sorted, with the driving school staff responsible for deliveries. They are able to deliver up to 200 scrubs and 1,000 bags each day.Fabric has come from donations from local people, purchases by the volunteers, and fabric suppliers offering discounted rates. “Our volunteers have made such massive efforts, donating so much time and money even if they aren’t very well off. It’s a reminder that it’s not all doom, there are good things happening,” McDonnell added.In Redditch, Sarah Baker, a seamstress, had to close her studio when the pandemic cancelled all of her work. “With proms and wedding season, this is normally the busiest time of year, but all my work stopped, even down to shortening trousers,” she said.Her final customer before closing was an NHS nurse, who told her of the shortages of scrubs and asked if she might be able to make some. She found a pattern online, got it checked and approved, and joined a national group called For the Love of Scrubs, which coordinates sewing volunteers nationwide. Her scrubs are predominantly being sent to the local hospital where her son was born.“It’s fantastic,” she said. “I’m very happy to support them. It feels like a bit of a war effort, we’re all doing what we can.”Others are making visors for healthcare staff. At Chiltern academy in Bedfordshire, Dan Pallett, a design and technology teacher, discovered a growing movement of teachers across the UK using their resources to make PPE, and decided to join in. Colleagues in neighbouring schools offered to help, and the group now has almost 20 staff members, from PE teachers to administration staff.The PPE has predominantly been donated to local hospitals and care homes in and around Luton, but has also reached healthcare staff from Glasgow and the East of England ambulance service.Pallett is being supported by Discover Islam, a grassroots organisation in Luton that facilitates and highlights the contributions of the Muslim community to wider society. It has raised more than £20,000 to support local people during the coronavirus outbreak, and paid for almost all of the materials for the 7,500 visors produced at Chiltern academy, as well as providing lunch every day for Pallett’s volunteers.Sufian Sadiq, the chair of Discover Islam, said: “We came across Dan’s work and could see that it was difficult because you can’t buy all of the plastic out of school budgets. He has the skill, willingness and volunteers, but what he didn’t have was the resources. We said we’d provide whatever they needed in terms of finance and material to enable them to carry on production. We’re just so happy we can contribute.”In Ramsgate, Kent, Chatham \u0026amp Clarendon grammar school has been working with the local fire brigade over the past four weeks to make more than 20,000 visors, which have been sent to prisons, hospitals and doctors’ surgeries from London to Exeter.“It started with staff and students at the school, then ex-students and retired staff. Then other schools donated materials, and their staff wanted to get involved too. There are lots of local people who want to help out, even if it’s just dropping off tea and coffee,” said Thomas Brewin, head of design and technology at the school.“It gives a little bit of mental health support for those who want to help, people feel they’ve made a difference, and it is fun. I felt that if you’ve got the ability to do something, you’re almost obligated to step up,” he added. “It beats sitting at home.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b49a18be7cd5774242c0c47cdf6ef30fc583219/1253_40_1158_695/master/1158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10b785acb4db97f28ab8ff9c1f4cf833","title":"tories urge government to reveal details on easing uk lockdown coronavirus","story":"More transparency ‘desperately needed’ by businesses and the publicGrowing numbers of senior Tories are ramping up pressure on the government to provide details of how the lockdown could be eased, saying “the time is now” to give the public more information.Influential Conservatives, including former ministers, have said No 10 needs to be more transparent with the public and businesses on potential exit strategies and must deliver a statement on the issue soon.Nicola Sturgeon used her daily press conference on Thursday to explain how Scotland might lift restrictions on some businesses and allow pupils to return to school. Northern Ireland’s first minister, Arlene Foster, has also suggested she could lift restrictions before England.Iain Duncan Smith, the former leader of the Conservative party, told the  on Thursday: “The UK government now needs to recognise that the time is now. They need to bite the bullet and do it.”The government has so far said it does not want to give details of how the country might come out of the lockdown because it might lead to people no longer obeying the rules.Duncan Smith said: “My concern is that people are already beginning to do that. I’ve already noticed shops opening. I think they need to explain that we are not ready to come out yet but when we are, this is what’s going to happen.”He said Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was wrong to think that the government would lose control of restrictions by giving the public more information. Talks were going on within government privately on the way out of a lockdown, he suggested, and it was essential this was conveyed to the public as soon as possible.Theresa Villiers, the former environment secretary, said government advisers now needed to come forward with more details of what they perceived to be the exit route.She said: “We need a roadmap for a release from lockdown. I’m of course not saying that we should dispense with the advice of scientists and medics, but I think that ministers need to be more transparent now about how we will get to the point where the lockdown can be lifted because we need to give that hope to businesses who have been severely impacted by the crisis.“There is a case for a more transparent approach on all of this. I think the time has come where we need a clear signal about how and when we are going to return to a degree of normality.”My flight to Europe is cancelled. All I’m being offered is an alternative flight or vouchers. Is this legal?No. But that hasn’t stopped a number of airlines doing exactly that. All flights on EU carriers within, or into the EU, and all flights leaving from an EU airport, are protected by the EU’s “denied boarding” rules, which require a full refund in seven days when flights are cancelled.The problem for consumers is that enforcing these rights is proving very difficult. After initially promising to refund passengers within 20 working days, Ryanair has now said passengers should accept vouchers valid for 12 months, or wait until the Covid-19 pandemic is over for a refund.Refunds at British Airways are only being processed by customer services which, of course, is impossible to contact. easyJet, initially only offered refunds through customer services but now has a web portal to request refunds.Note: the EU cancellation rules do not apply to non-EU carriers where the flight started outside the EU – for example, a Korean Air flight from Seoul to London.In the face of a no-refund policy, what should I do?Taking the offer of replacement vouchers in the current climate is highly risky given the airline may not be around in six months. While some will be happy to accept vouchers, many will not.\u0026nbspCoby Benson of the specialist flight compensation lawyers, Bott\u0026nbspand Co, advises passengers to submit their refund request in writing, using the following text:If the airline does not respond or does not agree then the passenger can either issue court proceedings or use Alternative Dispute Resolution.If your flight cost more than £100 and was booked using a credit card, you can hold the card provider jointly liable. When things calm down we suspect many passengers will be forced down this route.\u0026nbspMy flight operated as scheduled but I was unable to go on it. What then?The fact that the government advised against all but essential travel means travel insurance policies should pay foreign trip cancellation claims provided you bought your policy before the pandemic was declared on 11 March.\u0026nbspCharles Walker, the vice-chair of the 1922 Committee of Tory MPs, said the government had not got its strategy wrong yet but “it’s got more to do to get it right”.Most prescient was bringing business leaders into the debate, he said. “It’s time to make them part of the conversation. Now is the time. That doesn’t mean ending lockdown tomorrow, but businesses need reassurance. The economy is lives – it’s not mutually exclusive.”The justice select committee chair, Bob Neill, said Boris Johnson should deliver the message himself when he has recovered from the coronavirus. He said while he remained concerned about a second wave of infection should restrictions be lifted, it was an appropriate time to have the discussion.“There comes a limit to people’s tolerance. People will go along with things if they know where we are. Ultimately scientists and medics are there to advise, but these are policy decisions so ultimately that means politicians are accountable and have to take that decision on board. Hopefully Boris Johnson will be back in the harness by then.”Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, a backbencher, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that he believed garden centres and DIY stores could be reopened with physical distancing measures.He said he accepted that opening up the country again could risk infection but businesses desperately needed support or could cease trading. “I think on behalf of the businesses of this country, begin to give them a little bit of hope as to when we might be able to get back to normality.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74bb0f1eb07c1558f3bb9cdfc221c972c34dd728/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3541f6e08475cf1eeac2e22410bfc2f","title":"tornadoes us south texas louisiana oklahoma mississippi","story":"At least six people were killed after severe storms tore through a number of southern states late on Wednesday, adding to weeks of extreme weather that had already killed more than two dozen people and destroyed hundreds of homes.More than two dozen tornadoes hit four states overnight.In Louisiana, a man was found dead after he lost his footing and was swept away by floodwaters. A witness reported the man was trying to retrieve a trash can from water near a drainage ditch.Some areas in Louisiana had experienced “extreme flooding” the likes of which Sheriff Jayson Richardson of DeSoto parish had not “seen in many, many years, if ever”.“Basically the water rose really fast and we had to rescue some people out of homes. I think we had about 20 or so homes that people were flooded in,” he told the Shreveport Times.“All resident students safe,” the school tweeted.Wednesday’s storms caused havoc in many rural communities, causing damage to factories at multiple facilities across the south.

Harvey has to take the lift to leave the building, which does not allow for social distancing.“When the lockdown first started, people were still cramming themselves into the lift. There must be people in the building who are shielding, who can’t get out at all because of the lift,” she said.“When our flats were built, they were aimed at single adults, but with the desperate need for social housing they’ve become homes for families, in buildings that were never intended for that. There isn’t a lot of space for young people to play,” she said. “There’s a resident garden with a notice saying no ball games.”Harvey and her son are two of many people in Britain living without their own access to green space. As the lockdown enters its second month, many are struggling without gardens or balconies to get fresh air and sunshine throughout the day. For them, the lockdown is a very different experience.“The current lockdown has created two classes of people : those with outdoor space and those that haven’t,” said David Nunn, 40, who lives in a second-floor flat in London. “If I had a garden over Easter I’d have been out there all day, having a BBQ, sunbathing, or gardening. For a lot of people living in cities, we don’t even have balconies. Once you’re inside your property, there’s nowhere else to go.”Nunn is considered to be at high risk of getting severe symptoms of coronavirus, so has been told to stay indoors for 12 weeks.“I can sit on the windowsill and the position of the sun in the late afternoon means I can dangle one leg out at a time,” he said. “That’s about it for my sunshine for now.”For many without their own green space, daily walks have become a lifeline.However, many parents are struggling to keep children exercised and entertained without gardens.“The gates on the local nature reserve have been closed, and all the local sports facilities have been shut down. Even the basketball hoops have been removed,” said Natasha Dunbar, who lives with her two daughters, aged 10 and 15, in a flat in Essex.Her youngest daughter, Jada, enjoys sport in school. “I’m getting on quite well, it’s been quite fun because I’ve been enjoying time with my family, but wish I had a garden and a bit of space, and a trampoline,” she said. “I really enjoy PE at school – I do gymnastics and swimming – and I miss it. A garden would give us more fun and exercise.”Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.“I’m finding it hard, especially on days like today when it’s hot out,” Dunbar said. “We have the window open, and go for walks, but it’s not the same as having a private space. I don’t think people with gardens know how hard it can be … The government keep saying we’re all in this together, but we aren’t.”“It’s really difficult for anyone with kids, especially young kids, because it’s hard to explain why everything’s changed,” said Sarah, a single parent of a two-year-old son who lives in a flat without any outside space in Somerset. “The play park we used to go to twice a day is locked up, and my son can’t understand why.”“I know we shouldn’t, but we have to go out twice a day, in the morning and afternoon,” she said, adding that they are careful to avoid others. “My son wouldn’t manage with no outdoor space. On the days we didn’t go out twice, it’s been tantrums and screaming fits, and he doesn’t sleep properly. He’s too young for arts and crafts, he just isn’t interested.”“I have friends with paddling pools, and swings, in the garden. I’ve just got the telly. It’s not the parent I want to be, I feel guilty about that,” she said.The lack of space and contact with other adults is impacting Sarah. “We used to go to the park, have playdates, go to nursery. We don’t get to do any of that. I miss people, and human interactions. I’m a single mum by choice, so I planned lots of things, but never for a global pandemic,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4246ac41ff907d42a2810a64f1a7bae130a3932b/0_26_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=687631ec2c457126fb77a611795c57fa","title":"uk making impossible demands over europol database in eu talks","story":"The British government is making impossible demands over access to Europol databases in the negotiations over the future relationship with the EU, according to a leaked assessment of the UK’s position drawn up by the German government.As talks between the two sides resumed via video calls this week, Britain’s negotiators not only refused to extend the transition period because of the Covid-19 pandemic, but also stated the UK side’s eagerness to continue taking part in EU-wide data-sharing arrangements and even expanding their reach.After 47 years and 30 days it was all over. As the clock struck 11pm on 31 January 2020, the UK was officially orced from the EU and began trying to carve out a new global role as a sovereign nation. It was a union that got off to a tricky start and continued to be marked by the UK’s sometimes conflicted relationship with its neighbours.The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain’s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a “deep-seated hostility” towards the European project.With Sir Edward Heath having signed the accession treaty the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.Lisa O\u0027CarrollMargaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the iron lady marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand “our own money back” claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back” despite being one of the “three poorer” members of the community.It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.\u0026nbspCollapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU.Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was ‘no, no, no’ to what she saw as Delors’ continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch’s Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered “Up yours Delors” front page.A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of “a single market without barriers – visible or invisible – giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world’s wealthiest and most prosperous people.Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union. John Major won the vote the following day in a pyrrhic victory.\u0026nbspTony Blair patches up the relationship. Signs up to social charter and workers\u0027 rights.Nigel Farage elected an MEP and immediately goes on the offensive in Brussels. “Our interests are best served by not being a member of this club,” he said in his maiden speech. “The level playing field is about as level as the decks of the Titanic after it hit an iceberg.”Chancellor Gordon Brown decides the UK will not join the euro.EU enlarges to to include eight countries of the former eastern bloc including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.EU expands again, allowing Romania and Bulgaria into the club.Anti-immigration hysteria seems to take hold with references to “cockroches” by Katie Hopkins in the Sun and tabloid headlines such as “How many more can we take?” and “Calais crisis: send in the dogs”.\u0026nbspDavid Cameron returns with reform package.According to a German government report on the UK’s position in the Brexit talks, seen by the , Britain wants to “approximate the position of a member state as closely as possible” when it comes to working with Europol, the EU’s law enforcement agency.This included a desire to continue to access Europol’s central intelligence database (EIS) – a wish the German report, summarising the EU’s position, described as “not possible”.Other data-sharing schemes the UK had expressed an interest in included the Schengen Information System (SIS II), a database used by European border control agencies that includes around 90m entries, as well as a vast collection of air passenger data (PNR), which British negotiators have proposed extending to cover those travelling on boats and by rail.Britain’s request for special access to these databases has been met with particularly vocal opposition in Germany, which has until now been seen as a more moderating influence in the negotiations but where data protection is a highly sensitive topic.Christian Petry, spokesperson for European affairs for the Social Democratic Party (SPD) that forms the German government with Angela Merkel’s conservatives, told the  he was “very critical” of British claims to levels of control and influence on security affairs usually reserved for members of the EU and the passport-free Schengen zone.“The Brexiteers have always disparaged the EU as undemocratic,” Petry said. “To now dictate to the EU as a third country how we should organise our inner security, that would indeed be undemocratic. It would not only be ‘cherry-picking on speed’, but set a fatal precedent. With what arguments could we respond to wishes from other states with similar ideas?”The German Green party said Britain could only hope to take part in data-sharing schemes if it accepted the EU’s standards for data protection, and therefore the jurisdiction of the European court of justice.“Otherwise we are endangering the basic rights of our citizens, which is not something we can tolerate,” said Franziska Brantner of the German Greens, who are currently second in polls to Merkel’s CDU. “Rights also come with responsibilities”.UK officials have argued in the negotiations that they are making a pragmatic offer of strong cooperation and that a refusal to engage with the proposals will lead to a mutual loss in capability to fight crime and terrorism.Sources suggested that those who claimed the UK was trying to attain the benefits of membership while outside the EU were misrepresenting the British position.The UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, has repeatedly emphasised that his stance builds on relationships the EU has with other so-called “third countries” not in the bloc.But some German politicians are particularly indignant at the idea that the UK could continue to take part in the Schengen Information System (SIS), since the decision to allow Britain to take part in the scheme five years ago has already proven controversial.A 2018 report by the Council of the European Union found that the UK was making improper use of the database by illegally copying classified personal information and sharing it with US companies.“It is nothing short of brazen by the British government to want to take part in Europe’s largest police database in spite of repeatedly breaking its rules,” said Andrej Hunko, a spokesman on European affairs for Die Linke, the German left party.“Instead, the commission must initiate an immediate expulsion from SIS, as officials in Great Britain still refuse to address a list of deficiencies compiled by the European commission in January.” Hunko said his party would “put up resistance” against the British proposals in Germany and at an EU level.EU officials said the last week of negotiations covering trade, police and judicial cooperation and governance of the future relationship, had not made any significant progress. “There is a chasm,” said the source.The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, is expected to offer an uncompromising view when he speaks to reporters on Friday.A Home Office spokesman said: “The safety and security of our citizens is the government’s top priority and we are working closely with the European Union to reach an agreement on law enforcement and criminal justice cooperation in criminal matters that works for both of us.“The agreement should equip operational partners on both sides with the capabilities that help protect citizens and bring criminals to justice – promoting the security of all our citizens.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/073ee6bd292ced927818773f551fb00441c94f73/0_275_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f438db195c1974e4812569de96a9f74","title":"uk muslims embrace technology for ramadan","story":"Mosques are on lockdown and turning to social media to keep in touchFrom rustling up meals to break the fast using recipes on YouTube to listening to sermons via Zoom, this year’s Ramadan will be unique for Britain’s estimated 2.6 million Muslims with a reliance on technology due to coronavirus.With the first day of fasting due on Friday or Saturday, depending on the sighting of the new moon, mosques in the UK are adapting to the lockdown measures by turning to social media and apps to keep in touch with worshippers by livestreaming motivational lectures, courses and prayers.Facebook Live, Instagram, the Houseparty app and YouTube are expected to be among the sources for those abstaining from food and drink from sunrise to sunset each day to prevent any potential spiritual vacuum caused by the closure of places of worship since late March.Imran Choudhury, 31, from Luton, a mosque volunteer, believes Islamic places of worship have an opportunity to connect with young Muslims via technology.He said: “The mosques for me are spiritual hubs, a place where I can recharge my faith in God. Now that they are closed it’s become really important that I fill that spiritual void.“There’s only so much you can listen to on YouTube but having a live connection with your imam and local scholars through Mixlr, GoMeet or Zoom, is a great way of keeping spirits high.“I think, in a positive way, this will definitely become the norm even after things have calmed down.“By using these platforms, the mosques are also capturing the attention of a demographic which have been increasingly hard to reach – the youth. I know many young people are listening to sermons from their local mosques as opposed to the usual ‘social media’ scholars online.”Mosques around the country are traditionally full with a congregation for the daily Taraweeh night prayers which often finish around midnight. For the next 29 or 30 days of Ramadan, those prayers along with the five daily prayers will be undertaken from home.The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, actor Riz Ahmed and television presenter Konnie Huq are among the prominent British personalities who have collaborated for a new coronavirus advice video for the #RamadanAtHome campaign.Among the mosques using conferencing apps to connect virtually with Muslims in lockdown are the Bury Park Jamie Masjid and Leagrave Hall Masjid in Luton.Ashfaque Chowdhury, a member of the management team at Leagrave Hall Masjid, said: “Covid-19 has had tremendous impact on communities and has isolated them to their homes with little availability of spiritual moral social, cultural and mental health support.“To rise to the challenge, Leagrave Hall Masjid has digitised its facilities online with live Friday sermons via Mixlr and GoMeet.“Prayers for the deceased are now performed with their families online via go to meeting and Google classrooms is used to keep the teaching of the Qur’an alive amongst the young people.”Finsbury Park mosque in north London will be streaming lectures and prayers and offering online counselling while volunteers will distribute food to staff at local hospitals.Cambridge Muslim College is hosting a curated series of daily online talks from scholars on topics including the Qur’an, hadith, self-improvement, arts, culture and astronomy.Other virtual initiatives include the Ramadan Tent Project, where people sign up to receive recipes, decorations and games and can participate in a virtual Iftar via the Zoom app.With many restaurants closed and government advice to avoid visiting friends and family, Muslims are increasingly turning to bloggers and chefs on social media for inspiration for recipes to prepare the morning Suhoor meal at dawn and the evening meal at around 9pm.They include Alia Al Kasimi, a chef of Moroccan heritage, who has 357,000 YouTube subscribers.Bilal El Amri, 36, a facilities assistant in London, will be turning to the Cooking with Alia YouTube channel for inspiration.He said: “This year I will watch a recipe video three or four times, write down ingredients, see if I have them in the fridge, buy the ingredients I need then come back and start cooking to the recipe.“Alia’s website and YouTube channel has so many recipes which remind me of my Moroccan background.“Things I haven’t tasted for months or even years. It makes me feel close to my family, it triggers part of my muscle memory from the past.“I make tagines, harira soup, lots of mezes with olives. On a weekend I will make a fish cake.”He added: “Normally during Ramadan I would go to my cousin’s house to break the fast a few times, invite friends round, or prepare food with my wife and then go to the masjid.“With my cousins in London we will have a Skype video conference, we can even pray together virtually.”The Muslim Council of Britain has published guidelines on how to celebrate Ramadan in lockdown with advice on how to arrange “virtual iftars” online with family, friends and community members by using video chat.The guidelines also encourage people to buy food for the iftar meal in advance to avoid multiple shopping trips.It says: “Due to the likely inability to host in-person iftars this Ramadan, one way to connect with friends and loved ones is to host ‘virtual iftars’, in which iniduals or families can join via video conferencing facilities like Zoom, FaceTime or video-calling apps like Skype or WhatsApp.“This could be an important way for iniduals to stay connected during these times, especially for those who are living alone or away from family.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd269af1ae0ddd453e87e877c926eff82b381b6d/0_352_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9ce2ff1ffd9ef23e108fb1f9e1fddd6","title":"what would year physical distancing mean for uk","story":"Some restrictions likely to be gradually eased but older people may be stuck at homeThe public have been warned to brace themselves for another year of physical distancing measures, with the chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, saying it is time to be realistic about what lies ahead.But what would a new normal of physical distancing look like?Construction and manufacturing are likely to be at the forefront of a phased return that would be based on a traffic-light system, particularly given the pressure from Conservative MPs. The government recently issued guidance saying such work could continue if done in line with physical distancing rules “wherever possible”.Shops could return next, subject to reduced opening hours and strict rules on customer numbers at any one time, , including DIY retailers and garden centres, plus hairdressers.In terms of non-essential services, they could be followed by restaurants and pub, though again with physical distancing on tables and a cap on customer numbers.Last to come back would be arts and culture, including cinemas and theatres, while Premier League football matches would initially be played behind closed doors, perhaps with some screened on free-to-air TV. The National Theatre is hoping to reopen in July while planning for scenarios that might push it back as late as January or beyond. The government said in March it would be contacting 1.5 million people to tell them they should be “shielding” on account of being at a higher risk due to factors such as their age or underlying health conditions.That number could grow. The increase would be driven by information provided by GPs tasked with finding out more about other patients.If such groups have to confine themselves to their homes for another year, or until a vaccine is ready, then enhancements are likely to be made to processes including the employment of an army of volunteers and online delivery systems.One approach that has been discussed by policymakers, and proposed by researchers such as those at Warwick University, involves a youth-first policy allowing for younger worker in their 20s and 30s who no longer live with their parents to return to work first.While younger groups are not impervious to Covid-19, they are regarded as the most resilient. Such an approach has led some to joke there could even be a maximum drinking age in the bars that might open at the same time.By contrast, vulnerable and older people – specifically those aged above 70 – might have to remain in their homes for at least another year or until a vaccine is developed.While there is a case for reopening smaller schools first, one proposal is for secondary schools and above to open initially, as older students would be more likely – in theory – to abide by physical distancing and travel by themselves. In England the most likely are years 10 and 12 - the first years of GCSE and A-levels respectively.In terms of primaries, one idea floating around government is that year 6 – comprising 10- and 11-year-olds – could be allowed back. Other proposed measures include staggering opening times, capping numbers and hours, altering term times and providing protective equipment for staff in some instances.Britons have not been ordered to wear masks in public, although this could become more commonplace if mayors including London’s Sadiq Khan continue to back the measure.But it appears other measures, including floor markings inside and outside supermarkets, are here to stay and may well be expanded. Temperature screening, of the type that customers in China’s shops and travellers at some international airports have become used to, could also appear.A concept that could gain traction again is that of immunity passports for people who have antibodies after previously contracting coronavirus. But this is complicated, not least by problems with testing, unsettled science around immunity and fears some may want to become deliberately infected.Amid an unprecedented global surge in digital surveillance, many might also be concerned by steps towards tracking of the type credited in South Korea with helping to suppress the pandemic there at an early stage.An NHS app is being tested that would allow people to report their symptoms and then anonymously alert other users that have been in contact with that person in recent days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5453f5d5b00e1ccd5a0b0906ff914971429827e8/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=087c46ce7e1f2c6da2c20ebd5724c5f5","title":"why the uk is finding it so hard to reach 100000 covid 19 tests a day","story":"A slow start, a top-down approach and long-term cuts to local services meant target was always going to be ambitiousOn 2 April, the day he emerged from quarantine after testing positive for Covid-19, Matt Hancock stood at the Downing Street podium for the daily coronavirus press conference and made an announcement that was greeted in some quarters by a sharp intake of breath.“I’m now setting the goal of 100,000 tests per day by the end of this month. That is the goal and I’m determined we’ll get there,” said the health secretary, who had tested positive around a week earlier.It amazed many observers, but it wasn’t the most ambitious testing target the government had put forward. On 25 March, under pressure on testing and claiming the UK was doing better than other countries, the prime minister said: “We are going up from 5,000 to 10,000 tests per day, to 25,000, hopefully very soon up to 250,000 per day.”But even the lower numbers have never stacked up. With less than a week to go until his self-imposed deadline, and in spite of buoyant talk by ministers and advisers, many believe that the 100,000 target to which Hancock so firmly committed himself will also be missed.A massive effort to set up big new laboratories and engage smaller ones, the “little ships”, to help, along with a plan for 50 drive-through centres, has increased capacity. But with a week to go, the UK finds itself with capacity for 40,000 tests a day – and only half that number being carried out. It is well short of the pledge and, more importantly, if the intention is for the UK to test its way out of lockdown, it is not enough.If the target is missed, there is a risk that blame may be deflected on to the tens of thousands of health workers and key workers themselves. Hancock has already said that they are not turning up at the drive-through centres in the numbers expected. But in fact nurses and doctors have ended up self-isolating because of the long distances they would have to drive to get tested – and there have been stories of some being turned away when they get there.And as strategists and politicians start to map out the exit from lockdown, the question of resources for local public health teams that have been stripped back over a decade of austerity will become increasingly urgent. The regular – perhaps weekly – testing of those on the frontline and tracking down contacts has to be done locally. It cannot be run, as so much of the epidemic response has been, from Westminster.But to understand how that pledge has begun to seem so out of reach, it is essential to look at how the government’s approach to it began: slowly. The UK started ramping up testing too late, having abandoned it as a core principle on 12 March, when Johnson declared the virus could no longer be contained. People with symptoms should just stay at home, he said. Only hospital patients would be tested. Thus Britain went to the back of the queue for testing kits, reagents and other commodities that the world was scrambling for.Testing, followed by contact tracing and quarantine, is the standard public health response to an infectious disease epidemic, supported loudly by the World Health Organization, whose director general said it should be “the backbone of the response in every country”. The UK had other ideas, but as the numbers admitted to hospital rose and NHS staff began to stay at home because they or their family fell ill, the calls for testing became more vocal.Promises began to be made. In an odd disconnect, NHS and Public Health England had said they intended to reach 10,000 tests a day on 11 March, the day before Johnson declared the containment phase over and said people with symptoms should stay home untested. Just 1,215 people had been tested by that stage.The issue got hotter. On 18 March, Johnson declared the UK would do 25,000 tests a day, but did not say when. On 29 March, Hancock tweeted that they had reached the 10,000 target and were on course for 25,000. The watchdog organisation Full Fact, however, later said the data did not support the claim. The highest number tested in a day in England at that time had been 9,114.On 2 April, Hancock made the pledge that threatens to “come back and bite him”, according to the  this week, citing “a No 10 insider”. They would do 25,000 tests a day by mid- to late April, and 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month.With the prime minister in isolation in Downing Street with symptoms, and a need to quash difficult questions about why the UK lagged behind, the health secretary made some admissions.Unlike Germany, the UK did not have a huge diagnostics industry, he said, so had been “catching up”. He acknowledged that global demand had led to a shortage of both swabs and reagents. The swabs issue had been fixed but “we are still tackling the reagents issue, which is a global challenge”, he said.In a rare moment, he admitted that the government had not got everything right: “There will be criticisms made, and some of them will be justified.” But he also had a reassuringly substantial-sounding plan for what was next, from bringing in commercial partners to scaling up Britain’s diagnostic capacity: the ”five pillars”.However many pillars there were, 100,000 tests a day was such a big number that it was assumed the government was including antibody tests to demonstrate people had been infected in the past, as well as the PCR swab tests for people with symptoms.The government had been enthusiastic about the possibility of a fingerprick antibody test that anyone could do at home, like a pregnancy test. Johnson on 19 March said: “To give you an idea of what is coming down the track, we’re in negotiations today to buy a so-called antibody test, as simple as a pregnancy test, which can tell whether you have had the disease. It’s early days, but if it works as its proponents claim, then we will buy literally hundreds of thousands of these kits as soon as practicable. Because obviously it has the potential to be a total game-changer.”Public Health England’s director of infections, Prof Sharon Peacock, elaborated on 25 March, telling the science and technology committee of MPs that a simple home test would be available within days.So the 100,000 tests are PCR swab tests for current viral infection only, and all the stops have been pulled out to get there. On Wednesday, the Department for Health and Social Care hailed the “biggest network of diagnostic labs in British history”, built in five weeks flat. Three mega-labs would process samples from 27 of the planned 50 drive-through centres. Dozens of universities, research institutes and companies were lending equipment. The UK’s two biggest drug companies, Astra Zeneca and GlaxoSmithKline, are collaborating on a fourth lab in Cambridge.And yet, only half the daily 40,000 test capacity is being used. Hancock talked of lower than expected demand and has opened the scheme to other key workers outside the NHS, including social care workers, police, prison officers, social workers and benefits staff.But there is a fundamental problem. Key workers don’t want a long drive at the end of a gruelling shift to get tested.“What I’m hearing from the frontline is that nurses are driving up to two hours, feeling very unwell with possible symptoms of coronavirus, to testing stations, and sometimes if you haven’t got an appointment you’re turned away and told to come back another time,” Dame Donna Kinnair, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, told the health and social care select committee.The British Medical association estimated on Wednesday that nearly 100,000 health workers were self-isolating because the testing sites were not easy to get to.Prof John Ashton, former regional director of public health for north-west England, said the government’s battle plan against Covid-19 had been so centralised and top-down that they hadn’t asked people what would work for them in their locality.“You have to go to them. They should be testing them as they leave work,” he said. “It’s the same issue with immunisation.” Offering nurses flu jabs in the hospital as they arrive or go home has successfully raised rates in the past.Importantly, testing is not an end in itself. When the UK attempts to lift the lockdown, testing, tracing the contacts of anyone who is positive and ensuring they isolate themselves is essential. Key workers running higher risks may have to be tested weekly. That needs to be run locally, by people who understand the community they live and work in.In the 1970s, Liverpool had 6,000 public health staff, including community nurses, health visitors, food hygiene staff and many others. “Now they’d be lucky to have 30 or 40 staff,” he said. “Bolton has got four in its public health team.”The epidemic will not behave in the same way in every part of Britain. Once out of UK-wide lockdown, cases will flare in one region or another, and the best firefighters will be local public health teams. These are people who know their communities. It is the local teams, says Ashton, who could have made the next chapter less disastrous than the current one.“They are the ones that should be leading on contact tracing and testing programmes,” he said. “This can’t be done from Whitehall.” The problem is, in many cases, they barely exist."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bbab8916099c1db3ca7610596ac9d057896bb31/0_194_5870_3524/master/5870.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=098e71ea152389644e35e176e5c760c0","title":"animals roaming streets coronavirus lockdown photos","story":"Animals have started taking advantage of cities as they enter lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.

If you’d like to continue following the ’s coverage of the pandemic, head over to our global live blog.Here are the main points from Matt Hancock’s press conference.Test, track and trace, done effectively, can help to suppress the transmission in a way that allows you then to have lesser rules.Jeremy Hunt, the Conservative former health secretary who has been pushing for a mass contract tracing programme, said this meant the UK now had “a clear exit route from the current lockdown”. (See 6pm.)From today, employers of essential workers will be able to go on gov.uk to get a test for any of their staff. From tomorrow, any essential workers who need a test will be able to book an appointment on gov.uk themselves, directly. This all applies for people in essential workers’ households too who need a test. It’s all part of getting Britain back on her feet.We have also introduced new tests, new types of test, so for example at least two NHS labs are now using a test that has no RNA extraction stage, which means no need for the chemical reagents which are in such high demand around the world.In addition, we have the three new lighthouse labs which are all now on stream - these are the ones in Milton Keynes, in Manchester and in Glasgow.Each of these labs will be able to process tens of thousands of tests per day and we’re introducing automation into those processes which really ramps up the capacity.We are currently on track to reach 100,000 tests a day. In fact, we’re somewhat ahead of where we thought we’d be at this stage.The increase in confirmed cases of Covid-19 within prisons continues to slow, according to daily figures released by the Ministry of Justice.The figures reflect the total number of recorded positive cases of Covid-19 and include iniduals who have recovered. The Prison Service is to temporarily release up to 4,000 inmates who are within two months of their release date, as well as build 500 cells within the existing prison estate to increase single-cell occupancy.Jeremy Hunt, the Conservative former health secretary, who has been leading calls for the implementation of a mass contact tracing programme, has welcomed what Matt Hancock has announced today.From our colleague Lisa O’CarrollTeaching unions and school leaders have welcomed the announcement that school staff will get priority for testing, with some calling it an essential precondition before reopening schools.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said:School staff have been on the frontline in the national response to coronavirus. We have been clear from the start that governments across the UK understand they must honour this effort with the appropriate level of support and safety. If testing can be delivered effectively, then it will be welcomed by the education sector.Kevin Courtney of the National Education Union said the immediate priority was for teachers who were self-isolating to get tested.Our call for testing has been unceasing. The government has been slow to respond, and there will be a fear amongst school staff that this promise will follow the pattern of previous pledges to contain the virus. Our members will not tolerate dither and delay. They need certainty and, from the health secretary, swift action to make this promise a reality.Q: Why has the UK government been unable to produce a plan like the Scottish government’s?Hancock says the UK has set out its own five tests. Having the four nations of the UK work together on this has been important. The country has “essentially moved together”, he says. The UK-wide approach “is the best way to go”, he says.Vallance says the scientists from the four nations all work together. It is a unified approach, he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e2744ff9392ef576006f10de12085241db8b978/0_14_5273_3165/master/5273.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c6620a58a655778162b53a3c92f0d93","title":"coronavirus live news us states start to reopen as detained wuhan journalist reappears","story":"Unemployment in US up by 4.4 million to a total of over 26 million world has ‘a long way to go’, warns WHO chief Iran reports lowest new daily infections for a monthUK prime minister Boris Johnson will be back at work as soon as Monday, the  reports.

The message was not unexpected as the number of Covid-19 cases has doubled in the last nine days to 20,194 with 572 deaths and rising patient numbers, reported at 2,786, which are putting hospitals under pressure. Reuters reports cases of bodies being kept in hallways, masks being reused, and protests from medical workers concerned about their safety.“The most important thing in Peru is its people,” said Vizcarra announcing the two-week extension. “These are the efforts we have to make to beat this disease.” He added “lifestyle changes” like social distancing and using a mask would have to become habits until there was a vaccine.“To begin with, there was skepticism, they said it was an exaggeration,” the president said, referring to the quarantine measures.Cameroon has freed over 1,300 prisoners in its two main cities in an effort to ease overcrowding and limit the spread of the coronavirus, officials have said.President Paul Biya signed a decree to commute sentences and free some prisoners in April, AFP reports. The country’s justice minister said that 608 prisoners had been freed in Doula, the economic capital, and another 700 released in the capital Yaounde.More prisoners in other areas are in the process of being released, the ministry said, with the exact number to be determined by commissions put in place to study who is eligible.Cameroon has officially registered 1,163 coronavirus infections and 42 deaths, making it the second most affected country in sub-Saharan Africa after South Africa.Cameroon has a prison population of around 30,000 with more than half of those awaiting sentencing and mostly held in overcrowded facilities. As well as overcrowding, poor hygiene conditions and a high rate of illnesses including tuberculosis, cholera and AIDS make the prison populations vulnerable.This follows warnings from criminal justice experts that chronic overcrowding and underfunding have left prisons around the world vulnerable to being devastated by the coronavirus.European Union leaders have clashed over how to rescue their economies from an economic slump caused by the coronavirus pandemic and forecast to be unparalleled since the 1930s Great Depression, Jennifer Rankin reports.Meeting via video-conference summit, as the confirmed Covid-19 death toll passed 108,000 lives across the European Economic Area and UK, the 27 leaders instructed the head of the EU executive Ursula von der Leyen to draft a recovery plan.Read the full report here.Armenia has turned off street lights nationwide as President Armen Sarkisian acknowledged the coronavirus lockdown altered the annual commemoration of the victims of WWI-era genocide by Ottoman Turks.In the capital Yerevan, a torch-lit procession traditionally held annually on 23 April had been cancelled and access was closed to the genocide memorial. Instead, street lights were switched off and church bells chimed across the country, while many lit candles or mobile phone flashlights at windowsills.The 105th anniversary of the tragedy “is commemorated in accordance with a protocol forced on us by the (coronavirus) pandemic,” President Sarkisian said in a statement. “We remember our victims all the time and everywhere, no matter where in the world we are.” Last month, Armenia - which has reported 1,401 coronavirus cases and 22 deaths - declared a state of emergency and imposed a nationwide lockdown to slow the spread of the infection.Armenians say up to 1.5 million people were killed during World War I as the Ottoman Empire was falling apart, a claim supported by many other countries. Turkey continues to reject the genocide label.Nina Lakhani has written in from New York with the latest on the pandemic’s forecasted economic effects: Global remittances are projected to plummet by about 20 percent - or $109 billion - in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic which has pushed the world towards recession, according to the World Bank. Jason Burke, the ’s Africa correspondent, has written this dispatch on how South Africa will begin to ease its lockdown:South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa spoke to the nation for the second time in three days on Thursday night, giving 56 million people the good news that the very strict lockdown that they have endured for nearly month would be lifted at the end of the month, but undoubtedly disappointing some by making it very clear that changes to the lives of many would not be substantial.So far South Africa, which has been praised for its pro-active strategy of screening and testing to contain the Covid-19 virus, has nearly 4,000 confirmed cases and has suffered 75 deaths. Ramaphosa announced a shift to a system of five levels. The total lockdown - where any movement out of the home is banned - is now designated level five and can be restored if necessary. But from May 1st South Africa will move to level four, which will allow “some activity to resume subject to extreme precautions”. Few further details were immediately available though Ramaphosa mentioned the phased reopening of schools. The country’s borders will remain shut however. Level three would allow some social activities, but even level two would mean a continuing ban on religious services, sporting events, concerts, cinema and similar gatherings. Ramaphosa stressed the risk of a new surge of infections, and though the president did not mention the coming winter, experts have repeatedly warned that the month ahead are likely to be difficult. Very significant restrictions look set to remain in place for six months at least. “Let us stay strong and united,” Ramaphosa, a popular leader who took power in 2018 and won an election last year, said. Dubai has become the latest city to ease lockdown restrictions, announcing that cafes and restaurants are to reopen with a maximum capacity of 30 per cent. Reuters reports public transportation services, including the subway, will resume from 26 April. Shopping malls will also be partially reopened.The Czech Republic is speeding up plans to relax its coronavirus lockdown by two weeks to get all shops, restaurants and hotels running again by May 25 as the number of infections stabilises, Reuters reports.The central European country has used drastic measures including shop and school closures, limiting people’s daily movements and making masks obligatory in public in an effort to prevent any uncontrolled spike in the new coronavirus.With the number of cases declining in recent days, it had planned a cautious lifting of restrictions between this week and June 8. Business lobbies had criticised the schedule as being too slow.Industry minister Karel Havlicek said on Thursday the slowing of new infections since the Easter holiday weekend had been good enough for the government to move faster.“We evaluated Easter, the results are very promising,” Havlicek told a televised news briefing. “There will be 14-day intervals (in the re-opening), at the moment (the schedule) roughly copies what is done in Germany or Austria.”The country has seen the daily increase of reported cases drop to an average of 119 in the past week, less than half of what was being recorded in early April. The virus’s reproduction factor has dropped to 0.73, according to Havlicek. A figure below the neutral level of 1 means the epidemic is on the decline.It has reported a total of 7,138 cases since the start of March, and the number of active cases fell below 5,000 on Wednesday for the first time since April 8. Havlicek said the easing may be reversed if the situation worsens again.The country has recorded 210 deaths of people who had tested positive for the coronavirus.Peru’s reported coronavirus cases have rapidly increased this week, reaching 20,914 on Thursday. The country has the second highest number of cases in South America after Brazil despite introducing tough lockdown measures.The health ministry says it expects patient numbers to peak within the following week, as hospitals strain to deal with the sharp rise in infections. Reuters reports cases of bodies being kept in hallways, masks being reused, and protests from medical workers concerned about their safety.Peru has recorded 572 deaths, and the number of recorded coronavirus cases in the country has doubled in the last nine days.Hello, I’ll be taking over the live blog for the next few hours.

Thanks in advance.Here are the latest lines from our global coronavirus news coverage.The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Turkey increased to 101,790 on Thursday, the Turkish health minister said. The country registered 115 Covid-19 deaths and 3,116 new cases in the past 24 hours, Fahrettin Koca said on his official Twitter account. With the latest figures, Turkey’s fatalities have reached 2,491. A four-day lockdown began in 31 Turkish cities including Ankara and Istanbul on Thursday, and will last until midnight Sunday, in a bid to curb the spread of the virus, AFP reports. The government has already taken a series of measures including shutting schools and universities, banning mass gatherings and closing public spaces such as restaurants.An experimental drug that had touted as a potentially effective treatment for coronavirus has flopped in its first comprehensive clinical trial, according to draft results accidentally published online by the World Health Organisation. According to a report in the Financial Times, which saw the documents, remdesivir failed to improve the condition of patients or reduce the among of the virus in the blood. The trial, in China, studied the effects of remdesivir on 237 patients, giving the drug to 158, while keeping 79 others as a control group. Optimism about the drug, made by US drug company Gilead Sciences, had boosted stock markets around the world at the end of last week. A University of Chicago hospital participating in a study of the antiviral medication had found that nearly all patients suffering severe fever and respiratory symptoms were discharged within a week. However, it was not an official trial.

He added that they were doing this with the stakeholders - the students, parents, the unions and the different patron bodies.He said that he had spoken to his British counterpart Gavin Williamson over concerns for the 4,000 Irish applicants.He was responding to Sinn Féin TD Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire who said he had been contacted by the father of a student who had received two conditional offers from UK universities to study medicine.“Both universities are insisting that those offers will be lost unless Leaving Cert results are issued before August 31st,” Mr Ó Laoghaire said.Mr McHugh has spoken to the British education secretary, and the Department of Education secretary general had been in touch with his British counterpart.He said “this is something we need to find a solution to.”Exam feeMr McHugh also announced that the deadline for the €116 Leaving Cert exam fee will be extended from April 30th until after the exams are completed.However, Labour TD Aodhán Ó Ríordáin called for the fee to be abolished entirely due to the financial pressure facing many families this year.“Students shouldn’t be charged €116 for the privilege of sitting the exam this year, particularly given the financial circumstances many families in this country now find themselves in,” Mr O Ríordáin said.Many Opposition TDs also raised the issue of stress and anxiety facing this year’s Junior and Leaving Cert exam students given what they described as an ongoing lack of clarity over aspects of the exams.In response, Mr McHugh announced that plans are being finalised for a new system of mental health supports to help protect students’ wellbeing.He said this outreach support will be delivered in conjunction with the Department of Health.Mr McHugh also announced that thousands of parents will be provided with refunds for school transport, on the basis that it has not been available to children over recent weeks.“I have decided that at the end of the school year when the exact impact in terms of numbers of weeks of school closure is known, a refund for that period of closure will be issued to parents,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: ReutersMassimo PincaPressure has increased on the Government to require that face masks be worn routinely by the public to contain the Covid-19 virus, in line with a change in scientific opinion in favour of the measure.Scientists and TDs have called for the change based on indication that basic face masks in social settings can prevent the spread of coronavirus.Meanwhile, the Irish Nurses \u0026amp Midwives Organisation has welcomed a change in national policy, which now mandates surgical face masks in all settings for any healthcare workers who provide care within 2m of a patient including where social distancing cannot be maintained.The Health Information and Quality Authority, which advises the Government and HSE on healthcare standards, said it is “currently reviewing international evidence on the effectiveness of face masks at reducing the transmission of respiratory viruses, including Covid-19, both in healthcare settings and in the community”.This review would be published shortly, a Hiqa spokeswoman said.In newly published guidelines, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises the wearing of basic masks including those made of cloth for all people in public spaces. Many other countries support the wearing of masks in such circumstances, while it is standard practice in many Asian countries in response to epidemics.The World Health Organisation, however, has not advised such action though it is reviewing the latest scientific evidence. In the past, it has warned that face masks can facilitate spread of the coronavirus, especially if they are used incorrectly. It has also highlighted the critical need for higher spec face masks to be available for healthcare workers at a time of shortage of personal protection equipment (PPE).Asymptomatic spreadA growing number of scientists, however, accept basic face masks may not prevent infection for a wearer but can protect others by not transmitting the virus they may not know they have – known as asymptomatic spread.Immunologist Prof Luke O’Neill of Trinity College Dublin said he believed people will soon be required to wear masks in public. He strongly recommended people wear them when going outside, citing evidence that when infected people speak they produce aerosols that carry the virus.Infectious diseases specialist Prof Sam McConkey of RCSI has also backed the wearing of masks by the public, but warned of unacceptable risk if it resulted in a shortage for frontline staff at a time when there is pressure to source PPE.People Before Profit TD Bríd Smith called on HSE officials on Wednesday to prepare a plan to make face masks freely and widely available for the general public and those who wish to wear them in public places.“We see this happening in other European cities and countries, so I think it’s right that any member of the public who is expected to return to work or school should have such masks freely available if they wish to wear them,” she added.She welcomed the change in policy on the use of protective equipment for healthcare workers, adding the change was especially welcome in nursing home settings. “The previous guidance was insane given the catastrophe we see in nursing homes, and the ability of the virus to spread via asymptomatic carriers.”INMO general secretary Phil Ní Sheaghdha said the revised policy was welcome news for frontline staff and patients, which should ease some anxiety and reduce transmission of the virus.“This should have been rolled out weeks ago, but we are glad to have finally secured this measure. It will not only benefit frontline healthcare workers, but will reduce the risk of transmission to patients.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Commission for Aviation Regulation states customers can also accept a voucher insteadPartnership shows how media and business can \u0026lsquorespond in the face of adversity\u0026rsquoThe plans are subject to public consultation with submissions accepted until late MayDublin diocese pilgrimage will now take place virtually due to Covid-19 pandemicA pilot contact tracing scheme to begin early next weekNursing Home Ireland says \u0026lsquoheralded redeployment\u0026rsquo not happening amid \u0026lsquohuge crisis\u0026rsquoTony Holohan warns against complacency, pointing increased seismilogical activityNursing Homes Ireland says redeployment urgent as many staff absent due to Covid-19Major security operation was required during 48 hour visit to Ireland by British royals\u0026lsquoDiscrepancy\u0026rsquo in temporary wage subsidy affects women back from maternity leavePaula Hilman officially leaves North\u0026rsquos force to take up Garda assistant commissioner roleNew figures show that the rate of transmission for coronavirus is being suppressedFianna F\u0026aacuteil\u0026rsquos finance spokesman Michael McGrath says decisions on public finances \u0026lsquofor another day\u0026rsquoSome 263 have died in hospital setting in region as confirmed cases reach 3,016Orlaith Fahy failed fitness test and was unable to complete BA in Applied policingClare man (86) who used son as \u0026lsquosexual plaything\u0026rsquo is serving four year sentenceMark Burke\u0026rsquos wife and children dressed in PPE and went to say goodbye to him in ICUBoy allegedly hit one of the teachers in his secondary school with a brush lastyearStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4236412.1587673160!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"an post and irish times team up to deliver news to your home","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe new  delivery service with An Post helps readers throughout the State keep up to date, particularly those cocooned in their homes.

Photograph: LivelineA 47-year-old man who contracted coronavirus and whose family was told he only had 24 hours to live has recovered from the illness and his medical records will now be used for research to help treat the virus worldwide.Mark Burke, from Co Wicklow, was in ICU in St Vincent’s Hospital, Dublin, for four weeks. He developed a problem with his bowels, his lungs were failing, and medics believed he would not survive. His family were told to say goodbye to him.Mr Burke’s wife and children dressed in PPE and went to say goodbye to him while he was in ICU.“When the kids walked in, he opened his eyes he heard their voices. If you saw it in a movie, you wouldn’t believe it. You would think that it is so far fetched. He’s in a coma, he’s not coming out of it. He was in double organ failure, his lungs had failed him, his bowels had failed him, but when he heard his children, he opened his eyes and the nurses were witness to that.”Mr Burke’s family returned home and awaited a call from the hospital to update them on his condition.However, the father of four who had no underlying medical condition survived the next 24 hours, and medics began to provide him with various medications in a bid to improve his bowels to the point where they could operate on him.“They said he had a 5 per cent chance of regenerating enough of the bowel to stabilise him enough for the operating theatre. And it did happen,” Ms Burke said.“On the following Wednesday, they decided right he’s lasted Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday - four days - and he didn’t deteriorate. He didn’t improve, but he didn’t deteriorate. That was shocking them.“They kept saying why is he not going into multi-organ failure”, why is he still with us? They couldn’t understand it. They said right, we’ve secured him enough, we’ve stabilised him enough. We were absolutely thrilled. We’re just so overjoyed with the outcome.”Mr Burke underwent surgery, made a full recovery and is now back at home with his family.Mr Burke said he “can’t imagine” what it was like for his family.“I don’t know how they did it. I personally think if I was in Joanne’s shoes, I would have caved,” he said. “I’m doing good. I’m in recovery mode.

Photograph: Phil Noble - WPA PoolGetty ImagesThe cost to the Garda of providing security during the recent visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to Ireland has been estimated at €1.3 million.A major security operation was required when Prince William and Kate Middleton visited the Republic last month for a trip of just over 48 hours.It involved armed gardaí from the Emergency Response Unit escorting the couple around with Royal protection officers from Britain. Snipers were also deployed on rooftops in some areas they visited for long periods.The high visibility policing operation, involving uniform frontline members, was also in place in the places they visited and on the routes between those locations. Significant road ersions were also in place while drains were combed for any explosive devices in advance of their visit. Many of the gardaí involved in the security operation were working overtime in order that regular policing could continue across the country. The cost of the security operation has been confirmed by Garda Commissioner Drew Harris in correspondence to the Policing Authority. Garda sources while it may take some time for all of the overtime and expense claims to be processed before a precise cost could be arrived at, the final bill would be €1.3 million or very close to that figure.Mr Harris told the Policing Authority the visit was a “significant pressure… specifically on the overtime and travel and subsistence budgets”.The cost of the visit, from March 3rd to 5th, compares to €300,000 for a visit to Ireland of about 36 hours by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in 2018.However, the cost to the Garda of the visit was modest compared to the €24 million security budget for the visit of Queen Elizabeth to Ireland in 2011.Last June when US president Donald Trump visited Ireland the security bill ran to €11 million while the visit by US vice president Mike Pence last September cost €3 million.The visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge saw the couple visit President Michael D Higgins at Áras an Uachtaráin as well as other parts of Dublin including the Garden of Remembrance, Government Buildings, the Guinness Store House, Temple Bar and Howth. They also visited the Teagasc Animal Bioscience Research Centre in Co Meath and met farmers in the county as well as the children’s and family charity Extern in Co Kildare. They concluded their visit in Galway, with a walkabout in the city, and were given a crash course in hurling at Salthill Knocknacarra GAA Club.Mr Harris also told the Policing Authority the policing operation around Covid19 would put the force under unprecedented financial pressure but said senior officers had been asked to stay within their budgets for this time of year. However, informed sources said the update to the authority was written before the full scale of the policing operation required for Covid19 was formulated and put in place and that budgets would be exceeded given the scale of the operation required.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4236448.1587672622!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"proposals for traffic calming measures on roads in north and west dublin outlined","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe proposals, which are subject to a public consultation, will affect people in Donabate, Swords, Rush, Castleknock (above), Blanchardstown, Ongar, Malahide, Sutton and Portmarnock.

The British government’s plan to deal with legacy issues from the Troubles, announced on March 18th, also promises to be a focus when normal life resumes, he said. Mr Mulvaney, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in March, had been scheduled to make his first visit to Northern Ireland as US special envoy next month. But the coronavirus has put that plan on hold. “I have been using the time to familiarise myself with the issues. Obviously, Covid-19 is the focus of everyone’s attention right now. It’s a very fluid situation,” he said, speaking from his home in South Carolina, the state he represented in Congress before joining the Trump administration. Like millions of people across the United States, the former White House chief of staff has been working from home where he is based with his wife and three children, as states have imposed stay-at-home restrictions. He says he will visit Northern Ireland “as soon as the door opens”.Interest in positionThe Irish-American politician has been communicating with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, and Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis in the past few weeks.He has also spoken to previous holders of the post, such as Richard Haass, chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, who was appointed by George W Bush. Mr Mulvaney (52), who reportedly had expressed a long-held interest in the position that had been vacant since the end of the Obama presidency, said his appointment was a measure of the Trump administration’s interest in Northern Ireland and Brexit in particular. He said Mr Trump views the post as akin to the role held by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who he appointed to manage the White House strategy on the Middle East. “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal – it’s a big deal just generally, and in terms of North-South relations – so he said to me: ‘Jared is going to go and take care of the Palestinians and Israelis, you make sure things go smoothly over there,” says Mr Mulvaney. The husband of Mr Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, is widely viewed to have had minimal success with bringing peace to the Middle East. Trump and PompeoMr Mulvaney visited Northern Ireland in February ahead of his appointment, where he met with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and the new permanent secretary at the Northern Ireland Office, Madeline Alessandri. He also met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and US ambassador Ed Crawford, a Trump appointee, at Farmleigh.The role of Northern Ireland envoy falls under the remit of the US state department, and Mr Mulvaney will report to Mr Trump and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Mr Mulvaney was replaced as Mr Trump’s chief of staff by congressman Mark Meadows last month. Like many in the administration, Mr Mulvaney played down the risk of coronavirus as recently as late February.Asked if he missed working at the White House, he replied: “I’m always happy to be home, but it’s kind of strange to be out of Washington at this time.” He says he still talks to the president and points out that Mr Meadows is a friend of his. Both were co-founders of the Freedom Caucus on Capitol Hill, a group of conservative, Republican lawmakers.

Photograph: CollinsThe Green Party has set out 17 demands that must be met before it would be amendable to consider coalition talks involving Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.The demands include a commitment to very ambitious annual reductions of 7 per cent in carbon emissions a fifth of all transport capital spending to be ringfenced for cycling and walking, as well as two-thirds of the overall transport budget to be targeted at public transport rather than private transport.In its comprehensive response to the joint framework document agreed between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael last week, the Green Party also calls for the ending of direct provision, the exploration of a universal basic income for everybody in society, as well as the halting of controversial fossil fuel infrastructure, including the planned liquid natural gas (LNG) plant earmarked for the Shannon Estuary area.The party has said that a ‘Green New Deal’ must be at the heart of any government that is formed in the 33rd Dáil.Party leader Eamon Ryan has said the challenging target of a seven per cent reduction in greenhouse emissions would effectively comprise a red line for the party.“If we were trying to go into government and we were not really ambitions in terms of climate change, I think it would be very hard for us to get it through our members, not alone that, but through our parliamentary party as well.”Mr Ryan, party chairman Roderic O’Gorman and Carlow-Kilkenny TD Malcolm Noonan expanded on the details of the document to the media on Thursday.Speaking outside Leinster House in Dublin, Mr Ryan emphasised it was not a government negotiation document but rather a clarification document specifically in response to the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael framework document.“We’ve a bit of time to start really thinking about what the next government is going to do, which is going to be charged with this economic recovery. That’s the big task. We think it can be green. We think Europe is looking in that direction for a European Green Deal,” he said.The document has stated a ‘Green New Deal’ recovery will provide just such a strategic approach.“It would allow us to build a new circular economy which is more secure and sustainable than the existing system. At the same time, it would allow us to forge a new social contract and address inequality for all our people,” it states.The party has posed its demands in the form of 17 questions to Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, which cumulatively - if accepted - will result in very radical and dramatic change in the way Irish economy and society are ordered.“Over the past 40 years the Green Party has campaigned to create a fairer society within a circular economy that protects the environment we all share. We believe that the next ten years are critical if we are to address the climate and bioersity crisis which threatens our safety, security and of the next Government,” the document states.The 17 demands are:1. A seven per cent reduction in carbon emissions each year.2. Massive development in renewable energy infrastructure including off-shore wind, solar power and an upgrade of national grid.3. An end to exploration licences for offshore gas exploration.4. Stopping the fossil fuel infrastructure, particularly the LNG import terminal currently being planned for the River Shannon.5. Exclusive provision of public housing, social housing and cost rental housing on public lands.6. Prioritise urban renewal in line with a ‘town centre first’ model.7. A deep retrofit programme as part of a programme for8. A new social contract.9. Ending the direct provision system and replace it with accommodation provided by approved housing bodies.10. Commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas development aid.11. Development of a national land use plan.12. At least 20 per cent of transport spending on cycling and walking, and two-thirds of remaining budget on public transport.13. Trial universal basic income (UBI) within the lifetime of the government.14. Revision of National Development Plan to meet new climate targets and social policy goals.15.Review of the Government and Oireachtas response to the Covid-19 crisis.16.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill They should be in the dock.Leo Varadkar. Micheál Martin. Mary Lou McDonald. Eamon Ryan. Mattie, Willie, Ringer, Róisín, Simon, Simon, Gino, the Healy-Raes, Richard Boyd Barrett, Violet-Anne Wynne, Heather, Hildegarde, Ó Snodaigh, O’Callaghan, Ó Fearghaíl...They should be in the dock. These desperate days, it’s the only place for the likes of them.Anyone watching what passed for Dáil proceedings would have reached the same verdict on Thursday. It’s a sad, pathetic little parliament now.Nobody’s fault. Blame the virus. But the sooner they ship out of the Dáil chamber and hightail it across the Liffey to the Convention Centre in Spencer Dock the better it will be for everyone. With or without a government, Dáil Éireann cannot carry on much longer with the pitiful sitting arrangements imposed on the House because of the Covid-19 restrictions.For social distancing reasons, there are yawning gaps between deputies. This is certainly not conducive to the cut and thrust. A few hours into the latest sitting, even the gaps were yawning.The size of the buffer zone between each TD has been increased since the last time they met. Now, alternate rows are roped off and lie empty while bright yellow prohibition notices adorn blocks of seats in the other rows. Large printed place-cards signpost the paltry amount of usable pews scattered around the chamber.“We have been battered by a wave of destruction but, as a people, we have endured,” quivered the Taoiseach to the hairy handful it washed in to hear him (the lack of hairdressing services is taking its toll on everyone).Apparently a small family of voles has moved into Eamon Ryan’s exploding bouffant, which has become a topic of waspish discussion among some men in Leinster House who are not so blessed in the roofing area.“Actually, it’s much more important to have your hair cut regularly when you’re thinning a bit,” confided a colleague as he cast sour glances down the Green leader’s bonce from the vantage point of the press gallery.The Greens, by the way, took to the plinth to announce their latest move in the slow bicycle race to government. The party released a letter it sent to the leaders of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael outlining its conditions for entering coalition.They included a list of 17 questions that they say must be answered if a deal is to be done.Arrowhead formationEamon Ryan was joined by fellow TDs Malcolm Noonan and Roderic O’Gorman. They stood at the microphones in an arrowhead formation, with Ryan at the front, looking like three remaining skittles waiting to be hit by a bowling ball.Back inside, discussion of the Covid-19 crisis continued. There were serious and worthwhile contributions, with the nursing and care home situation still one of the main concerns of deputies, alongside continuing questions over the issue of transparency and communications.The Sinn Féin leader told the Taoiseach she is worried about the “the mixed messages and kite-flying from your Government”. Mary Lou McDonald looked in fine fettle and she thanked everyone for their good wishes and expressions of concern during her recent encounter with the virus.Indeed, when she stood to speak, her words carried extra weight as she was speaking as a survivor. She turned to Leo Varadkar.“Taoiseach, I waited 16 days for a test result.”Some waited even longer, she said, many of them frontline workers. This is “unacceptable” and “scandalous” and needs to be fixed.Puffed upThe authorities in Leinster House worked very hard to get their distancing measurements right, but they miscalculated where Alan Kelly was concerned. The new leader of the Labour Party was so puffed up with contentment he took up an extra seat on either side. He is the happiest TD in Kildare Street at the moment and going about his new job with commendable vigour.The three double doors to the chamber are now flung open for the duration of Dáil sessions, all the better to waft the germs about in the cross-flow. Depending on who is speaking (dead heat between Mick Barry and Richard Boyd Barrett) you can hear them at the end of the corridor at the foot of the staircase.A large mahogany table has been put in place just outside the main doors into the chamber. There is a big bottle of sanitiser, a box of surgical gloves and a couple of boxes of tissues on it. It looks a bit seedy.Down in the belly of the beast, on the floor of the House, the Clerk of the Dáil now sits where the Oireachtas reporters usually sit. These are the men and women who are charged with committing the works of TDs to the official record, but only after they have corrected their grammar, reordered sentences, removed repetition, deadened regional lyricism and dulled rhetorical flourishes in accordance with ridiculously outdated rules taken from Westminster.The ushers were charged with making sure that the handful of members allowed in for the different sessions – first up was Leo Varadkar, followed by the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Education – sat in their designated seats.Varadkar’s name-card said “Taoiseach”. Micheál Martin sat behind “Fianna Fáil 1”. We can’t really remember what he said because we were still thinking of the conversation he had in the street the other day with Róisín Ingle about rhubarb.The sitting, which started at midday, was scheduled to finish at around seven, but the talking continued until the dot of eight so that the TDs present could join in the national round of applause and appreciation for frontline workers.The Taoiseach nipped in for the occasion, as did Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht Josepha Madigan, who stood out in an emerald green suit.Magician’s assistantIt was a sad day for Josepha, who had performed like a magician’s assistant at previous socially distanced sessions, sitting at a decent remove from the Taoiseach for most of the time until magically appearing in a seat directly behind him when he was on his feet and on camera.The strict new arrangements mean doughnuts are most definitely off the menu, so there will be no more “doughnutting” around the leader for exposure purposes.Enforcement of the rules made for a strange atmosphere. At times, the chamber resembled a restaurant with notions, with the uniformed Captain of the Guard sliding around the carpeted walkways like a maître d’ as he showed TDs to their reserved seats.You had to feel sorry for the Ceann Comhairle, who spent most of the day in the chair without hearing as much as a voice raised in anger, never mind a bellowing match across the floor. He looked very forlorn as he looked out across the silent benches.Nobody even wished Seán Ó Fearghaíl a happy birthday. We hear the popular Ceann Comhairle celebrated a big roundy one last Friday. Comhghairdeas, Seán.We hear preparations are now well in train to move the whole kit and caboodle over to the Convention Centre for when the time comes to elect a new government or hold votes on important legislation.The Dockside Dáil – depending on Covid-19 – it could be in operation for a long time to come."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Contribution comes days after Washington said the US would freeze funding to WHOHardline clerics calling the shots and urging devotees to ignore anti-pandemic measuresLatest cases raise concern about potential impact on Nagasaki residentsSouth Korea\u0026rsquos presidential Blue House says no unusual signs coming from neighbourLeatherbacks are world\u0026rsquos largest sea turtles and are endangered in ThailandFifteen activists arrested in biggest such crackdown since start of anti-government ralliesRevision after scepticism of official figures and claims in US virus may be sourced to labPresident\u0026rsquos ruling party projected to win election with highest turnout since 1992Health officials say 409 imported infections are Chinese citizens returning from RussiaWidespread reports that African nationals in Guangzhou are being targeted as potential \u0026lsquocarriers\u0026rsquoAmbassadors express concerns over claims of eviction and forced testingSouth Korean health officials said it remains unclear what is behind the trendMove is likely to be part of attempt to control the narrative surrounding the pandemicDelayed response to coronavirus outbreak had consequences for Chinese city and the worldChina\u0026rsquos appointment like making \u0026lsquopyromaniac the town fire chief\u0026rsquo, says watchdogVirus lockdown lifted on Wuhan but imposed on Suifenhe on Russian frontierSurge in new cases in city-state and Hong Kong leads to tough new restrictionsCleric (78) to be freed from jail after Australian court quashes child abuse convictionsAuthorities work to stave off second wave amid struggle with ongoing outbreaks in WuhanScientists say survey shows damage more widespread than any preceding eventsStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4236132.1587650360!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"imams overrule pakistan s coronavirus lockdown as ramadan begins","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            People attend evening prayers at a mosque in Karachi, Pakistan, on Sunday.

Photograph: Sohail ShahzadEPAWhile clerics and governments across the Muslim world will greet Ramadan this week under lockdown, working together to shut mosques and urging worshippers to pray at home, in Pakistan, some of the most prominent imams have rallied their devotees to ignore the anti-pandemic measures.Ramadan, which begins on Thursday night, is the holy month in which Muslims crowd into mosques and fast all day, holding feasts after sundown with family and friends. Those are ripe conditions for the coronavirus to spread, and imams around the world are asking people to stay home.But in Pakistan, pandemic or no pandemic, hardline clerics are calling the shots, overriding the government’s nationwide virus lockdown, which began late last month. Most clerics complied with the shutdown when it was announced. But some of the most influential ones immediately called on worshippers to attend Friday prayers in even greater numbers. Devotees attacked police officers who tried to get in their way.As Ramadan drew closer, dozens of well-known clerics and leaders of religious parties – including some who had initially obeyed the lockdown orders – signed a letter demanding that the government exempt mosques from the shutdown during the holy month or invite the anger of God and the faithful.On Saturday, the government gave in, signing an agreement that let mosques stay open for Ramadan as long as they followed 20 rules, including forcing congregants to maintain a six-foot distance, bring their own prayer mats and do their ablutions at home.By the time prime minister Imran Khan met with the clerics ln Monday, deferentially promising to abide by the deal, critics were demanding to know who was in charge during this national crisis: the government or the mosques. “The state has become totally subservient to these clerics,” said Husnul Amin, an Islamabad-based professor and scholar on Islam and politics. “It is very difficult for the state to implement what’s best for the public good. The larger public interest is always up against the clerics. It’s completely undemocratic.”JihadisPakistan’s imams were empowered by the military during the 1980s when mosques across the country churned out jihadis to fight the Soviet military in Afghanistan with the support of the United States. While other countries tried to curb hardline clerics’ influence after the Afghan war, recognising the dangers they posed, in Pakistan, the powerful military continued to use them as tools of foreign and domestic policy. But their defiance of the lockdown is exposing the limits of even the military’s control. The military wanted the shutdown, pressuring Khan to back the measure at a time when he was reluctant and worried about the economic toll. But when the security forces tried to prevent worshippers from gathering at mosques for prayers, they found themselves under attack.In Karachi, the largest city, scenes emerged of worshippers chasing the police through narrow alleyways, pelting them with rocks and sending several officers to the hospital. “The military has created a monster they can no longer control,” Amin said. “They are the creation of the military, and only they could handle them. That may no longer be the case.” By the time Ramadan approached, police officers were no longer willing to erect cordons around mosques to stop gatherings for prayers. While clerics acknowledge that their mosques are perfect vectors for the coronavirus’s spread – worshippers gather to perform ablutions together before cramming into the mosques, shoulder to shoulder in supplication – they say they have to protect their bottom line: money and influence.“We know the coronavirus pandemic is a global health issue, but religious duties cannot be abandoned,” said Maulana Ataullah Hazravi, a Karachi-based cleric. And, he added, “mosques depend largely on the donations collected during Ramadan.” That point – money – was high on the list of grievances that the clerics raised in their letter last week. Worshippers open their wallets wide during Ramadan, donating millions of dollars. And in places like Pakistan, where mosques are not under the authority of the state, the money can make or break imams and the followings they try to build, often to parlay into political power to challenge the government.State’s authorityPakistani clerics have frequently used their religious authority to get loyalists to lay siege to the capital, for example, forcing the state to change policies they disagree with. That differs from countries such as Egypt or the United Arab Emirates, where the authorities give clerics guidelines or even specific remarks for their Friday sermons. “Clerics don’t want to lose their social and political control over society. They fear that if Muslims don’t come to the mosques, they will lose their power, their influence,” Amin said. The clerics, observers said, may worry that if the government forces their mosques to close during Ramadan – using the pandemic, from their point of view, as a cover – it could provide an opening to finally bring them under the state’s authority.An editorial in the prominent newspaper Dawn demanded that the clerical establishment take a back seat and let the government manage the crisis. “This should not be seen as an affront to religion,” editors wrote last week. “Rather, it is an attempt to save the lives of the general public.” But in private meetings with officials, clerics warned that the state would invite “God’s wrath” if it restricted prayers during Ramadan, Hazravi said – code for the political chaos that imams have unleashed in the past. While the government has given in this time, healthcare workers have not. Prominent doctors signed their own open letter Tuesday, urging that mosques be ordered to limit attendance to five worshippers at a time. On Wednesday, they doubled down on their warnings at a news conference.By Wednesday evening, the virus had infected at least 10,100 in Pakistan and killed some 210 people, according to officials. Experts say that the true numbers are probably much higher and that the government is not testing enough. The country’s bare-bones medical system, stretched during ordinary times to fight preventable diseases such as polio and dengue, is overwhelmed. Doctors and nurses have threatened to walk off the job unless given basic protective gear, such as masks and gloves. Several have fallen ill with the virus and died.“With Ramadan approaching,” the letter from the doctors read, “we fear that allowing large congregations in mosques will increase the likelihood of infection.” But some of the faithful say they do not care about the science. “Muslims wait for this month for the whole year so that they can earn maximum rewards from God by fasting and offering our prayers,” said Hazrat Ali, a worshipper in Karachi, where many mosques defied the lockdown from the start. “If the government stops us forcibly from visiting the mosques, we will resist,” he said. – New York TimesStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4236354.1587663891!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"netherlands abandons initial plan to develop covid 19 tracing app","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDutch prime minister Mark Rutte (right) and Dutch health minister Hugo de Jonge. Mr de Jonge said he would make no concessions on protecting user privacy in the app. Photograph: Bart MaatANPAFP via Getty ImagesThe Dutch government has abandoned its initial attempt to commission a Covid-19 contact tracing app after the final seven designs were dismissed as inadequate on privacy grounds.The mobile app was planned as part of the Netherlands’ exit strategy from coronavirus lockdown. With primary schools to re-open from May 11th, health minister Hugo de Jonge pledged on Thursday to appoint a new team immediately to oversee the development of the app, and said he would make no concessions on protecting privacy.The latest statistics show 4,177 registered deaths in the Netherlands as a result of the virus, though taking nursing homes into account could see that figure almost double. Even so, both hospital admissions and fatalities are showing a steady decrease, according to the public health institute.Both Mr de Jonge and prime minister Mark Rutte have said they aim to use two complementary apps that together would play a key role in identifying remaining coronavirus hotspots and allowing targeted interventions when the lockdown eventually eases.The more basic of those apps – developed by Amsterdam hospital OLVG– is already available and allows users to enter medical data and personal observations that will prompt a call from a doctor if they appear worrying.The second app – which is proving more contentious to develop – would establish Bluetooth connections to other phones. Where any user of the app became infected, it would then be possible to trace anyone who had been in the user’s vicinity to carry out testing and manage the outbreak.Both China and South Korea successfully used smartphone apps to monitor patients with the disease and to track their contacts, but in the West concerns about privacy and data collection by governments are highly sensitive politically.Privacy concernsJust a week ago, nine IT experts who had been part of the government’s assessment panel for the initial 63 proposed apps signed an open letter saying they were withdrawing because the criteria were unclear, the process was flawed, and user anonymity was not necessarily assured.Having seen the process from the inside, they came out in support of 140 academics who warned recently that deploying the apps without proper safeguards or acknowledgment of new European Commission guidelines risked setting a precedent for post-coronavirus usage.In the case of one app, its source code allegedly included links to the personal details of 200 users of another app.The government’s problems became even more acute last weekend when attorney general Reimer Veldhuis was asked to assess the final seven contenders for compliance with privacy laws – and found all seven lacking.The government says it is hoping the final apps will be used voluntarily, but has not ruled out making them compulsory if necessary to ensure the required 60 per cent penetration.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: Essential workers and their families can order tests online from Friday, Matt Hancock saysOnly 30 of 4,000 prisoners released early as jails step up to combat spread of coronavirusContact tracing: how has it worked for other countries, and could it really help ease UK lockdown?National Crime Agency investigates child abuse images on ZoomAm I an essential worker?

They put together a timeline and network of contact, telling other people who might have been exposed to quarantine themselves.The Health Secretary has revealed that infrastructure is being put in place so that contact tracing can be rolled out on a large scale. A new NHS contact tracing app is currently undergoing testing, with 18,000 people, including 3,000 clinicians, being hired to work on it.Anyone who becomes unwell with coronavirus symptoms will be able to inform the NHS through the app, which would then inform other users with whom they had significant contact.In Europe, governments want to use Bluetooth \u0027handshakes\u0027 between devices as a way to measure the risk of infection, but approaches differ as to whether such contacts should be logged on devices or on a central server.Under Germany\u0027s contact tracing policy, every person who has come into contact with an infected patient in the last two weeks is tracked down and tested.Although the number of national tracers is unknown, in one region, near the Dutch border, officials rang those isolating twice a day to check their symptoms and their temperatures, according to the Rheinische Post, a local newspaper.Germany has also chosen a home-grown smartphone app, developed for the Robert Koch Institute, to trace infections.The government told lawmakers it has backed the centralised platform developed by the Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT) consortium and an app built by one of its members, the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute.The move puts it at odds with Apple, which has refused on privacy grounds to support the necessary short-range communication on iPhones.Irish public servants are making more than 2,000 calls a day to monitor and trace the spread of the coronavirus.The contacts of every confirmed case in the country have been contacted, officials have said, and before lockdown this involved calling around 40 people per person.Earlier this month, officials said 2,000 calls were being made a day from nine tracing centres across the country - this is set to be increased to 5,000 calls per day.The team comprises 200 tracers, but 1,700 have received training in how to make the calls and could be utilised if the outbreak continues, The  reports.Tracers include Defence Force Cadets and more than 60,000 personal contacts have been made so far.Belgium will hire 2,000 “corona detectives” to trace the contacts of iniduals with Covid-19.The team of tracers will be distributed regionally, with 200 in Brussels, 600 in Wallonia and 1,200 in Flanders, according to the national newspaper, De Tijd.Those identified by the contact tracers will then be tested, if they test positive for Covid-19 they will be quarantined for two weeks.Federal authorities are also working on developing an app to locate potential coronavirus infections. A legal framework is being designed for the app and regional authorities would choose which developer they wish to work with.The United States currently has 2,200 disease investigation specialists, known as contact tracers, according to a report by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO).But it would need at least an additional 100,000 to trace possible infections, ASTHO estimated.Contact tracing is currently being conducted at a state level, despite Robert Redfield, head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, stating “it is going to be critical”.Mike Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, will help build an army of coronavirus tracers to test, trace and then isolate residents with the virus in the tri-state area New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. New York state currently has 500 tracers.San Francisco has also launched a pilot program linking a tech company with 250 tracers, while Massachusetts has said it will hire around 1,000.In France mobile teams will be used to trace the contacts of those infected with the coronavirus, French health authorities have said.But they did not specify how many contact tracers the country currently has.France aims to be able to test 700,000 people per week for the virus and begin lifting restrictions on May 11.People infected with the virus will be put into quarantine at home or in specific facilities like hotels.Later this month, lawmakers will vote on the government’s plan to launch a contact tracing app to fight the coronavirus outbreak. The planned smartphone app would warn users if they come into contact with anyone infected with the coronavirus.In South Korea, where daily new case totals have mostly been lower than the previous day since the end of February, authorities have rigorously traced an inidual\u0027s movements after testing positive.They have done this through interviews, GPS phone tracking, credit-card records, and surveillance camera footage.Once potential virus carriers are identified they are also tested.Anonymised data showing Covid-19 patient\u0027s movements is also published online, allowing others to identify if they may have come into contact with an infected inidual.The effective contact tracing system, known as the Covid-19 Smart Management System, is run by the country’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) and can analyse a person’s movements in just 10 minutes.In Singapore, the government has said that it is able to trace between 2,000 and 4,000 contacts of Covid-19 patients each day, as members of the police and army phone people who may have come into contact with a confirmed case.The country also launched the app TraceTogether on March 20 to track the contacts of those who have been infected with the coronavirus.It claims to have around 1.1 million users, around one fifth of the country’s population, and uses Bluetooth technology.The app logs unique codes over Bluetooth signals between nearby phones which have the app installed, the data is then used to identify contacts when one user tests positive for the virus.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"russians file countrys first class action suit against coronavirus","story":"More than 20 residents of St. Petersburg, Russia\u0027s second-largest city, filed the country\u0027s first class action suit against coronavirus lockdown measures on Thursday, arguing that the government should take on responsibility for the financial losses of private businesses.Russia declared a state of high alert in mid-March, but stopped short of declaring a state of emergency that would not only allow the authorities to restrict people\u0027s movements and shut down businesses, but would also oblige compensation to be paid to the affected iniduals.The lawsuit against a local lockdown decree, filed in St. Petersburg on Thursday, does not aim to lift the restrictions but to get the government to follow the law, Maxim Olenichev, of the lawyers\u0027 association Team 29, which represents the claimants, said in a statement.The government refuses to announce an emergency situation and the president refuses to declare a state of emergency because in that case the state would have to take on the commitment to cover for the losses incurred, he said.Russia entered the coronavirus crisis with solid public finances and about £400 billion in reserves, but the Kremlin has been reluctant to throw money at businesses as oil prices, the backbone of the country\u0027s economy, tanked.In recent weeks, the Kremlin and regional governments have raised unemployment benefits and offered tax breaks and interest-free loans to businesses – but for an overwhelming number of small businesses and the self-employed, that was not much help.Meanwhile, the outbreak of Covid-19 in Russia seems to be plateauing. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases went up by 4,774 on Wednesday in the lowest one-day jump since Monday. In the past 24 hours, Moscow added fewer than 2,000 cases for the first time in a week.The Russian capital last week rolled out digital permits, obliging anyone who wants to use public transport or drive to apply for a pass via a City Hall website or a text message.After reports that the number of people in the street has dropped by half a million since the permits were introduced, federal authorities announced that digital permits will be rolled out in a quarter of Russian regions by next week.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/20/14/20317448-high-res-the-big-night-in-with-children-in-need-and-comic-relief.jpg","title":"bbc big night in live stream channel best bits peter kay little britain catch up watch","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Lenny Henry, Catherine Tate and many more famous faces star in the fundraiserFollowing the success of Lady Gaga\u0027s\u0026nbspOne World: Together at Home concert, the BBC has its own offering to keep us sane during these strange days in lockdown: The Big Night In.The charity event\u0026nbspwill see Comic Relief and Children in Need team up for a night of live entertainment,\u0026nbspstarring many famous faces from Lenny Henry to Catherine Tate.Matt Lucas and David Walliams will be bringing Little Britain back to the screen for the first time in ten years, and Dawn French is making a one-off comeback as the Vicar Of Dibley,Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPeter Kay will also unveil the new version of his “(Is This The Way To) Amarillo” music video, 15 years after the original hit.And there\u0027ll be chances to win “money can’t buy prizes”, live music performances and “big surprises”.\u0026nbsp​Follow along with the action in our live blog, below...Matt Lucas and David Walliams performed a medley of their Little Britain sketches for the first time in 10 years.

Larger firms have received £11.2bn through a credit facility with the Bank of England while 500,000 SMEs have had grants totalling £6bn, Mr Sharma said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHe added: “I think you have to look at the totality of what we are offering ...\u0026nbspif you look at what the Swiss are offering in terms of fiscal stimulus, as I understand the majority of it has gone through these particular loan schemes.”Mr Sharma conceded that there was a need to “get more loans out there” but said that the number of accredited lenders had increased to 48 with the addition of peer-to-peer platforms like Funding Circle.Businesses demand more help from banks during Covid-19 pandemicFigures released on Thursday by banking trade body UK Finance show that 16,624 of the 36,186 small business finance applications for CBILS facility have been processed and approved. The average value of a CBILS loan stands at £171,000. Business groups say that is not enough and are calling for urgent changes to the scheme.Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: “It is positive to see the scheme ramping up, but cash still needs to get to more businesses quickly. Reforms have started to bed in, and more money is getting out the door. However, there are still swathes of businesses facing processing delays and restrictive viability criteria, and many are reluctant to engage with the system at all.”He urged the government to relax affordability criteria for small loans and to increase state backing for lenders’ losses.Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) chair\u0026nbspMike Cherry called on banks to consider firms at the heart of communities such as small shops, restaurants, gyms, manufacturers and mechanics, many of whom are looking for relatively small loans.“These figures mark an improvement,” Mr Cherry said. “But we need to see far more from the banks where the speed of processing applications and making money available to the smallest businesses are concerned.“The government should up its guarantee on emergency loans with values under £30,000 from 80 per cent to 100 per cent. That, combined with the streamlined application process that should be in place for facilities of this size, should help to get more cash to the small firms that really need it.”Part of the problem is that while the government is backing up to 80 per cent of banks’ losses on the loans, that still leaves them on the hook for 20 per cent. Given the potential size of the scheme, that represents a risk that some lenders appear reluctant to take.Banks may also need to change some of their operations to allow them to approve commercial loans under £25,000 because of consumer credit rules.Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey suggested last week that the government should look at guaranteeing business loans under £25,000 so that banks can avoid carrying out standard credit checks that have blocked some applications.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastTreasury officials are understood to be concerned about potential abuse of the system if guarantees are increased to 100 per cent. But those fears must be weighed against the danger of exacerbating economic damage caused by the pandemic if thousands of businesses run out of cash and go bust.Mr Sharma also said he would look to introduce measures to ease commercial rent demand within the next week.“I do think the majority of landlords and tenants are working well, they are reaching agreements on debt obligations but I am certainly aware that certain landlords are putting undue financial pressure with aggressive debt recovery tactics,” he said.“What I’m very happy to say to you is I will look to introduce temporary measures on this particular issue which will ease commercial rent demand and protect the UK high street ... that is something I will be doing very very shortly.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There is no suggestion that Mr Christodolou knew about the contents of the letter.Last month, the government suspended all eviction proceedings for 90 days as part of emergency measures to protect renters, but campaigners argue further action is needed.Under the temporary rules, tenants can also ask their landlord for a rent repayment holiday if they are struggling to pay, although they will have to make up the arrears after the period of national emergency is over.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The current crisis has brought these issues into stark relief.“With millions of low-paid renters in London now facing increased financial uncertainty we face a ticking timebomb of debt, arrears and widespread evictions once the suspension in court proceedings is lifted.”Landlords welcomed the proposal to increase public funding to cover tenants’ rent payments.\u0026nbspBen Beadle, chief executive of the National Residential Landlords Association, said the group supported an increase in the housing allowance.Future of UK shopping centres in doubt as retailers stop paying rentHe added: “In addition, we repeat our call on the Government to scrap the five-week wait for the first payment of Universal Credit immediately and ensure tenants can have the housing element of the credit paid directly to their landlord if they wish.”Private landlords received £23bn of public money through housing benefit payments last year, money that critics argue would be better spent on ending a chronic undersupply of social and affordable housing.The Money Advice Trust, a charity that runs the National Debtline, is calling for holidays for council tax bills, which, along with rent, are among the most common reasons for people to fall into debt.“People struggling with council tax bills, self-employed people facing immediate hardship, and private renters are particularly at risk of falling into serious financial difficulty,” said Joanna Elson, the charity’s chief executive.“The government must take urgent action to close the gaps in its Covid-19 financial support package, or many more households will fall into problem debt.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Larger firms have received £11.2bn through a credit facility with the Bank of England while 500,000 SMEs have had grants totalling £6bn, Mr Sharma said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHe added: “I think you have to look at the totality of what we are offering ...\u0026nbspif you look at what the Swiss are offering in terms of fiscal stimulus, as I understand the majority of it has gone through these particular loan schemes.”Mr Sharma conceded that there was a need to “get more loans out there” but said that the number of accredited lenders had increased to 48 with the addition of peer-to-peer platforms like Funding Circle.Businesses demand more help from banks during Covid-19 pandemicFigures released on Thursday by banking trade body UK Finance show that 16,624 of the 36,186 small business finance applications for CBILS facility have been processed and approved. The average value of a CBILS loan stands at £171,000. Business groups say that is not enough and are calling for urgent changes to the scheme.Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: “It is positive to see the scheme ramping up, but cash still needs to get to more businesses quickly. Reforms have started to bed in, and more money is getting out the door. However, there are still swathes of businesses facing processing delays and restrictive viability criteria, and many are reluctant to engage with the system at all.”He urged the government to relax affordability criteria for small loans and to increase state backing for lenders’ losses.Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) chair\u0026nbspMike Cherry called on banks to consider firms at the heart of communities such as small shops, restaurants, gyms, manufacturers and mechanics, many of whom are looking for relatively small loans.“These figures mark an improvement,” Mr Cherry said. “But we need to see far more from the banks where the speed of processing applications and making money available to the smallest businesses are concerned.“The government should up its guarantee on emergency loans with values under £30,000 from 80 per cent to 100 per cent. That, combined with the streamlined application process that should be in place for facilities of this size, should help to get more cash to the small firms that really need it.”Part of the problem is that while the government is backing up to 80 per cent of banks’ losses on the loans, that still leaves them on the hook for 20 per cent. Given the potential size of the scheme, that represents a risk that some lenders appear reluctant to take.Banks may also need to change some of their operations to allow them to approve commercial loans under £25,000 because of consumer credit rules.Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey suggested last week that the government should look at guaranteeing business loans under £25,000 so that banks can avoid carrying out standard credit checks that have blocked some applications.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastTreasury officials are understood to be concerned about potential abuse of the system if guarantees are increased to 100 per cent. But those fears must be weighed against the danger of exacerbating economic damage caused by the pandemic if thousands of businesses run out of cash and go bust.Mr Sharma also said he would look to introduce measures to ease commercial rent demand within the next week.“I do think the majority of landlords and tenants are working well, they are reaching agreements on debt obligations but I am certainly aware that certain landlords are putting undue financial pressure with aggressive debt recovery tactics,” he said.“What I’m very happy to say to you is I will look to introduce temporary measures on this particular issue which will ease commercial rent demand and protect the UK high street ... that is something I will be doing very very shortly.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

All three companies say that they have used the period of closure to assess how to properly implement social distancing guidelines, but how will they ensure they keep staff and customers safe?Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDIY retailer B\u0026ampQ is reopening 61 of its 155 of its stores after closing them when the government announced the lockdown last month. The company is allowed to open as it’s designated as an essential business.Services like paint mixing, timber cutting and key cutting have been suspended. Customers will not be able to pay with cash and are advised to use contactless card payments where possible.Created with Sketch.How coronavirus lockdowns changed the world\u0027s most polluted cities Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Checkouts have been fitted with Perspex screens and 2m markers placed on the floor.A spokesperson said: “Similar to shopping at a supermarket, we’re strictly limiting the number of customers in store at any one time, and so customers are typically queueing before entering stores.“All stores have a designated queueing area outside and these have two metre markers to help remind everyone to respect each other’s personal space.Aston Martin Lagonda announced that it will resume operations at its St Athan facility, in Wales, on 5 May as it starts to gradually bring back the 75 per cent of its workforce currently furloughed.The luxury car maker says it is following guidelines from Public Health Wales and Public Health England to protect its workforce and will take “learnings in terms of health and safety” into account when it reopens its main car plant in Gaydon, Warwickshire, at a later date.Both sites have been closed since 25 March\u0026nbspdue to the coronavirus pandemic.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Staff will have their temperature checked when they arrive for signs of fever and must wear masks at work. They will be provided with all necessary personal protective equipment (PPE), and 2m\u0026nbspspacing will be marked on the floor, the company said.The firm also announced that its senior leadership team have agreed to a reduction in pay.For construction firms like Taylor Wimpey the challenges of working during a pandemic are different but no easier to deal with.There has been no government ban on construction work but the housebuilder closed its sites, show homes and sales centres last month, as a precaution. There had been a number of reports of other construction companies not operating proper social distancing measures.Taylor Wimpey plans to re-start building on 4 May after “meticulously” planning how to modify working practices to enable workers to return to safely to sites.Taylor Wimpy said it had created\u0026nbsp“detailed new site operating protocols developed in compliance with strict social distancing requirements”.The company said it had assessed each and every aspect of site activities to comply with guidance issued by the Construction Leadership Council (CLC).All employees, subcontractors and visitors will have to sign up to a new code of conduct. Workers will also be issued with bespoke PPE which the company has designed in house for jobs that require two people to work together.The Health and Safety Executive, a government body, will monitor safe processes on-site.Sales centres, show homes and regional offices remain closed with employees working remotely while Taylor Wimpey monitors the latest guidance.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Their unusual formation has been described by astronomers as a string of bright pearls and are clearly visible when they are angled in such a way that they reflect light from the Sun.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis could potentially cause disruption for optical telescopes and may even block sightings of Earth-bound asteroids, according to some astronomers.We\u0027re fixing it now, Mr Musk tweeted following the latest launch. We are taking some key steps to reduce satellite brightness... Should be much less noticeable during orbit raise by changing solar panel angle and all satellites get sunshades starting with launch nine.To hide the satellites from ground-based observers,\u0026nbspSpaceX\u0026nbspwill paint the base of the satellites black. The company is also working with the US National Radio Astronomy Observatory and the European radio astronomy community in order to mitigate any impact on radio astronomy activities.The\u0026nbspStarlink\u0026nbspinternet\u0026nbsphas already been tested by Mr Musk, who posted a tweet through it in November, but before it is made public later this year he\u0026nbspinvited people to attempt to hack the network.SpaceX\u0026nbsppreviously played down the risk of interference in astronomical observations posed by the Starlink satellites. Speaking at the Satellite 2020 conference in March, Mr Musk said that such concerns were being exaggerated.I am confident that we will not cause any impact whatsoever in astronomical discoveries, zero. That\u0027s my prediction, he said. We will take corrective action if it\u0027s above zero. I\u0027ve not met someone who can tell me where all of them are, so it can\u0027t be that big of a deal.Created with Sketch.Space as seen from a grandmother\u0027s garden Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Captured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean Dean, this picture was named picture of the day by NASACaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean Dean310 Horse Head and Flame NebulaeCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean Dean810 Bodes and Cigar GalaxiesCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanJean Dean with her Sky-Watcher ESPRIT 80ED telescopic cameraJean Dean at homeCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean Dean, this picture was named picture of the day by NASACaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean Dean310 Horse Head and Flame NebulaeCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean Dean810 Bodes and Cigar GalaxiesCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanJean Dean with her Sky-Watcher ESPRIT 80ED telescopic cameraJean Dean at homeFollowing a launch of Starlink satellites last year, astronomers at\u0026nbspthe Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in Chile reported disturbances with their observations.As the constellation of\u0026nbspStarlink\u0026nbspsatellites grows, and as more companies look to develop their own space-based\u0026nbspinternet\u0026nbspprojects, astronomers fear that the problem will not go away.An online petition calling for an end to the irresponsible practice of littering the night sky with bright low-orbit satellites has gathered more than 1,500 signatures.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After the government was heavily criticised for its failure to provide equipment to medical staff, Sarah says she\u0027s never had to enter a Covid-19 ward without PPE, but has “probably worn about five to six different types of gowns and visors and masks, depending on the stock and the flow and the amount of different stuff available at different sites.”You can read about the interview here.You can subscribe to the series on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Acast or wherever you listen.

We\u0027ll continue to work on features that make it easier to support the small businesses you care about.Instagram\u0027s update comes after another Facebook-owned platform, WhatsApp, released a new set of stickers designed to help people communicate about aspects of the pandemic.The stickers, developed in partnership with the World Health Organisation, were created to help users more accurately communicate the thoughts and feelings of being in lockdown.Tech giants such as Facebook have come under scrutiny during the pandemic, predominately for their response to the spread of disinformation linked to the virus.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

But a new study suggests that such visitors might have been alongside us all along.The researchers suggest that the objects came from other stars, billions of years ago, and have been orbiting around our Sun undiscovered ever since.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe objects were first pulled out of another\u0026nbspsolar system in the relatively early days of the universe, when the stars were closer together and so upset each other\u0027s gravity more easily.\u0026nbspThis enabled asteroids to be pulled from one star system to another, said Fathi Namouni, lead author of the study, in a statement.Just as with those other visitors, researchers hope they can use the objects to understand the differences between objects that have spent all of their time in our solar system and\u0026nbspthose alien visitors.“The discovery of a whole population of asteroids of interstellar origin is an important step in understanding the physical and chemical similarities and differences between solar system-born and interstellar asteroids,” commented Dr.\u0026nbspMorais.The researchers came upon the discovery after running computer simulations that allowed them to look at how the solar system may have looked in its earliest days. When they looked the asteroids in question, they found they were orbiting the Sun in a distant region beyond the disc of gas and dust that would form the rest of the asteroids, and along a different orbit to the other planets and asteroids.That strange placement led the researchers to speculate that the asteroids were not native at all but had actually been plucked out of interstellar space as the planets were forming.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Chips? More chips? What would you like to eat?” Lou asks.\u0026nbsp“Bat,” replies the monosyllabic Andy.“You wanna eat a bat for your tea?” Lou replies. “I don’t think it’s a good idea eating a bat.”Follow along live with the BBC’s Big Night InAndy then uttered his best-known catchphrase: “Yeah, I know.”A popular internet conspiracy theory claims that the coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China, after members of the public began eating bats. While the Wuhan Institute for Virology found that the genetic makeup of coronavirus was 96 per cent identical to the kind found in bats, it has not been officially proven to have stemmed from humans ingesting bats.The search for the origin to the pandemic is ongoing, though a study published this month suggested that coronavirus could have been spread by stray dogs eating bat meat.On Twitter, viewers were split on the gag.“Watching the Little Britain comeback sketch to see if they can rectify how problematic they were and the first joke was about eating a bat,” tweeted one audience member.Another added: “Little Britain have some balls making bat eating jokes.”One person praised the gag for “pushing boundaries”.“I wasn’t sure if Little Britain would work due to the current snowflake generation, wasn’t sure if they would be able to push boundaries,” the fan wrote. “First scene is Andy asking to eat bat. Thank you @RealMattLucas @davidwalliams”The return of Little Britain was one of a number of comedy sketches during the BBC’s Big Night In.Others included a special message from The Vicar of Dibley’s Reverend Geraldine Granger, and Peter Kay’s return to television after a two-year absence.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There is no suggestion that Mr Christodolou knew about the contents of the letter.Last month, the government suspended all eviction proceedings for 90 days as part of emergency measures to protect renters, but campaigners argue further action is needed.Under the temporary rules, tenants can also ask their landlord for a rent repayment holiday if they are struggling to pay, although they will have to make up the arrears after the period of national emergency is over.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The current crisis has brought these issues into stark relief.“With millions of low-paid renters in London now facing increased financial uncertainty we face a ticking timebomb of debt, arrears and widespread evictions once the suspension in court proceedings is lifted.”Landlords welcomed the proposal to increase public funding to cover tenants’ rent payments.\u0026nbspBen Beadle, chief executive of the National Residential Landlords Association, said the group supported an increase in the housing allowance.Future of UK shopping centres in doubt as retailers stop paying rentHe added: “In addition, we repeat our call on the Government to scrap the five-week wait for the first payment of Universal Credit immediately and ensure tenants can have the housing element of the credit paid directly to their landlord if they wish.”Private landlords received £23bn of public money through housing benefit payments last year, money that critics argue would be better spent on ending a chronic undersupply of social and affordable housing.The Money Advice Trust, a charity that runs the National Debtline, is calling for holidays for council tax bills, which, along with rent, are among the most common reasons for people to fall into debt.“People struggling with council tax bills, self-employed people facing immediate hardship, and private renters are particularly at risk of falling into serious financial difficulty,” said Joanna Elson, the charity’s chief executive.“The government must take urgent action to close the gaps in its Covid-19 financial support package, or many more households will fall into problem debt.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Her staff identified 420 iniduals and families in the London borough in dire need of food each day, and asked for volunteers to help drop off the vegan meals between 2pm and 6pm every afternoon.Kitchen staff at the Angelina restaurant in Dalston have helped with the cooking so they can meet a target of delivering 30,000 meals over the next three months.“We knew there was going to be this incredible level of need out there, so we ripped up our job descriptions and threw ourselves into this work,” says Ms Bentley. “It’s been pretty emotional at times, pretty intense to see what people are going through. We want to be able to help more people if we possibly can.”She told The Independent how one family had no food at all in the house for more than two days before they began getting daily meals out to them.One of those receiving a delivery each afternoon is David Pavlovic, a 63-year-old with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart disease, who was told not to leave home for a 12-week period.“I’ve got family outside of London and friends across the city – but they have problems of their own with job losses,” he says.“I did get worried for a while about having enough food, so it was just a massive relief to get meals delivered. The charities like The Felix Project and Made in Hackney are doing really important work, and it seems like they enjoy doing it too.

He picked up a van at a depot in northwest London, drove more than 100 miles to pick up two tons of surplus food, returned to the depot to unload, and then headed back out across the capital to deliver fresh produce to hungry children and adults. He works a 65-hour week –\u0026nbspand has done so since the start of the coronavirus outbreak –\u0026nbspfor no pay.MacNichol is a volunteer for The Felix Project, our Help The Hungry appeal partner. Since lockdown, Felix has quadrupled food deliveries to vulnerable Londoners to a staggering 100,000 meals a day. But they have had to manage this with a small staff of 22 and a 30-fold reduction in volunteers – from 3,500 to just 115 – as many of their volunteers are over 70 and can no longer work due to Covid-19 restrictions.These super volunteers are the backbone for London’s fourth emergency service –\u0026nbspfood provision to the capital’s hungry –\u0026nbspand Felix could not function without them. Today we meet six of them and ask why they joined and what volunteering means to them.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHow to support our campaign“Going back 10 years, we were instructed by our bosses at Sainsbury’s to destroy all surplus food, but then the likes of Felix came along and suddenly there was no excuse for waste. I was so impressed by Felix’s operation that I promised to volunteer when I retired. Since coronavirus, I do a 65-hour week. I start at their Park Royal depot, drive to Hello Fresh in Banbury and to Mindful Chef near Birmingham, returning with a two-ton\u0026nbsppayload. Later I deliver to community hubs, charities and schools that have set up food drop centres.“Recently I supplied a school in Ealing and as I arrived one boy said to his friend, “now we’ve got something to eat tonight”, and I thought, bloody hell. To think some parents have to choose between paying rent and feeding their children and that Felix is the only reason they can do both — it brings a lump to your throat.”Retired facilities manager for City officesRuns a fundraising\u0026nbspconsultancy for charities“I came across Felix when it launched in 2016 and was hired to help them raise funds. I promised myself that one day I would go back and volunteer –\u0026nbspand that’s what I did last November. It was amazing to see how Felix had grown into a major lifeline for thousands of Londoners. I thought, incredible growth, incredible impact –\u0026nbspit really does walk the talk. In my job, I see the distress inequality causes, but when I go out in a Felix van, I feel I am doing something good for the community. It might sound schmaltzy but, for me, it’s my war effort.”Economics graduate, works for Cisco Systems“I started volunteering for Felix in January and the thing that struck me when I first walked into their Park Royal warehouse was the unbelievable quantity of food that would otherwise go to waste. It is such a bustling place and since coronavirus, it’s even busier because major suppliers like Hello Fresh and Sainsbury’s have even more surplus food. It’s a boost for my morale to help during lockdown and satisfying to see the smiles on people’s faces as you arrive in the green Felix van.”Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastLawyer and non-executive director of Investec Wealth“I joined Felix last year because my friend Gary had been there 18 months and loves it, so I went out in the van and got hooked. I started doing one day a week but since coronavirus, I have been doing two full days as a co-driver. It’s hard physical work but it never fails to put a smile on my face. Since lockdown, my partner Rob drives me and today we were on the road for four hours delivering 16 crates of food to six charities and each time we were made to feel like Father Christmas.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A number of our churches across the capital, particularly those that host and run food banks and homeless shelters, have successfully partnered with Felix in the past. Never has there been a greater need for us all to come together to support the vulnerable in our local communities.”Imam Mahmoud, who ran a half marathon to support Felix in 2017, said: “I applaud the good work that The Independent and The Felix Project are doing to feed and support the elderly and most vulnerable members of our community during this time of crisis. In difficult times, it is important that we all come together regardless of background and support each other as a community and as a nation, the best we can.”With the start of Ramadan today, Imam Mahmoud added that he was particularly “moved by the good spirit” that people have shown towards others of late. “This project is close to my heart because I’ve seen first-hand the benefit that it has bought to the community. I urge everyone to continue to support Food for London Now and other projects like it.”Rabbi Mirvis called for a sense of community at a time when many feel isolated. He said: “The great Jewish sages taught that ‘anyone who saves a single life is considered to have saved the whole world’. In these extraordinary times, it is not only the heroes of the NHS who are called upon to fulfil this noblest aspiration. The efforts of The Independent and The Felix Project, together with their partners, make it possible for us all to play our part in saving the lives of the most vulnerable among us.“Today, as many thousands of people face the agonising uncertainty of not knowing where their next meal is coming from, we must reach out to them with compassion and reassurance. I urge everyone who is able to support the appeal.”How to support our campaignThe Independent\u0027s appeal, in association with our sister newspaper The Evening Standard, was set up to fund The Felix Project, London’s biggest surplus food distributor, to provide for the delivery of food to the poor and elderly who are unable to afford supplies, or are stuck at home at risk of losing their lives. Felix currently delivers the equivalent of 100,000 meals a day to giant community hubs run by local authorities as well as charities and schools across the capital.The Independent\u0026nbspis encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

Not testing capacity at 100,000.“We’re still not carrying out the numbers of tests we need to. In particular we should be doing so much more to test care workers.

Emphasising devotion while fasting and developing an affinity with fellow Muslims, this time would usually see gatherings at mosques, homes and out on\u0026nbspthe streets.But widespread restrictions have been implemented around the world, including a ban in Turkey on tents designed to offer\u0026nbspfree fast-breaking iftar dinners and pre-dawn suhoor meals. Citizens there are also forbidden\u0026nbspfrom tipping drummers walking through the streets to wake people for their last meal before dawn, with the country responding after nearly\u0026nbsp100,000 cases and 2,259 fatalities as of Wednesday afternoon, according to Johns Hopkins University.\u0026nbspCharity tables have also been barred in Egypt, though there have been just\u0026nbsp3,490 cases with\u0026nbspthe death total currently at 264.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSaudi Arabia has suspended visas for Muslims seeking to take pilgrimages to Mecca and Medina, while Iranian President Hassan Rouhani\u0026nbspwas apologetic\u0026nbspafter\u0026nbspannouncing a ban on the country’s\u0026nbspusual ceremonies and forbidding the public from\u0026nbspattending holy shrines and mosques for two more weeks at least. Pakistan has walked back restrictions on\u0026nbspgroups of five or less able to\u0026nbspattend prayers at mosques though after\u0026nbspclashes between\u0026nbspworshipers and police.A sombre mood is likely to overshadow much of the month, though the nature of Islam could help Muslims cope better in these\u0026nbsptesting circumstances.“It’s going to be different and difficult in certain circumstances, but Islam is a very flexible religion, it covers for all circumstances, so the usual worship we would do in mosques, we can do them at home, there’s no harm in that given the situation,”\u0026nbspFarhad Ahmad, an Imam\u0026nbspat Fazl Mosque in London, tells The Independent.“During Ramadan we increase our worship, doing more goodness towards others, paying more to charity. So in a way, given everybody is now at home already, you’re self-isolating or in quarantine, that is sort of a natural phenomena that usually happens in Ramadan anyway, as people become more devout and less social anyway.“It’s a bit different to what some people think about Ramadan. Being forced into it is not the ideal situation, Ramadan doesn’t say don’t go to work or see your friends, but at the same time, there’s an emphasis to reflect on life, spend more time worshipping God, so this opportunity has made us more aware that we can do this more comfortably.”Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastIndeed the practice of itikaf – solitary confinement during\u0026nbspthe final days of Ramadan in a mosque – means that many Muslims may be accustomed to their current circumstances, even if they are now at home rather than a place of worships. While many\u0026nbspmosques are now putting on\u0026nbsponline\u0026nbspexercise classes and lectures to the burden on people\u0026nbspduring this time.“Some people are going through a difficult time with anxiety, depression or mental health issues,” Mr Ahmad adds. “But if you’re unwell or ill, Islam says you’re not supposed to fast.

His government has “made mistakes” — and so has ours.But presidents and prime ministers have a lot on their plates. When it comes to health alarms, they rely on experts.It would take a very brave prime minister indeed to ignore the people appointed to safeguard the nation’s health when lives are at risk.And the advice from those experts — the sprawling Public Health England in particular — was that Britain faced no more than a larger-than-usual dose of winter flu.PHE was against German-style mass testing and, when caught flat-footed, rejected help from commercial laboratories in providing those tests.PHE failed to build stocks of personal protective equipment — including masks, gowns and gloves — despite a  test run showing these were a priority.PHE dragged its feet over sourcing ventilators for intensive-care patients and extra hospital beds.Frequently when running short of crucial gear, PHE resisted offers of outside help, leaving the NHS scrambling to catch up.And when it came to opening London’s ,-bed Nightingale emergency hospital, it was the Army that did the job in nine days.It was also PHE who insisted the British public would be protected by “herd immunity”.The sooner  per cent of the population had contracted the virus and become immune, the better, it said.Boris faithfully followed their lead until another expert, Prof Neil Ferguson, issued a nightmare prediction of , dead unless Britain was locked up overnight.It was Ferguson who in the Blair years forecast mass burials on the scale of the Great Plague during the “Mad Cow” scare and the foot-and-mouth outbreak.Neither Armageddon scenario came remotely close.Once this is over and the inevitable inquiry is held, Boris and his government will inevitably be in the dock.So will PHE, a fiercely territorial quango with a giant £.billion budget.Much of this goes on pay and perks for well-cushioned executives, with  staff on six-figure salaries — a nanny-state rich list.Its website boasts its job is to “protect and improve the nation’s health and wellbeing”.And yet this box-ticking bureaucracy — obsessed with sugary drinks and ersity — has failed at the first hurdle.It shares with the higher reaches of the NHS a suspicion of fleet-footed commercial rivals and deep-seated hostility to the “profit motive”.Criticism, still muted, is widespread within the medical community, including frontline doctors and consultants.Every Thursday at pm, a grateful nation stands and applauds NHS staff working around the clock to save lives at the risk of their own.The same cannot be said for the inflexible, politically correct quango that binds the hands of medical staff in the name of an outdated socialist credo on health provision: State good, private bad.Much will need to change after Covid-. And that change must start with Public Health England.MINISTERS are looking at a traffic-light system to lt lockdown. Red for Stop, green for Go, with amber in between.Overzealous cops and councils are being reined in. ­Common sense is taking over. Families can now attend funerals.We might be able to say goodbye to dying ­relatives. Parks will reopen to the ­public. Benches have been deemed safe to sit on.So how about allowing non-contact sporting activities that boost both physical and mental health Swimming pools are surely safe.

On each phone there is an app that reports back to the authorities on the users’ health and online activities.Nor is there any escape in the home. The very concept of privacy barely exists when the state can use sophisticated technology to keep watch on our behaviour.This vision sounds like a nightmare, but it could become all too real thanks to the coronavirus.In its fallout, Covid- may end up causing as much damage to our essential freedoms as to our health - with the new menace of Big Brother on its way.Already the current emergency has led to the first comprehensive lockdown in British history.Evenit has been necessary to slow the spread of the virus, it is nevertheless a draconian measure that would have been unthinkable only a few weeks ago.Effectively the entire public has been placed under house arrest.Normal le has been brought juddering to a halt, while the police have been given unprecedented powers to enforce the quarantine.Even sitting for too long on a park bench or taking a leisurely drive have become offences against the state.With heroic stoicism, the vast majority of people have accepted this policy, seeing it as the only realistic means to protect the NHS and lessen the transmission of coronavirus.They hope that once the worst of the crisis has passed, there will be ato the Britain that they love, where inidual rights are respected and the power of the state is limited.Above all, this is my deepest wish too - though the chances look slim.One of the reasons why I, as an Irishman, admire this country so much is because of the British tradition of liberty, reflected in Magna Carta, parliamentary democracy and the defeat of Nazi tyranny.Unfortunately, even when the current lockdown is lted, it is possible that heavy-handed control by the state will remain.Quarantine may be temporary, but authoritarianism could be permanent.This is because officialdom, shaken by the unexpected scale of the coronavirus crisis, will be determined to prevent its resurgence by any means necessary.That will involve far more than just the maintenance of social distancing and the wearing of face masks.An arsenal of other measures could be deployed in the fight.One will be the reintroduction of curfews at the first sign of any new flare up in cases.If there is such a setback, the mood of the authorities will be even more intolerant towards any breaches. Fines will be heavier, jail terms longer.The skies will be filled with the sound of helicopters and the sight of drones as police — or even the Army — embark on ruthless enforcement.Another change is likely to be the advent of biometric identity cards, backed up by a comprehensive database of the entire population.Such a system has long been the dream of bureaucrats in Whitehall, and the aftermath of the crisis provides the perfect excuse for its imposition.Its appeal is all the greater because the latest type of cards operate with biotechnology that scans eyes and fingerprints.Only last year, the European Union passed a regulation requiring all national identity card systems on the continent to comply with new biometric standards.The British state will not stop there in its new crusade.In the name of health protection, mobile phone companies could be required to share data on their clients.According to the New Statesman, British Telecom, which owns the EE network, is already “in talks with the Government about handing over phone location and usage data” for the purpose of monitoring adherence to the lockdown.Similarly, tracking apps on devices could also be made obligatory so that the Government will be able to trace the contacts of anyone infected and ensure compliance with quarantine rules.Just as some criminals on release have to wear electronic tags, anyone who has tested positive for the virus may be ordered to wear a medical wristband even when self-isolation is over.Alternatively, those who test negative could be given immunity certicates.These initiatives will be accompanied by a political drive to reinforce support for the state, as happens in wartime.In a distinctly un-British way, people will be encouraged to snitch on those who fail to abide by the rules.Challenges to ruling orthodoxy will be seen as a form of subversion.If that sounds far-fetched, consider how laws to tackle discrimination or terrorism are now used to uphold fashionable ideology, as highlighted in the outrageous recent case where Lincolnshire businessman Harry Miller was questioned by police for allegedly sending a “transphobic” tweet.In the new Britain scarred by corona, the whole relationship between the state and the public will be inverted.The Government is meant to be accountable to the people.But, burdened with ID cards, curfews and tracking apps, the people will be accountable to the Government.There is an echo here of the George Orwell’s novel , which painted a terrying picture of Britain under totalitarian rule.In Orwell’s society gripped by permanent crisis, the citizenry were monitored day and night by the state.The propaganda and all-seeing eye of Big Brother could never be avoided, “always watching and the voice enveloping you, asleep or awake, indoors or outdoors, in the bath or in bed.In the present global crisis, many look to the experience of Asia, which has had far lower Covid death rates than the West.But that is a dangerous stance. First it ignores the fundamental point that China is responsible for the spread of this disease through its cover-up, persecution and lies.The country should be in the dock, not garnered with praise.Second it glosses over the oppressive nature of many of these Asian regimes, particularly that run by the tyrannical Chinese communist party.China has eagerly embraced new technology, like tracking devices, facial recognition cameras, eye-scanning security barriers and online data gathering, precisely because they drastically enhance the power of the state machine.Indeed, the country likes to boast that it is building the “world’s largest camera surveillance network”.As an example, in Guangzhou province, the commercial hub of southern China, tablets have been recently installed on buses to promote safety.Passengers are expected to lean their foreheads close to the tablet so that their photos and temperatures can be taken.China is also establishing a sinister “social credit system”, where behaviour is monitored to assess a citizen’s trustworthiness.Those given high ratings by the state can receive rewards like employment offers, shorter waiting times in hospitals and discounts at hotels.It is a recipe for bureaucratic despotism and political infantilisation.Other Asian nations, while nothing like as cruel as China, are also using technology as a tool to corral their public.Hong Kong has introduced mandatory wristbands for those in quarantine so they can be tracked.Taiwan has a monitoring system known as “the electronic fence” where those who are meant to be in isolation will be visited by the authoritiesthey turn off their mobiles.In South Korea, the government gathers huge amounts of data from phone records, CCTV images, and credit cards to help track citizens during the Covid crisis, while in Singapore, phone users are encouraged to download the “TraceTogether” app.This keeps a record of all the other numbers that have been in close proximity to the smartphone, making it easier to trace anyone who might have been near the owner in the event of a positive Covid-test.Not all of these developments are bad, provided they are genuinely used as weapons against disease rather than vehicles for the expansion of state power.But we have seen since   how the excuse of security can be used as a cover for bullying by the authorities, with the result that international air travel is often a miserable experience.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.”SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.We should not allow the same to happen on a national scale in the wake of the pandemic.As the great author C.S.Lewis wrote: “Of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive.It would be better to live under robber barons than omnipotent moral busybodies.”To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Smoking and sex are also banned.The month is traditionally viewed as an opportunity for devotion, reflection and celebration of the mercy and love of Allah , while the fasting ritual aids reflection on the suffering of others.Those observing the fast are encouraged to read the Quran and the holy text is recited at the Tarawih, special nightly prayers that would normally be held at mosques throughout the month but cant this year due to coronavirus.Coronavirus lockdown has hit all religions hard, with services and places of worship being shut down and moved online.Ramadan  is due to start today, April , in the evening.The Islamic calendar is based around the lunar cycle, the Holy month of Ramadan rotates by approximately ten days each year.The month is confirmed with the sighting of the new moon.Suhoor is the first meal of the day, a quick snack before fasting begins.Starting at .am on day one. Suhoor then happens roughly two minutes earlier every day.Iftar Magrib is when Muslims break fasting with a light meal and some water before having a proper dinner.This happens at sunset and will get later as the month progresses.Fasting will last between  hours and  minutes, and  hours and  minutes come Eid.You can find a more detailed timetable for your area here.Ramadan in the UK is predicted to end at pm exactly on May .Muslims celebrate with a massive -hour party involving family and friends called the feast of Eid al-Fitr.This celebration is marked with lights, decorations and gts, with worshippers often dressing up and decorating their homes.Sadly,lockdown is still in place by then, these parties will have to be familial events, or will need to take place online through video chats.The MCB is offering guidance on how to organise virtual tars online with loved ones and members of the community via video chat.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As I say, this baffling statement will make zero dference to their already fractured relationship with the UK.In an ideal world, every media outlet worldwide would form a pact that they will never again write about or use a photograph of the Sussexes.The effect would be swt and damning.For without the oxygen of publicity, what are they Married to a home-body, I have always rather envied those whose other halves travel frequently for their job.It gives you the house to yourself sporadicallyand makes you appreciate them when they .But in lockdown we are faring well because we are already used to being together most of the time.A friend whose husband usually travels for work called me the other day to say that his sudden, constant presence in the home was causing friction.And yesterday, Boyzone star Shane Lynch announced the sad news that lockdown has put his -year marriage to Sheena White under intolerable strain.He says: “I’m not even in my family home right now because me and her were at each other’s throats.“It wasn’t a good time or a good space.“I’m usually on the road and for the first time I’ve spent three months in my house . . . it can be a struggle.”Indeed it can. Let’s hope they sort it out for the sake of their two children.Now the dust has settled around Professor Neil Ferguson’s original estimate of , Covid deaths, it’s perhaps time to stand back and take a logical overview of the situation.While the death toll is still worrying, the mantra that we are critically harming the economy to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed is undermined by the news that many of the private hospitals repurposed for Covid patients are lying virtually empty and the ,-bed facility set up in London’s ExCel centre is only treating  people.It’s adding credence to the burgeoning mindset that, perhaps, those who are considered vulnerable should remain in lockdown while the rest of the country makes a gradualto school or work while maintaining strict social distancing measures.On GMB yesterday, a gruff, Swedish professor, whose name escaped me, was asked to explain the thinking behind his country’s policy to keep everything open.He replied: “People are not stupid.”In other words, the Swedes are taking personal responsibility for how they behave and, as of earlier this week, the death rate was starting to decline.It remains to be seen whether Sweden’s outlier stance proves to be the correct one, but one thing is for certain: Its economy may be weakened at the end of it, but it won’t be on the critical list like ours.Model and businessman David Gandy talked about the importance of fostering at the weekend, under the headline, “OMG. He’s so cute!”Indeed he is, was my immediate thought. My second was that I would happily foster him anytime.However, it turns out the headline and suggestion of benevolence was aimed at Dora, his rescue pup from Battersea Dogs Home, for which David is an ambassador.He says: “What I love about the evenings now is the calmness of a tired, sleeping dog at your side. I watch Dora dreaming.”Lucky Dora.One wondersshe knows that, when it comes to good fortune, she has won the canine equivalent of the Lottery.Last year, I read to kids in a primary school and, with rare exception, every time I asked what they wanted to be when they grew up, they replied: “A YouTuber.”Yet last week, while queuing behind a mother and her daughter outside the supermarket, the young girldeclared her desire to become a nurse when she left school.Now that is something positive to come out of the Covid- crisis.Jigsaws are getting me through the long days of lockdown.Despite The Bloke’s lame attempts to hide the last pieceI completed my fth at the weekend and, as an exercise in mindfulness, it’s right up there with any yoga retreat.So imagine my joy when Kodak announced last week that it has produced the world’s largest jigsaw with, gulp, , pieces.It is  separate images of world landmarks and, when finished, covers  square metres – about the size of a standard living room. Sadly, it also costs £, so I’ll stick to my ,-piece cheapies. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

First, the EU scheme has spectacularly failed to deliver anything.Indeed — as I suggest below — the EU is coming apart at the seams over this virus.And second, the invitation to join the scheme was sent, by those EU genii, to the wrong address. Duh.It is becoming more apparent with every day that passes that the civil service is the biggest impediment to the UK reforming itself.It is hostile to the Government, to the people — and deeply hostile to change of any kind.It is a vast congregation of time-serving bureaucrats dedicated only to saving their own jobs.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealEven now, red tape may be stling our efforts to deal with the coronavirus.It will be interesting to discover, once this pandemic has receded, what part the civil service played in the UK’s failure to carry out adequate testing for the virus, right from the start.And the failure to bring in vital equipment.Government ministers carry the can for these sorts of failures, of course.But it is the civil service charged with enacting the decisions.I wonder how many ventilators have failed to arrive here because of some bureaucratic hitch I wonder what would have happenedthe civil service, rather than the military, were charged with building those Nightingale hospitals.They might just about be ready by the end of the century.It was clear, when this Government came to office, that the real opposition wasn’t the ragged hounds and trots on the Labour benches, but from the very people paid to enable the government — the civil service.There needs to be a clear-out, from the top down.Because this battle — between civil servants and Government ministers — will continue long after this virus has been defeated.Their opposition to Government policy hampers almost everything we do.That’s no way to run a country.I see The Vicar Of Dibley is back. Dawn French will reprise her role as the Rev Geraldine Granger for the BBC’s Big Night In this evening.That should cheer us up for a few moments.Here are a few more sitcoms they could update to keep us laughing through the lockdown:Some Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em – Frank Spencer is appointed Health Secretary and has to give briefings every day to the Press. Ooh, Betty, the hilarity.Till Death Us Do Part – Alf Garnett, in self isolation, kindly explains to us what he thinks of some Chinese culinary practices and the Chinese government.Both Feet In The Grave – sadly, there was no ventilator for Victor.Not Going Out – huge laughs as a large number of people don’t, er, go out.Are You Being Served  – um . . .  no, actually.Dad’s Army – Captain Mainwaring orders his men to build a new hospital in two days flat, with hilarious consequences.On The Buses – Stan and Jack vow to wreak revenge on the idiots who won’t give them PPE.How’s the home- schooling coming along then Got the kids up at eight every morning to do a bit of calculus I’ve been enjoying it, although I maybe haven’t given enough attention to mathematics.But it’s been a good chance to redress some of the crap my daughter has been subjected to in ten years of state education.She now has a slightly dferent take on the British Empire, the poverty of Africa and how fun it might be to transition into being a bloke.A mad woman in America has warned that home-schooling is “dangerous”. Why Professor of Law Elizabeth Bartholet said: “It’s always dangerous to put powerful people in charge of the powerless.”.She added that it gave parents “authoritarian control” over the kids.You mean like the authoritarian control they’ve had from the teachers all these years, love It’s comforting to know that even in this crisis, the liberals are still as deranged as ever.You’ve got to feel sorry for Victoria Beckham, haven’t you Poor woman says that last week was the worst of her le.She’s bitterly disappointed with you, the British people.She thinks we were all terribly arsey about her when she decided to use our money to furlough her fashion company workers.How could we be so mean as to expect a woman who has an estimated wealth of £million – acquired largely through singing badly – should dig into her own pockets.Rather than scrounging off the taxpayer.The stinking rich really don’t get it, do they No self awareness whatsoever – and even less shame.But then never mind the witless Posh, whose useless company loses millions every year.Look at old beardo Branson – Sir Richard, entrepreneur and “philanthropist”.He wants YOU to pay HIM £million to bail out his airline, Virgin.This is a man who has paid not a single penny of income tax in the UK for fourteen years.But when his company is in trouble he expects you to bail him out.And this from a bloke who has already been coining it from the taxpayer for his awful rail franchises.This kind of bare-faced cheek almost beggars belief.Or there’s Apple boss Tim Cook boasting about sending a few safety masks to the UK.SO kind of you, Tim.Now how about your company pays its proper share of tax in the UK  Then we might not need your charity.Pope Francis has pleaded with the EU for countries to “come together” to fight the virus.Ha. Fat chance, your Popeship.The European Union is falling apart as a consequence of this crisis.All the member states have been doing the sensible thing – and ignoring everything the EU bureaucrats have to say.Germany introduced very tough anti-immigration measures, for example.But the EU has been criticised for abandon- ing Spain and Italy.There are big rows over a joint debt fund to help the worst-hit countries.There are arguments over what phone app should be used to track virus carriers.One leading European economist said that the EU was in danger of “imploding”.Ah well – every cloud, huh I CAN’T get to my usual snippers in Saltburn. So my we and daughter kindly agreed to cut my hair for me. They gave me a kind of Mohican.I think it’s great. The new me. Liddle, back in the game. Watch out, chicks.KIM JONG-UN is apparently very ill. Nothing to do with the coronavirus.The morbidly obese weirdo who runs North Korea is thought to be under-going serious heart surgery.He’s getting his reward then, for eating like a king while the rest of his country starves. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Everybody is very clear on that.“If you actually have symptoms you need to isolate, full stop.“A cloth mask is not a replacement for staying at home and nobody should think otherwise.”Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the Government is following SAGE advice, but will not be handing out free masks, as some other countries have.He added: “We have to make sure we have supplies available for health and care staff.”Prof Whitty also warned ministers today they face dficult “trade-offs” when they review the lockdown again by May , when the three-week extension ends.He said SAGE is working on options to ease some restrictions, but they will have downsides.None could happen until the rate of transmission ­— known as R — was below one person giving it to one other “at any point”.Prof Whitty added: “We have to be very realisticpeople are hoping it’s suddenly going to move from where we are in lockdown to where suddenly everything is gone.“That is a wholly unrealistic expectation.“If you release more on one area, you have to keep on board more of another area so there’s a proper trade-off.”He added: “It does not take very long from bad numbers to really bad numbers.”No  officials refer to what happens after May  as the “next phase”.A “suck-it-and-see” plan is being drawn up based on scientists’ data to see what restrictions to try easing first.One senior figure told The Sun: “We will try a bit at a time, and then pause, so we can see what effect that has on the transmission rate.

They’re not dficult and there are many designs, including ours on Page  of Thursdays newspaper. We must NOT deplete supplies of professionally produced kit for NHS or care staff who are in direct contact with Covid-positive patients.Masks, plus other measures including radical changes to working hours to avoid rush-hour crowds, will help lessen the spread when the lockdown is relaxed, as it must be soon.Let’s not kid ourselves: infections are still bound to increase. But there are no good options now. We cannot continue bankrupting Britain and shedding millions of jobs with this paralysis.We cannot wait for a vaccine, nor for “herd immunity” to be achieved via most of the active population getting the virus and recovering. Both look a mile off.A better bet is some new or repurposed antiviral drug to cut deaths. But we cannot wait for that either.The lockdown must be gradually lted, starting next month, before further catastrophic damage is done to our economy, our society and the long-term health of our nation.We must continue to shield the most vulnerable and prevent a devastating second wave of infections overwhelming the NHS in a way the first did not.And we must deploy whatever weapons we have to slow Covid-.Masks at work, in shops and on public transport  Fine.

Weve lost too many lives already.When you follow the guidelines, when you stay home, you are doing something directly personally that is not just helping the NHS, but saving lives.BQ had been closed since the end of March since the introduction of lockdown measures to try to contain the spread of Covid-.Customers had been able to use click and collect services to purchase goods after hardware stores were included on the governments list of essential retailers.The store carried out a trial in  stores over the weekend and opened them fully - with restrictions.It today opened a further  stores and pictures show Brits following rules as they patiently queue to enter.A BQ spokesperson said: As an essential retailer, we’re committed to providing the best possible service to support customers’ home improvement needs at this dficult time, while keeping customers and colleagues safe.Having watched other essential retailers support social distancing in their stores, we are now following their best practice and are re-opening some stores with strict social distancing measures in place.Similar to shopping at a supermarket, we’re strictly limiting the number of customers in store at any one time, and so customers are typically queueing before entering stores.All stores have a designated queuing area outside and these have two metre markers to help remind everyone to respect each other’s personal space.To further support social distancing, we have two metre floor markers throughout the store and have also installed perspex screens at the checkouts.We’re urging all customers to follow the Government’s social distancing guidelines, to shop responsibly only for what is necessary and to be patient whilst we give them the best possible service in the safest possible way.The warm and sunny weather has made coronavirus lockdown even harder for Brits, with it forecast to be hotter than Lanzerote today and tomorrow.It brings fears the temperature will be too tempting for some as the weekend arrives at the end of five weeks of being stuck indoors.Most of the country will enjoy the balmy weather, with temperatures hitting C in Wales and C in Scotland.The shocked journalist who saw the footballers in Burgess Park yesterday tweeted: Not surprising that Southwark is one of the worst-hit London boroughs from #COVID.

we are going to expose more people to the virusHe said it was essential to open up parts of the economy, to rescue them from being completely decimated by the lockdown.I see no reason why garden centres, DIY stores with proper social isolating couldnt begin to open.Sir Geoffrey and other members of the  Committee of Tory backbenchers called a private meeting yesterday where they unanimously expressed deep concern of the continual lockdown, according to The Times.Sir Geoffrey said: The nation is quite ided on this and its up to the government, I think, to exercise leadership.Unless we do something fairly soon the economy is going to take a real hit.Vice Chairman of the committee Sir Charles Walker said There has got to be an economy to go back to.All MPs right now are dealing with dozensnot hundreds of local businesses that are fearing for their future.Building capacity within the NHS, reducing infection rates has to be the precursor to lting the economic lockdown.

At its best, the monarchy shines light on dark places, telling stories that would otherwise go untold and standing up for what’s right.It has been said that the Royal Family’s first obligation is to give back to the British people who fund them. I agree wholeheartedly. It is gravely concerning that these former royals, over many years, have sought to insulate themselves from taking accountability for what they say or do — even when they know it to be distorted,  and completely tone-deaf.When power is enjoyed without responsibility, the trust we all place in these very privileged people is degraded.It is a really hypocritical way of doing business and, quite frankly, it bores every corner of society.I have watched the Duke and Duchess of Sussex ditch crown and country at a time of need, by private jet, to make millions in Hollywood — for no good reason other than the fact they simply cannot bear the fair and honest reporting a free Press brings.With that said, please note I will not be engaging with Harry and Meghan’s PR spin. There will be no corroboration and zero engagement.This policy is also being instated for their long-suffering communications team. My heart truly goes out to their lone UK staffer James Holt, although I have far less sympathy for the dodgy practices offered by Hollywood PR company Sunshine Sachs— a side of the industry relating to celebrities readers never see.This policy is not about avoiding criticising Harry and Meghan.I’ll always be honest. It’s not about shutting down public conversation or censoring accurate reporting.The media have every right to report on — and indeed, have an opinion on — the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, good or bad. But it can’t be based on their lies.I also want to be very clear: This is not in any way a blanket policy for all royals .I’m looking forward to working with other dukes and duchesses all over the country, engaging with members of the Royal Family senior and junior and young up-and-coming royalsto spotlight issues and causes that desperately need acknowledging.And I look forward to doing whatever I can to help further opportunities for more under-represented royals, who are needed now more than ever .What I won’t do is offer myself up to the constant spin, fact-twisting and putdowns of their family members I’ve had to put up with fromHarry and Meghan’s long-suffering staff for the past two years.I’m that encouraged this new approach will be heard and respected.Sun readers deserve to know what’s REALLY going on.NETFLIX managed to achieve the impossible this week with sex-obsessed new reality show Too Hot To Handle.They found a cast of millennials more backstabbing, vain, stupid and horny than ITV have ever managed with Love Island, which looks totally tame in comparison.It’s the biggest mind-numbing abomination I’ve seen on television in a very long time.But can I be totally honest with you – I absolutely loved every minute. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The document adds: If, after easing any restrictions, the evidence tells us we are unable to contain the transmission of the virus then we will have to re-impose them, possibly ing to lockdown with little notice. While we will do our best to avoid this, it is possible that such a cycle may happen more than once until we reach a point when we have in place an effective vaccine. While the paper was produced by the Scottish government, it gives an insight into the sort of approaches that might eventually be taken across the whole of the UK. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon sits in COBRA meetings with the UK government, and the four home nations have broadly taken the same approach to the lockdown. The UK government has refused to comment on its own exit plan, saying people must focus on the message of staying home to protect the NHS. But Downing Street today appeared to voice a similar approach to the possibility of multiple lockdowns to the Scottish government. The PMaposs spokesman said the most important factor is that R, the number of people each carrier infects, is below one. We cannot allow the R to go above one for any extended period at any point, he said. No also did not contradict Englandaposs Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty, who last night said some restrictions will need to last until .Boris Johnsonaposs said the government must do everything we can to keep the infection rate down.

At the daily Downing Street briefing, Mr Hancock said the capacity for carrying out tests was now ahead of our plans, with the ability to carry out more than , tests a day. But he still faces a huge hurdle to climb to reach his , target - almost double current levels - in a weekaposs time. Because capacity has now increased so substantially, we are now able to expand who can get the tests, he said. Our ultimate goal is that everyone who could benefit from a test gets a test. Mr Hancock said: Itaposs all part of getting Britain back on her feet. But you may have to drive for a -minute round trip to get a test and there could be heavy demand on new kits to be posted to your home. Hereaposs who is eligible and how the system will work. Who is eligible for a test  Those who the government has classied as essential workers in England and members of their households. The government say they hope that the devolved administrations will follow suit.In the UK there are around million people classed as essential workers but their households will also be eligible under the scheme.NHS staff and care home workers are already being referred for testing by their workplaces. But now other workers will be eligible. It it the same list of occupations used by the government to determine whether or not you can continue to send your children to school during lockdown. Key workers on the list are the same as those for access to schools, and include NHS and social care workers, police officers, teachers, social workers, those in the justice system, undertakers, some in local government, supermarket and food production workers, journalists, transport workers and some people in utilities and IT.A full list is below or on this web page.How sick do you have to be   You need to show symptoms in order to be tested. The main two are a new and persistent dry cough and a temperature. But other people who have tested positive for covid- include losing taste and a sense of smell.    It will showyou currently have Covid-. This is useful to proveyour symptoms are actually the virus. It does not showyouaposve had Covid- in the past. It will help people work out when they and their household members canto work safely. Where do I log on to book a test Visit the governmentaposs web page. Where do I go to get tested     The first port of call is a drive-through testing centre -  of which are currently open, with  promised by the end of April. The government expects you to be able to drive for up to  minutes from your home to get to a drive-through site, leaving some with potentially a -minute round trip. WhatI canapost drive     For those who donapost live near enough to a testing site or canapost drive there are other options. The government has pledged that Royal Mail and Amazon will deliver home testing kits for the first time from Friday. While the availability of these will be limited at first, officials claim they will reach , per day. Itaposs not clear when. What about other ways of getting tested  Meanwhile apossatelliteapos test kits are also being sent directly to care homes to enable residents with symptoms to be tested. And the Army is helping set up mobile testing units which will travel the country to places like care homes, police stations and prisons. Itaposs not clear how these will help workers without a mobile unit or satellite kit at their place of work. How long will I wait for results     Test results from the drive-through sites will be sent out by text within  hours, the government says. For home delivery tests, the waiting time is  hours. Itaposs not clear how quickly a test will be booked in once youaposve asked for it - presumably it depends on demand. Why are essential workers getting tested  The aim is simple - to ensure they can get back to work. Because the test showsyou currently have Covid-, it also can given an indication that your cough is just a  alarm. So people whoaposve been self-isolating to protect others due to a mild cough can get back on the front line. Whataposs it like getting the test   The test involves taking a swab  of the nose and throat - and it goes back pretty far, so be prepared. A single swab is used to collect a liquid sample from the back of your throat and your nose. This swab is then placed into a sample tube and securely packaged, where it is sent to the lab for testing. Depending on where you get tested, you will either have a clinician take your swab or be asked to do it yourself.

He set out plans to ramp up testing, and said NHS bosses are trialling an app which could warn peopletheyaposve been exposed to Covid-. Today the government said all essential workers and their families are now eligible for Covid- tests - but questions remain over how this will be delivered. Mr Hancock said home testing kits are being rolled out, to be delivered by Amazon, while the Army is helping set up a mobile testing facility for places like care homes.It comes after Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned there would be noto normal this year.Mr Hancock said , people have been recruited to help contact tracing measures, and the army would be running mobile testing facilities. Home tests are also set to be made available, the minister said at todayaposs Number  briefing. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here He said: Test, track and trace, done effectively, can help to suppress the transmission in a way that allows you then to have lesser rules. Critically, test, track and trace works more effectively when the rate of new cases is lower. So, the lower the rate of new cases, the more effectively you can keep it down using test, track and trace rather than having to use heavier social-distancing measures. Brits have only been allowed to leave their home for essential travel and exercise since March . The current restrictions are in place until May , but Mr Hancock would not be drawn on whether it is likely to be lted - saying there must be no second peak. He reiterated that five tests need to be met in order to lt the lockdown - including a fall in the number of deaths and new infections.  Mr Hancock resisted demands for more transparency about how the lockdown would be ended. The Health Secretary said: I understand the thirst for knowledge. The tests that we have set out, which are the basis from which others - for instance the Scottish Government - have then developed their plans, those tests are the critical tests for when changes can be made. Of course, monitoring what is happening and making sure that we move at the right time is absolutely critical.  But the message remains the same - that people need to stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives. The reason that we have clarity on that message is that it has succeeded in bringing down and flattening the curve, but we are not through that yet and thereaposs an awful lot of work that still needs to be done, and we are absolutely determined to avoid a second peak. Chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said people must keep up their commitment to social distancing, saying: Itaposs heading in the right direction, we must stay firm with the measures weaposre taking. Sir Patrick said there may be up to two or three weeks dferences in some places - so itaposs not that London is two weeks ahead of everywhere.  Thereaposs actually a lot of similarities across a number of areas, including big urban areas, and so I donapost think you should take the message at all that there is two weeks dference between London and the rest of the country. He said reducing lockdown measures was not as straightforward as saying that because you hit the peak two weeks early you can release things two weeks early. What needs to happen before lockdown is lted   . The NHS must be able to cope The slogan that the Government has championed from the start has been clear - Stay at home. Protect the NHS. Many of the measures put in place - including the opening of the Nightingale Hospital at the NEC in Birmingham, have been to reduce the burden that Covid- is having on the NHS. The last thing the Government wants is thousands upon thousands of patients needing medical treatment all at once, so until there is confidence that the NHS can cope, lockdown will remain in place.  . Fall in deathsThe daily death total makes for a grim reading each day, with hundreds of deaths recorded in hospitals as a result of coronavirus.And sadly, with deaths occurring in public and care facilities, the real number is almost certainly much higher. Mr Raab said the government will want to see a apossustained and consistent fall in deathsapos before any decision to lt restrictions will be made.

AskedProf Whitty was right, and highly disruptive measures could remain in place for that period, the PMaposs official spokesman said: The key to this is not having a second peak.Having a second peak would be bad not only on health grounds, but also bad for business and the economy. We have to do everything we can to keep R below one and prevent that second peak. In terms of the steps we take in the coming weeks and months will be guided by the scientic advice. It’s not sensible for me to pre-empt that. aposRapos refers to the number of people each virus carrier infects on average. If it is more than one, the virus spreads exponentially. If it is less than one, it dies back. The No spokesman added the most important factor is that R, the rate of transmission, needs to be below one. We cannot allow the R to go above one for any extended period at any point.  He went on: I think the Chief Medical Officer set out in a signicant amount of detail the issues which himself and his colleagues and then ministers will have to look at as we go forward.

Senior Tory Geoffrey Clton-Brown told the BBC: We need to start this discussion about how we get back to normality. We could begin to think about what are the next steps on a step-by-step basis.

Downing Street will reportedly ask businesses to introduce staggered start times for their employees to reduce the possible spread of coronavirus. One option being touted would see the busy morning commute separated into three separate slots, with workers beginning their shts at am, am and pm. Bosses could also be asked to introduce weekend working or working alternate days instead of the typical Monday to Friday week.

The measures are due to next be reviewed on May  and Health Secretary Matt Hancock, in an indication the lockdown will be eased then, said he was preparing to ramp up contact tracing on a large scale as a way of keeping the virus under control. In the Commons on Tuesday, Mr Hancock said he was confident the country was at the peak of the outbreak but stressed that continued social distancing was currently needed to bring the number of new cases down.  He also said a contact tracing app which will alert peoplethey have been in contact with somebody with the virus and should self-isolate was currently in trials. He said: “We have to make sure we’ve got that evidence before we start touting around ideas. “The minute we can responsibly do so based on the evidence, we will.” Passenger numbers in London are down around % on the Tube and % on buses, cutting income from fares to a fraction of normal levels. The capitalaposs mayor said that TfL had lost hundreds of millions of pounds of revenue as a result of the measures.  Mr Khan said: Unless the Government gives us a grant, we will not be able to continue to run the service we have. Mr Khanaposs comments come after Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram, the metro mayors for Greater Manchester and the Liverpool City Region respectively, called for Government funding to support city centre transport. Mr Burnham said Manchesteraposs link system may have to be suspended as it was losing millions of pounds a month. Merseyrail, which operates in Liverpool and surrounding areas, was losing £. million a week and was being reduced to a core service for essential workers, Mr Rotheram said. Last month, the Department for Transportsuspended traditional rail franchise agreements to avoid train companies collapsing, but the metro mayors said the rail systems in their cities had not been given any support.

The critical workers and their families will be able to book a test on a Government websitethey are displaying symptoms. Some , contact tracers will be hired to identy those who have come into close contact with an infected person so they can be quarantined. The dramatic expansion is part of the effort to ramp up both testing and contact tracing as the Government considers how to ease restrictions. Public Health England wants the system up and running in three weeks so it can be usedthe Government wants to ease restrictions at the next lockdown review on May . Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was part of “getting Britain back on her feet”. He added: “Testing, tracking and tracing, done effectively, can help to suppress the transmission in a way that allows you to have lesser social distancing rules.” But with testing capacity standing at slightly over , – and just , actual tests carried out yesterday – there are fears the Government will struggle to meet demand. It remains some way off from delivering on its pledge of , tests by the end of the month, with NHS and care staff already struggling to get them.  The criteria for which key workers qualy for tests will be similar to those used to decide whose children can still attend school. They will have to display current symptoms for the tests to work, as no successful antibodies test has yet been devised. Tests will be offered at dozens of drive-through sites, at mobile laboratories or at home, with up to , kits a day sent out via Amazon. Results from the drive-through sites will be sent out by text within  hours, and within  hours of collection of the home delivery tests.  Wales has already announced plans to expand testing to key workers including delivery drivers, food production workers, utility workers and key public service staff. Another  hospital deaths were announced yesterday, taking the total to ,, though the true figure including care home deaths could be more than ,. At the daily No press conference yesterday, Mr Hancock claimed capacity for carrying out tests had expanded “ahead of our plans”. Chief Scientic Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the Government was “on track” to delivering , tests a day in six days’ time. There are now just  drive-through sites – though ministers promised up to  within a week – and just four mobile labs, though the Army is expected to help deliver more. Cabinet minister Brandon Lewis said: “I think it’s dreadful that we can’t get more people tested. That’s why it’s important we do upscale the ability for people to access these tests.”  But Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: “We have urged the Government to do more testing and consistently questioned why ministers were not moving to a test-and-trace strategy. It is crucial that greater numbers of critical workers are now able to access testing.”It came as the first two volunteers – a microbiologist and a cancer researcher – started trials for a coronavirus vaccine at Oxford University yesterday. One was given the coronavirus dose while another was given a meningitis vaccine for comparison.Microbiologist Elisa Granato, who took part in the trial on her nd birthday, said: “I felt like this is a very easy way for me to support the cause.” Cancer researcher Edward O’Neill said: “It seems like the right thing to do.” Prof Sarah Gilbert, leading the team, said she was optimistic about the chances of success. The Oxford Vaccine Group hopes to repeat the process with six more volunteers on Saturday, moving to larger numbers on Monday. Up to , participants will be recruited across study sites in Oxford, Southampton, London and Bristol. The Cabinet met virtually yesterday to discuss how to start lting restrictions as the UK gets through the peak of the virus. One minister told the Mirror: “Testing, tracing and tracking is now the key priority. We hope the testing will now accelerate.” Yet just weeks ago Government health experts said mass testing, as carried out successfully in South Korea, was “not appropriate” for the UK. Downing Street appeared to admit yesterday that some of the restrictions could have to stay in place until next year. The Prime Minister’s spokesman did not deny claims by England’s Chief Medical Officer that “very socially disruptive measures” could be needed into next year.

The letter stressed the need for a phased approach to avoid a #xCyo-yo effect#xD of openings and closings which could see businesses fail and up to a million jobs lost. The six-point plan sets out the level of support the sector needs to reintegrate into the economy, to avoid mass redundancies and to ensure local businesses and high-street brands can survive. Recommendations included extending the Government#xs furlough scheme beyond the end of June for hospitality businesses, legislative intervention on rent payments, improved access to capital and an overhaul of business regulation. UKHospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said: #xCWith social distancing measures still in place, reopening the hospitality sector without a plan would be catastrophic. #xCThe hospitality sector was one of the first hit by the crisis and the hardest hit in terms of lost revenue. It will also be one of the last to fully emerge from the lockdown. #xCAn extended period of social distancing will mean that many hospitality businesses will not be able to operate fully, and many will not be able to open at all. Hospitality is a sector built around socialising, so there must be Government support for businesses that continue to be hit by this crisis. #xCWe need a plan of phased opening for our sector. For those businesses that can trade safely with social distancing measures still in place, they should be able to. #xCFor the many venues where it is not possible, support, such as the furlough scheme, must be extended to make sure these businesses stay alive and jobs kept open. We can#xt have a situation where, overnight, the entire sector is suddenly expected to hit the ground running. #xCIf the correct support is not in made available to help businesses get back to work when the time is right, then businesses will have survived the immediate crisis only to find themselves out of business during the aftermath.#xD\",\"author\":[,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-pandemic-uk-live-updates-\",\",\"author\":[,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-pandemic-uk-live-updates-\",Read more here. \",\"author\":[,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-pandemic-uk-live-updates-\",\",\"author\":[,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-pandemic-uk-live-updates-\",\",\"author\":[,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-pandemic-uk-live-updates-\", The number of confirmed cases in the country rose by , to ,.\",\"author\":[,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-pandemic-uk-live-updates-\",hay fever.

Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said there was #xCrelatively low confidence#xD that a shipment of , surgical gowns which had been due to arrive in the UK from Turkey on Sunday would make its way into the country on Monday. The lack of PPE remains a dominant issue for NHS staff, as hospitals are forced into workarounds, including washing equipment and asking workers to accept wearing less protective gear. The NHS Confederation, which represents organisations across healthcare, has also reacted angrily to Government promises of more PPE, saying delays on the shipment from Turkey #xCmakes a dficult situation worse#xD. Its chief executive, Niall Dickson, said: #xCIt would have been better had the Government not made the announcement in the first place#xD and said staff would need to make their own assessment over whether they felt safe with the PPE currently on offer. Mr Hopson told Radio #xs Today programme that it was wrong to focus on inidual consignments of PPE because #xCbitter experience over the last few weeks#xD has shown they cannot be relied upon, with some boxes containing the wrong items and thousands of pieces missing. #xCSo rather than being marched up to the top of the hill and being marched back down again, let#xs just focus on what we know we can be certain of,#xD he said. #xCLet#xs not focus on inidual consignments, let#xs try and get as quickly as possible to a sustainable supply of these gowns. #xCThere#xs no doubt that at the moment, we have now got trusts that have definitely got shortages of gowns.#xD Mr Hopson said trusts were reserving the stock of fluid-resistant gowns they do have for areas of high clinical risk, such as intensive care units, and using workarounds in other areas. #xCThere#xs one trust that#xs basically discovered thatyou launder those gowns at  degrees ... there#xs probably up to three times that you can do that, and the gowns appear to still be fully fluid-repellent,#xD he said.

Hayley, from Liverpool, said: “I told him she was visually impaired and got frightened of people talking over or down on her.  “When she came in, he got down on one knee, held her hand and had a full conversation with her, chatting away. “He sent everyone  out of the room and just spent time with the two of them. It was an incredible moment.” Because of the lockdown, only a handful of mourners could attend Holly’s funeral but the family asked supporters to wear pink instead.

It was a very special day for the Cambridges and the rest of the Royal Family, but it will also go down in history. When Kate gave birth to her third child at .am, Charlotte made his history thanks to a change in the law years before. The little princess became the first female royal to retain her claim to the throne and not be bumped down the line by the arrival of a new male. The change is thanks to the Succession to the Crown Act . It states: In determining the succession to the Crown, the gender of a person born after  October  does not give that person, or that person’s descendants, precedence over any other person . If this change hadnapost been introduced Princess Charlotte, who is currently fourth in line to the throne, would have been bumped down to fth and Louis would have taken her old spot. Instead, Louis is fth in the line of succession after his grandfather Prince Charles, dad Prince William and siblings George and Charlotte. The last woman to be affected by this is Princess Anne.  When she was born in August  she was second in line to the throne after her big brother Charles. However, before long the Queen and Prince Philip had welcomed Prince Andrew and Prince Edward. The boys overtook Ann, leaving her in fourth in line to the throne.  When she fell pregnant, she knew her children would be bumped even further down the list when their cousins were born, so opted against giving Zara and Peter HRH titles. This allowed them to lead more normal lives and have careers of their own. The world celebrated with Kate and William when they announced their little boy had been born.

He described the figure as terrying.Dr Sikora also said it was absurd that the new NHS Nightingale hospital in east London has remained largely unused. Health bosses have denied a report that transfers of patients with Covid- to the newly built NHS Nightingale in London were rejected due to a lack of nurses.

The unusual living situation has meant that Helen has only had access to a shower. The -year-old has really missed being able to relax in a bath - a fact sheaposs made plainly clear to Dave on numerous occasions. Fed up of her complaining, he decided to take matters into his own hands and built a makesht jacuzzi to aposshut her upapos - using the rusty bucket of a dumper truck. Dave, , turned the digger heaposd been using to build the house into a temporary spa day for Helen during lockdown, filling the bucket up with water and shower gel. Undaunted by the lack of electricity, Dave created bubbles using a hand drill with a plastering attachment to drive some air into the liquid. Once the water had warmed up, retired childminder Helen climbed in via a ladder, and enjoyed a glass of wine and a long awaited soak.  Speaking about the makesht jacuzzi, Helen said: It was absolute heaven to me. It was really lovely to relax. We’ve just been using a shower in the garage so to have a soak was really nice. Weaposve been in the garage for two years now, so I had been complaining about the lack of bath so Dave decided to shut me up. Once I was in there, I didnapost want to get out. I stayed in for a good half an hour, once I had finished my wine. We even had some walkers go by while I was in there and said it looked nice. We might have to look at renting it out when the house is finished.  She continued: It had to have a couple of days of sun to warm the water up. Weaposd filled it up on the Saturday and I finally got in on the Monday. Just to make sure, I had a shower first so I was already a bit wet and it meant it wasnapost as cold. Once Iaposd finished in the bath, we poured the water over the plants so we didnapost waste anything.

Retail outlets may then be given the green light to open a week later, followed by a full de-shuttering of restaurants from May . Restrictions on movements within the regions would be lted on May  under the plans, while inter-regional travel would remain outlawed.The proposals have not yet been agreed to but are being considered by the government, Ansa reports.

John-Paul Drike, the director of Drakes Supermarkets in Adelaide, Australia, says he responded simply by giving the alleged hoarder the middle finger. In a stunning YouTube video, the supermarket boss has vented his anger at those who have taken advantage of the desperate rush for basic household supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic. He claimed that one unidentied customer had been audacious enough to purchase  -roll packets of loo roll and  units of one-litre sanitiser from his shop - and then later ask for a refund. Follow the latest coronavirus updates here “I had my first customer yesterday who said he wanted to get a refund on  packets of -pack toilet paper and  units of one-litre sanitiser, Mr Drake says in his video on April . Flipping his middle finger at the screen, he added: “I told him that.  Branding those who have been panic-buying supplies such as toilet paper absolutely ridiculous, he continued: That is the sort of person that is causing the problem in the whole country. Speaking to News, he said the man wanted to get rid of the items because he was no longer able to sell them on eBay after his site was shut down. He claimed that he had as many as  people working with him to buy up the highly-sought after commodities. Australiaaposs Home Affairs Minister, Peter Dutton, has said that the government will come down like a ton of bricks on supermarket hoarders who have been clearing shelves of basic supplies. Speaking last month, he said that that anyone caught profiteering from buying up essential groceries such as food and toilet paper will be prosecuted. In the UK, police officers have taken to standing guard at supermarkets to halt coronavirus panic-buying and enforce the Governmentaposs social distancing orders.

season in the lower isions and dish out much-needed prize money.That was after the American’s initially-intended “no” vote changed to a “yes” to allow the resolution to pass in exchange for firm promises on league reconstruction five days later.That sparked an outcry from the club’s fans over the U-turn which saw Dundee United crowned Championship winners.And the Dundee Supporters Association – which is made up of  clubs comprising , members – sent an email to the Dens supremo asking for “clarity” over the change in position and how it would benefit the Dark Blues.Nelms responded with a club statement to reiterate he “got the best deal possible out of a situation that was going to be bad for us in any iteration proposed” and followed that up with a phone conversation with DSA chairman Kenny Ross.The DSA committee then released a statement stating they were pleased that the push for league reconstruction shows Nelms and owner Tim Keyes “are in this for the long haul”.The statement included: “We were pleased that the club not only released an updated statement later that day but that managing director John Nelms also personally contacted a member of the DSA committee by phone.“Mr Nelms was more than able to adequately explain the club’s thought processes and position and demonstrate how he was able to get the best possible outcome for Dundee Football Club in an impossible situation.“When Dundee realised their vote hadn’t been cast on April , the dynamic changed and it is clear to the DSA that Mr Nelms has worked tirelessly since and as a result of the SPFL releasing the results of the ballot before all of the member votes were in, was put in an unfair, undemocratic and dficult position.“With regards to league reconstruction we suspect that none of the  SPFL chairmanpushed harder for it than John Nelms and, as a result, a working party has been established to discuss it, which was not on the table in the original resolution.“It would not have been convened had Dundee voted ‘No’ as they had originally intended and this has to be a good thing and in the best interests of Dundee FC.“We were therefore pleased to learn that John himself will be on that working group and gives proof,any were needed that John and Tim Keyes are in this for the long haul.“The DSA are therefore happy and satisfied that Mr Nelms worked in best interests of both Dundee FC and Scottish football in general and got the best possible outcome for our club in a very dficult situation.“The Dundee FC Supporters Association has had a good working relationship with Mr Nelms and his board in recent years and we are grateful that he responded to our request swtly and satisfactorily and look forward to this relationship continuing in the future.”EXCLUSIVE: John Nelms answers fan worries saying #yes# vote got best possible deal for Dundee\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp exclusive-dundee-fans-want-answers-from-john-nelms-over-vote-u-turn embed # secretVsoNNDXU\" data-secret\"VsoNNDXU\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.33655221-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.33655221-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.33655221-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.33655221-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"lee wilkie dundee fc dundee united reconstruction spfl","story":"It’s great to see talks have already begun over league reconstruction and I’m glad they will be speedy ones – getting all this mess behind us will be for the better.Even a global pandemic can’t stop the drama that continually surrounds Scottish football.This past couple of weeks have taken the biscuit, though.I read Ann Budge’s comments recently about getting the plans in place as soon as possible and, for me, that’s the right idea.The quicker we get things sorted the better for everyone – clubs can plan ahead for whatever ision they will be in and there will, at last, be some clarity over what the future holds.Evenwe don’t know when the game will .I suggested a few weeks back that revamping our set-up to include  teams in the top flight would be a way to stop anyone being unfairly damaged by the coronavirus shutdown.I stand by that. In an ideal world I’d like to see an even bigger league with Dundee given the chance to join United in the Premiership.Whether that can happen, we’ll have to wait and see.We’re right at the start of the process so I’m sure almost anything is still on the table.I hope all the clubs in this area get something out of reconstruction. What we get should be better for Scottish football.I just hope we can avoid the same sort of voting farce we had  days ago with the SPFL.Dundee and managing director John Nelms were left in an impossible position, evensome of the behaviour has been questionable.As far as I’m concerned we should move on now and look to a better future. Ideally one with United and the Dark Blues in the top flight together.I know the existing Premiership clubs would certainly want the Dee up, too.What we know for sure, having seen the goings-on for the past couple of weeks, is clubs will only vote for something that is in their own interest. That’s just the way the world is.The good news, I think, for Dundee in all that is having them catapulted into the top flight would be seen to have plenty of plus points for it.Just ask Aberdeen – having both our city clubs back in the top flight gives them more decent away crowds coming to Pittodrie and their fans good away days.They wouldn’t be the only ones that benefit from having the Dundee derby back in the Premiership.We need the biggest teams at the top table – make it happen!It’s a few days ago now but I want to offer my congratulations to Robbie Neilson and his team after Dundee United were crowned Championship winners.The Tangerines have been in pole position right from the first whistle and it’s more than deserved for all at Tannadice.We don’t know what the top flight might look like come next season but the main objective has been achieved by Robbie – get United back in the big time.That’s been the target for four years now.It’s taken far longer than anyone associated with the club would have liked but they’ve finally done it.With all the noise going on over the past couple of weeks over the season, just having their top spot confirmed must be a huge weight off their shoulders.With the way the world is, relief will be the main feeling I’d bet for Robbie, Tony Asghar and Mark Ogren.They’ve done their bit – now it’s about improving the team for a shot at what is likely to be a bigger Premiership next campaign.Well done United!Having only seen the info that’s come out in the press, I’ve found Dundee United’s fall-out with a supporters’ group strange.It sounds like the money the Dundee United Supporters’ Foundation were looking to put into the club would be a benefit for everyone at Tannadice.There’s obviously been a disagreement behind the scenes but it doesn’t sit right with me having a go at your own fans – and on the day before the club were crowned champions, too.Jackie McNamara being up and about again was great to see last week. We were together in Scotland squads and he helped me a lot at that time. It’s fantastic to hear he’s on the mend again after a real health shock.🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

They weren#t.In the end, Bus made three starts, although he did find time to score an own goal against Inverness Caledonian Thistle # a performance then-EE columnist and club legend Stewart McKimmie described as #simply woeful#.Midfielder Fabiano made nine starts for the Dons in the   season under Ebbe Skovdahl and then Steve Paterson.The Frenchman had formerly been at PSG and Swansea before arriving at Pittodrie.Made similarly few appearances in the French lower leagues after his Reds spell.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

We have three dogs and three cats in foster that were in place before the lockdown. We are trying to support them as much as possible.\"Unfortunately, the lockdown means that we cannot re-home any animals at this time.

I can see this being a dficult year.\"If anything, we may see animals being handed in. People will misjudge and panic about the situation.

The burst of le and colour with the longevenings resurrects my mood, enlivens my nature-loving soul. It makes our days feel longer while also giving us the extra energy to enjoy them.How can we not be uplted by the sight of a tree in full blossom bathed in sparkling sunshine, or a carpet of wild flowers especially after months of winter when the land sleeps, and the sun seems to have forgotten us But these are not normal times of course and the ability to roam in nature and soak in its wonder has been temporarily restricted. In fact for many of us our normal le routine has been totally suspended.While we are in lockdown, nature is enjoying the opposite itrsquos flourishing with new le and beauty. And while itrsquos frustrating that we cannot venture out in ways we might be used to, I have been able to listen more closely to the stories that nature is telling on my doorstep.Over the last few years I have deliberately lsquore-wildedrsquo my small garden which I am so lucky to have. By that I mean I have allowed nature to do its thing, and nature has accepted the invitation. Elder, rowan, silver birch and cherry trees now enclose my wee patch of the world. Wild flowers such as dandelion and forget-me-nots have sprung up and last year I had foxglove, so Irsquom waiting to see what this summer will bring.A strange effect of all this has been the enlarging of my garden. Not literally, but in the power of its presence. Irsquove noticed how a space full of nature feels bigger than one thatrsquos bare, lsquoneatrsquo and manicured.I like to call it the forest horizon effect. Compare standing in the middle of a wide open treeless park with standing in the middle of a wood surrounded by trees and humming le. The area of the wood may be much smaller than the park, but its impact on our senses is much greater. We are embraced by nature, not just physically but also,we feel the connection, emotionally and spiritually. The space actually feels larger than it is because there is more in it.I am missing this embrace so much right now because of the inability to visit my favourite woods. But the lockdown has compelled me to spend more time in the natural world on my back doorstep.And within the embrace of my gardenrsquos re-wilded forest horizon, although only a space of around  metres by , I have discovered the truth contained in the wonderful book by Scott Sampson How to Raise a Wild Child.In his book, Scott states: ldquoWhen I began on this book, I had a certain sense of self-satisfaction, convinced that a letime of outdoor play, hiking and campinghellip had forged within me a deep bond with naturehellip Instead, I found that, like most of us, I was oblivious to most of the natural goings-on around me.He explains how he then spent time with his daughter absorbing the sounds and sights of nature on his doorstep, which fostered their lsquointernal wildnessrsquo more than any trip to a remote wilderness. They listened to birdsong and sat quietly as small creatures played out their lersquos dramas under the shadow of their house. ldquoWildness just outside the front door, Scott writes, ldquowas helping us deepen our bond with nature. Such interactions, I have come to realise, are essential to nature connection.Reading this has given new meaning to the confinement imposed by the lockdown. Never before have I had such time to simply sit and absorb the tiny goings on in the garden, embraced by my own mini forest horizon.A garden is a privilege, of course, and I understand many donrsquot have one. But wildness can also be found on our walk to the shops, on verges and public green spaces, with trees, bushes and wild flowers that grow in our urban spaces. The trick is to pause and absorb the wonder of it, listen and look for the wee miracles that we usually donrsquot notice and walk by. Itrsquos easier now, even on a normally busy street, with so much reduced traffic noise and absence of bustle.On my exercise walk yesterday I did just this and was overwhelmed by the beauty of renewed le. It occurred to me that this precious one-walk-a-day has intensied the connection it gives me to local nature.And never have I enjoyed the privilege of having a re-wilded garden so much. On Easter Monday I sat in it with my five-year-old son. His attention span can be short but I explained what we were doing and he stayed with me for  minutes. The first thing I noticed was the absence of normal background noise, which heightened the volume of naturersquos spring melody.Our garden attracts many birds which sit on the branches and sing their hearts out. I know they donrsquot sing for us, but my young son thought they were doing just that. In just  minutes we heard or saw coal tits, wrens, wood pigeons, willow warblers, magpies and a robin. Irsquod never have previously known what some of these birds were, but now we are in a mindset to get to know who is inhabiting our lsquodoorstep wildnessrsquo.We also watched a peacock butterfly explore our garden as it fluttered and paused in equal measure. The sound of bumblebees arrived and we saw them hover over the dandelions. Then a small honey bee made an entrance, likewise visiting the dandelions. As we sat quietly, the sound of honking above us raised our heads and we saw two V formations of geese heading north.When my boy got restless, I suggested we crawl like explorers in the grass to see what we could find. We spotted an incredible sight: young garden spiders emerging from their egg sack which was half hidden under a curve in a plant pot. My sonrsquos fascination at this was matched by my own! It was early for this to happen, and we found many other egg sacks where still unhatched.Within these  minutes there was so much le and wonder so many stories to discover. Where did the small birds come from, where were the geese going, why do bees suddenly appear and what did they do during the winter  Why are dandelions so popular with the bees, what is so special about them  Why do the birds sing dferently, are they speaking to each otherso, what are they saying How did the peacock butterfly get its name and where did it hibernate, was it in our garden shed  What was it looking for  Were the hatching spiders emerging early because their mother deliberately chose a warm corner in the garden to lay her eggs  Why do some spiders live in the garden, while others like hiding under your bed  Do you know how to spot the dference, and do they spin their webs dferently These were just some of the stories my son and I wondered about after our  minutes together in our garden wilderness. But such drama happens all around us. Little patches of mini wilderness are everywhere,we hone our senses to notice and appreciate them.I realise now the lockdown, although stressful, has created the conditions for the discovery of so many new things, with so many new nature stories to learn tales of survival and adventure, of lersquos drama happening on our doorstep and in our street.And the biggest story of all is that everything around us is ultimately related. We are part of naturersquos story because we are part of nature. We share a common ancestor with every creature and plant yes, even with the trees.So while I, like us all, yearn for the end of the lockdown for many reasons, I am also going to try to make the best of it by being more aware of naturersquos wonders that are literally outside my window, while I stay at home to help keep others safe."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-economy-braces-biggest-recession-300-years-due-lockdown---likely-recover","story":"While adjusting to le in isolation has been dficult, businesses have been hit particularly hard by the restrictions, with the budget watchdog now warning the country could suffer its biggest recession in  yearslockdown continues into the summer.The Office for Budget Responsibility has said the economy could shrink by  per cent this spring, with unemployment levels reaching . million over the coming months - its highest level since the s.The struggling economy has sparked comparisons to the financial crash in , and the Great Depression of the s, but experts are now predicting the outcome will be much worse.Experts now believe the UK is headed for its biggest economic slump since , when the country was hit by a deep freeze that spread across Europe.Temperatures plummeted on January , bringing with it the worst winter in  years and freezing over several countries, including France, England and Russia.The lsquoGreat Frostrsquo, as it came to be known, lasted for three months and sparked food shortages, thousands of deaths in France, and a huge deficit to the economy.The coronavirus pandemic could see the economy shrink by a record  per cent by June, the Office for Budget Responsibilityhas warned.A drop this big would mark the largest decline ldquoin living memory, Robert Chote, chairman of the OBR has said.However, Chancellor Rishi Sunak stressed that this forecast is just one possible scenario, and it merely suggests the scale of what the country is currently facing will have ldquoserious implications for our economy.He said: ldquoWe came into this crisis with a fundamentally sound economy, powered by the hard work and ingenuity of the British people and British businesses.ldquoOur planned economic response is protecting millions of jobs, businesses, self-employed people, charities and households.ldquoOur plan is the right plan.Mr Sunak assured that the government would not stand by and will act to support the economy, adding that the OBR expects the economic impact of the pandemic to be temporary.Despite being forecast for a signicant decline, the UK is expected toto its pre-coronavirus economic growth by the end of this year, with the OBR stating this amount will depend on how long the lockdown lasts.The OBR predicts that any drop in growth will be reversed in the three months to September, as the economy starts to recover.However, it warned that the pandemic may have a more lasting impact on unemployment, which is estimated to rise to . million by the end of June.Unemployment levels are currently . million, marking a rise from . per cent to  per cent.Unemployment rates are expected to remain high until , before dropping back to four per cent, according to the OBRrsquos forecast."},{"url":null,"title":"11-year-olds-thank-letter-delights-ambulance-staff","story":"Sarah Brady, , a primary seven pupil at Wallyford Primary School, was taking part in the first lsquoClap for our Carersrsquo event on March  with mum Samantha.She noticed the ambulance sitting at the end of her street so quickly drafted a letter and ran over with a rose and gave it to them.The letter read: ldquoThanks for everything yoursquore doing for the world, love Sarah Brady.Samantha said: ldquoThe clap was amazing.ldquoA few days later the ambulance had to come back to my house for my partner.ldquoThe ambulance lady said that two men were in Wallyford recently and someone gave them a letter and that they were really overwhelmed.

This coming Friday, at .pm on the dot, around  fans from all over the world will be logging in to join a virtual tasting by one of the greatest bottlers of them all ndash Adelphi.If you know whisky, that one world will have made you stop and take notice. If you donrsquot let me explain. Adelphi is like the Linn of hi-fi, the Aston Martin of motoring, the Gleneagles of hotels ndash basically,you see anything with that name on a bottle, you know yoursquore in for a serious treat.So why does a company like this need to get involved in virtual tastings  Surely they donrsquot need the money, or the publicity  Connal Mackenzie, group sales manager with the company, says the reason theyrsquore doing it is much more basic than that.ldquoThis is the only way we can get out to the Adelphi people, he says. ldquoIf it wasnrsquot for this virus, wersquod be gearing up for festivals.ldquoWe were going to be launching a new whisky list anyway, and we usually try to fall in to some kind of festival to do that, get feedback them and pour some drams for people.ldquoWe wanted to bottle up some samples and get them to the people who are missing out on festivals around the UK and further afield. This was the ideal  to do that.Interest in everything that Adelphi produces is usually huge, and new bottlings usually sell out very quickly, so it came as no surprise to me when Mackenzie told me that when the event was publicised, the tasting packs ndash five new expressions that will be tasted during Fridayrsquos session ndash sold out within  hours, with interest from as far afield as Australia and America.Mackenzie will be conducting the tasting, alongside Alex Bruce, managing director of Adelphi, and Arthur Motley, of Royal Mile Whiskies, which sells Adelphi whisky and has worked closely with them on Fridayrsquos event.But he is at pains to stress that the tasting is no exclusive event. ldquoA total of  people will have a tasting pack ndash however, this is not just for those people. Yes, the tasting pack will be part of the discussion, but there will be plenty of people around the world who have bottles of Adelphi open ndash or any whisky for that matter ndash and we want them to join us.ldquoAlex, Arthur and myself will be just having a general chat about whisky ndash yes, the focus will be on our whiskies ndash but we want to invite anyone whorsquos a fan to open a bottle and join us.So, to the critical question ndash whatrsquos going to be on show  Irsquom speaking to Mackenzie by phone, but I can almost see the glint of excitement in his eyes. ldquoWersquore pretty pleased with this list ndash and we hope the people who join us will be too hellipSo here are the drams:bull Ardnamurchan   Year Old Single Cask .% not- this is a bottling from Adelphirsquos own distillery, and the first taste of the actual whisky ahead of an release hopefully later this year.bull The Glover  Year Old Batch  .% not- a special mix of Ardnamurchan and whisky from the legendary Chichibu Distillery in Japan.bull Linkwood   Year Old Single Cask .%bull Caol Ila   Year Old Single Cask .%And just for a special treat:bull Bas Armagnac   Year Old Armagnac Single Cask .%So, how can I get involved, I ask Connal. ldquoWell, he said, ldquoeven though all our tasting packs have sold out, donrsquot let that bother you. Just log on to one of our social media channels, open your favourite dram and join the discussion.Irsquom not sure I can think of a better way to spend a Friday night!If you want to join in, go to one of the following at .pm on Friday, April :https:www.facebook adelphihttps:www.instagram adelphi https:www.youtube channel UCHWysRZyIuYotSvy-KQ"},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Iain Macwhirter  Face it  the age of free movement is over as Covid leads to hard borders","story":"Donald Trump closed the US borders yesterday to all immigrants in a tweet that was widely criticised as ldquoxenophobic and racist ndash an attempt to cover his own incompetence. Yet caring, sharing Jacinda Ardern has done exactly the same in New Zealand. No foreigners have been permitted to enter since the Antipodean country the lockdown.Nor is there any certainty that New Zealandrsquos borders are going to reopen any time soon. At the very least, future immigrants will have to put up with quarantine and long delaysthey are allowed into the country at all. Itrsquos a Brexiterrsquos wet dream.In Scotland, the Government is under pressure to explain why, as The Herald reported recently, , people have been allowed to enter the country apparently with barely any health checks at all. This seems to be a UK policy. Border controls are not devolved, and the UK Government seems to want to keep airports open for business.SNP MSPs and MPs are also talking about closing Scotlandrsquos border. MP Joanna Cherry has demanded, at the very least, rigorous health checks and quarantine at airports. Commentators, like our own Neil Mackay, are calling on Nicola Sturgeon to detach Scotland from the failing Westminster Government and introduce a rigorous independent policy of test, track and trace following Germanyrsquos lead.You only need to look at what is happening in Singapore to understand why voters are concerned about the UKrsquos laissez-faire approach to border security. This scrupulously tidy city state had been the poster child for Covid management. Thanks to its experience of SARS a decade ago it was well prepared.The lockdown was rapid and the country adopted mass testing and contact tracing from the start. By the beginning of April, Singapore seemed to be well on top of he disease. Then came the second wave.On Monday, Singapore recorded more than , new cases of Covid , its highest ever. The country of five million people now leads south-east Asia in the virulence of this disease.And who are they blaming  Well, the one million migrant workers, from countries like Bangladesh, who sweep the city streets and tend its butterfly gardens. The most virulent new outbreak is in their cramped dormitories.The Singapore authorities have quarantined thousands of migrant workers into what are to all intents and purposes Covid concentration camps. Eye witnesses report squalid conditions, rats and poor food.Now, New Zealand is one of the most liberal and open societies in the world. But it is going to allow migrants to enter the country freely any time soon  Is it going to allow the four million or so annual tourists  My daughter is one of them. Shersquos been in a Queenstown backpackers hostel under lockdown for the last month.The ethnic dimension to Covid is going to be a huge issue in the near future. Itrsquos already clear that BAME people are more prone to getting this disease. That may be genetic, or it may be to do with their social circumstances and over-crowding. But it means that, in authoritarian countries, they risk being singled out for epidemiological social cleansing.Covid is changing the world in dramatic and disturbing ways. We are seeing a big increase in economic nationalism. The European Union has been riven with tension over Germanyrsquos reluctance to share the Covid-related debts of Italy.Global companies are suffering billions in losses from the disruption of international trade and are repatriating supply chains. This re-shoring, as it is known, had already been happening before Covid, as wages have risen in China, making manufacturing there less attractive.Apple canrsquot market its new phones because of disruption to factories in China. It canrsquot rely on foreign sweatshop labour any more because the sweatshops are going to be transformed to combat the disease.But the pandemic has added yet another dimension to it. There is huge uncertainty about when andborders will relax. It is beginning to look aswe may have economic disruption until a vaccine is found, and even after that.This is why Mr Trumprsquos much-criticised travel ban makes a great deal of sense from his nationalistic, America First, politics. The Presidentrsquos Twitter rants seem arbitrary, contradictory, callous and unthinking. And they are. But they are also politically astute.The Democrats have got themselves into a mess by attacking Mr Trumprsquos border closures. They accused him of racism when he banned flights from the European Union back in February. And again today. But his voters only see him following the example of other countries.America is a vast country, with a erse economy providing most of what it needs from corn to cars. It could effectively shut the world out. Indeed, the US is arguably much better placed to do that than New Zealand because it can do without many of the imports other more open countries depend on.Here, SNP supporters argue that, since Scotlandrsquos death rate is currently running at around half of Englandrsquos, Ms Sturgeon should be following Jacinda Ardern and locking the border. There is immense frustration that Nicola Sturgeon appears to be dictated to by the UK Government.Health is devolved and the Scottish NHS could have pursued a dferent policy. However, as this column has repeatedly pointed out, the Scottish Government is following the same scientic advice as England. There is no evidence that Ms Sturgeon would have followed a dferent course had Scotland been independent.But social media is echoing to demands to lock foreigners out of Scotland for safetyrsquos sake. Ms Sturgeon is an internationalist and will never do that. But the resurgence of nationalism across the world is making borders ever more important to voters.

Up until then, the UK Government had given out very mixed messages. It allowed international sports fixtures to go ahead, allowing , fans from virus-hit Madrid to come to watch Liverpool play on March . It allowed racingrsquos Cheltenham Festival to go ahead from March -. It stopped contact tracing on March  with no apparent strategy to replace it.Between March  and , the hospital death rates were doubling every two-to three days. On March , Boris Johnson gave a speech which advised people to socially distance and not go to pubs and restaurants. Schools remained open. Although a section of the community took this advice, public transport was still very crowded, people were still going out, and on the following weekend, we saw thousands of people flocking to beauty spots across the country. Obviously the message that Mr Johnson had given was not understood and did not have the intended effect and transmission was still occurring to a great extent.Finally, on March , the present lockdown was announced. If this had been done a week previously, as in Germany, Austria and other places, our death and infection rates would be up to a quarter of those at present. With a doubling rate of three days, simple mathematics shows that in a week, the infections will quadruple. If the present lockdown had been announced a week earlier, a lot of our present problems would not be as great. There would be less need for PPE, intensive care beds and mortuaries. The lockdown would not be required as long as the virus would not have infected as much of the community. The economy would perhaps be less affected.A few weeks ago Professor Jason Leitch was talking about achieving herd immunity in an interview on BBC Scotland. Todayit has been reported that the WHO estimates only two to three per cent of the population is infected. It has also been suggested that having had Covid- does not guarantee immunity. This should hopefully stop any suggestion that we should allow successive waves of infection until we build up herd immunity.The Scottish Government needs to organise testing in the community and contact tracing so that we can ease the lockdown and keep the virus under control. The suggestion that this could start off in the more easily-isolated areas of the country seems a good idea. The Scottish Government should not be waiting for a ided, leaderless UK Government Cabinet to make a decision.Rob Evans, Dundee DD.IT is vital that the Scottish Government follows the advice from Neil Mackay. Health issues are devolved to the Scottish Government andNicola Sturgeon is unable to draw up regulations appropriate for the conditions which pertain in Scotland then that does call into question how Scotland could operate as an independent country. The Scottish Government must show that it is capable of governing the country in a distinct and appropriate manner.The regulations in all four home countries appear to have been cut and pasted from the same source. As an initial response that was quite acceptable, especiallythe source document has originally come from the World Health Organisation or the regulations imposed in another European country. However, now that the regulations have been in force for a month the four home countries need to develop their own regulations. The lower population density in Scotland presents both opportunities and challenges. The easy option is to follow Boris Johnson and then claim a big boy did it and ran away.Sandy Gemmill, Edinburgh EH.NEIL Mackay has deemed Boris Johnsonrsquos approach to the coronavirus pandemic as a ldquodisaster and has urged Nicola Sturgeon to ldquobreak away. Ms Sturgeon has been at pains to stay more or less aligned to the Westminster approach, so far, which is to her credit, but deviation can only be sensiblethe course ahead is definite.All politicians will make mistakes over this new and uncharted coronavirus outbreak, it is inevitable, and sadly lives are always subject to such political judgments. At this stage no one can be sure about most of the answers but what is terribly obvious is that this whole episode has exposed the fragilities of Scottish independence. Just look at the oil price situation for example, hence Ms Sturgeonrsquos desire not to be out on a limb for fear of it breaking, and rightly so. It will not please some nationalists but we are definitely better together at this point in time and our First Minister seems to be aware of this fact.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow G.IT is almost impossible to try to make sense of Neil Mackayrsquos article in a non-political perspective. First, no one can at this stage know what the result of the UK Government strategy will be. His criticism based on personalities is hardly factual. The main thrust of his argument that the Scottish Government should take a dferent approach is confusing, as there has been nothing to stop it doing so up to now presumably it believes the UKrsquos approach to be correct. Mr Mackay now needs to inform us in detail what detailed steps we should take in Scotland that are dferent.Colin McKay, Newton Stewart.THE UK Government has been on the receiving end of criticism from people and organisations across the political spectrum for its handling of some of the UK manestations of the Covid- pandemic.In particular, when the decision was announced in the last week or so in March, that the country would enter a period of lockdown which brought the economic le of the country to a juddering halt, there was comment that this action should have been taken seven,  or even more days earlier, and perhaps it should have. However, I wonderthe decision to postpone the onset of lockdown was made for very pragmatic reasons.Scroll back six or seven weeks or so, and we were being regaled on an almost daily basis in both print and broadcast media of y queues of people with trolleys waiting for supermarkets to open, and some time later, leaving these emporiums with trolleys stacked high with toilet rolls, kitchen paper, rice, pasta, part-baked bread rolls and other non-perishable goods, stripping the shelves bare in the process.Despite repeated pleas from civic, political and religious leaders, and the supermarket chains themselves, this activity continued for many days. I would imagine that, when introducing a new policy, particularly one which imposes considerable new restrictions, ministers and their advisors would consider what would be the likelihood of the target population co-operating with these new impositions, andimprobable, what scale of resources and expenditure would be required to compel and maintain their compliance.Given the response to the appeal for shoppers to revert to the pattern of purchasing that they had found perfectly adequate in the last week of January, the Government probably felt that it would have little chance of persuading the general population to accept much more drastic restrictions, at least until it had been persistently exposed to the carnage taking place in Italy and Spain. Even then, there were a signicant number of so-called Covidiots who seemed intent on defying any attempt to curb their liberty.Christopher W Ide, Waterfoot.THE language of war and battles to fight the coronavirus must stop.Language is a powerful tool. It can be used to both praise and demonise but either way it has an effect of on people, their wellbeing, their mental health. However, just as important as the adverse or positive effect that language can have on us as iniduals, words are also capable of shaping the public narrative to convince us what to think. Using war language to fight a health crisis is not helpful for at least three main reasons.The first is that it undermines legitimate challenge which, when it is absent, encourages systemic negligence to run rampantly unchecked.Secondly, it lulls us to uncritically accept the inevitability of thousands upon thousands of deaths, especially enabling the expendability of the costly, most vulnerable people in our society.Thirdly, war language demands sacrice and a culture of silence. This expectation is unnecessary, unwanted, and unhelpful it is anti-democratic and smacks of political expediency.All of these impacts are worrying and serves only as power and compliance tools for our political governors. Frontliners are workers, consistently undervalued ones, granted, but they are not warriors and they deserve the best protection. In light of this, more, many more questions need to be asked and answered.Why were we not prepared for this  Why are so many people dying compared to countries like Germany  Why are so many people dying in our care homes  Why are we demanding that our friends and family work on the frontline without full and proper protection for themselves and their patients  Why is there no urgency or recognition of the need to test and track Finally, in this modern Scotland, is it too much to ask to be treated like adults and receive honest answers in this bumbling, post-truth political world Councillor Brian McGinley , Ayr.I AM one of those people who go out every Thursday at pm to say thank you to all those dedicated people who are putting their lives and those of their families at risk to save others. I am, however, disappointed that the only references made regarding the Police Service are of issuing fines and heavy-handed tactics in dealing with the public in these dficult times.Their job is dficult enough and there is always a fine balance between discretion and enforcement. So on Thursday I will be including the police in my tribute to the emergency services.Neil Stewart, Balfron.News from trusted and credible sources is essential at all times, but especially now as the coronavirus pandemic impacts on all aspects of our lives.

There they sat in the Commons chamber, the carpet marked with black and yellow hazard tape as a guide to social distancing. Benches blocked off with plywood. Parliament looking even more like one giant building site.The Scottish Parliament, modern and therefore more adaptable, was slightly smarter when it ed on Tuesday after recess. Fty seats had been removed from the chamber, making the place look even airier.At Westminster yesterday the first virtual Prime Ministerrsquos Questions, or VPMQsyou must, took place. With the PM convalescing at Chequers, the new Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer making his debut, and the leader of the SNP in the Commons beaming in from his constituency of Ross, Skye and Lochaber, it was a dear diary day.: Government criticised for being slow to actSir Keir and Dominic Raab, First Secretary of State and Foreign Secretary, standing in for Boris Johnson, began by jabbing politely at each other like the lawyers they are. The Labour leader asked about the Governmentrsquos continuing failure to get anywhere near its own target of , tests a day. Mr Raab tried to turn the focus on the number of tests that could be done, rather than how many were being carried out. Sir Keir, thinking on his feet, picked up on this and came right back at the First Secretary of State. Just for a second, Mr Raab looked rattled.This was the cut and thrust of parliamentary democracy as it should be. Sir Keir also managed to secure that all-important sound bite for social media, in this case about the Government being ldquoslow into lockdown, slow on testing, slow on protective equipment.There were obvious problems, the lack of atmosphere most of all. The place was almost as empty as the average high street. Technical glitches occurred. ldquoDavid Mundell wersquove been unable to connect, announced the Speaker in sombre tones. Was the computer switched on, Mr M  Conservative MP Peter Bone was cut off midway through a rant on banks. SNP leader Ian Blackford used the occasion to punt the idea of a universal basic income perhaps not the most pressing concern of the day.Sir Keir missed a trick in not asking the Foreign Secretary about the UKrsquos involvement, or lack of it, in EU schemes to procure ventilators and protective equipment.: Building industry calls for supportIt was a Foreign Office official, after all, who told a Commons committee it had been a ldquopolitical decision not to take part, though he later said there had been a misunderstanding. Too messy for Sir Keir to raise, or did it not fit in with his ldquoconstructive opposition approach PMQs were a little rough round the edges, then, but it will get better. The crucial thing is that MPs and MSPs are back at work. They have been missed. Recent months have been a stress test for democracy as much as they have been for the operation of the NHS. Cracks have begun to show, and nowhere more so than in holding government to account.But we have the daily pm briefings at Number , do we not  No Scottish Six, but here is your Downing Street Five. To think the British press used to envy their American counterparts and the daily White House briefings on camera. So much more accountability and transparency. If only we could have our very own CJ Cregg from the West Wing instead of an anonymous bod who goes by the name of ldquoa Downing Street spokesperson.Except it has not worked out like that. The White House pressers are still going strong, and in their own way are providing a vital insight into a presidency. Americans are at once enthralled and appalled by their commander-in-chief.Back in Downing Street, meanwhile, we continue to slog through the motions of the  orsquoclock briefing. Up pops the Minister of the day followed by the experts. After the now ritual statement and reading of the graphs we switch to the screen for journalists to ask questions that are routinely swerved.Much of the problem is caused by journalists not being in the room. As any interviewer will tell you, there is a world of dference between talking to someone in person, and speaking to them at one remove.: Charity demands actionIn person you can look them in the eye, read their responses, adapt the questioning. An interview conducted via video call is almost as bad as one by phone ndash worse, possibly, because landlines tend not to have technical hitches.If it is possible for people to be in the same place in the Commons, at Holyrood, and in the White House briefing room, why canrsquot a small band of journalists take it in turns to attend the Downing Street press conference in person Politicians have a particular and crucial role to play when it comes to holding the executive to account. It is easy to sneer at your average backbencher or committee. What do they do all day  Why do they take so long to produce a report  How much more effective, as we saw during Brexit, to go through the courtsyou want something done.Yet the courts are not plugged into the community in the same way as politicians. MPs and MSPs see and hear what is happening on the ground, and in some instances they are better placed to get answers. Their role as advocates will become even more important as the months go by and le becomes harder for people. Many citizens are going to be coming into contact with the state as never before, and they will need help from those who know their way around.From the expenses scandal to Brexit, recent decades have not been the best of times for politicians. Now they have a chance to redeem themselves.There is a sense of drt in the country at the moment. People are stunned. Fearful of what is coming next. While no-one has all the answers it is time to start asking more questions with greater urgency, and politicians have a front line role to play in that.

The results will help scientists and the Government in the ongoing response to the coronavirus outbreak, with initial findings expected to be available in early May.Led by the Department for Health and Social Care and the Office for National Statistics, the study will draw on the world-leading scientic expertise of the University of Oxford, backed by the proven testing capabilities of data science company IQVIA UK and the National Biosample Centre in Milton Keynes. No cost of the study has so far been given.ldquoUnderstanding more about the rate of Covid- infection in the general population and the longer term prevalence of antibodies is a vital part of our ongoing response to this virus, said Matt Hancock, the UK Health Secretary.ldquoThis survey will help to track the current extent of transmission and infection in the UK while also answering crucial questions about immunity as we continue to build up our understanding of this new virus.ldquoTogether, these results will help us better understand the spread of the virus to date, predict the future trajectory and inform future action we take, including crucially the development of ground-breaking new tests and treatments, he added.Participants will provide samples taken from self-administered nose and throat swabs and answer a few short questions during a home visit by a trained health worker. The swab tests will show whether or not participants currently have the virus. They will be asked to take further tests every week for the first five weeks, then every month for  months.In total, , thousand people will take part in the pilot phase of the survey with plans to extend it to up to around , over the next  months across the whole of the UK.Adults from around , households will also provide a blood sample taken by a trained nurse, phlebotomist or healthcare assistant. These tests will help determine what proportion of the population has developed antibodies to Covid-. Participants will be asked to give further samples monthly for the next  months.Swabs will be taken from all participating households, whether their members are reporting symptoms or not. Blood will not be taken in any households where someone has symptoms of Covid- or is currently self-isolating or shielding.The trained study health workers will use all the recommended precautions to protect themselves and everyone in the household from getting the virus. Swab test results will be communicated back to participants by their GPs and confidentiality will be protected throughout the process.Sir Ian Diamond, the National Statistician, said: ldquoThe Office for National Statistics has huge experience in running very large household surveys that gather vital information from a genuinely representative sample of the entire population.

Relative A will say something like, lsquoWell, of course, I donrsquot believe anything they say.rsquoWersquove been having these conversations since lockdown began. The first time it happened, I asked, lsquoWhat do you mean  Who donrsquot you believe rsquoThen they told me. They didnrsquot believe the virus was real ndash andit was real, then the Governmentwas letting it spin out of control in order to cull the population and reorder society. Perhaps it was cooked up in some military lab and released on purpose. Perhaps any vaccine will be microchipped to monitor us. Perhaps itrsquos all a step towards dictatorship, a ruse to lock us in our homes, controlled, regimented, our freedoms taken away.lsquoTheyrsquore trying to kill us. Theyrsquore turning this country into ,rsquo Relative A said. My relation even believed lsquocrisis actorsrsquo were used to pose as the dead.At first I argued rationally. Irsquod quote news reports or scientic studies. But mainstream media and science are apparently in on it too. I havenrsquot yet hazarded the question whether Irsquom part of the global conspiracy given Irsquom a journalist.Rationality failed, so next came gentle mockery. lsquoCrsquomon, yoursquod have to be nuts to believe this,rsquo Irsquod say. lsquoOnly crackpots on the internet think like this.rsquoThen I got another shock. lsquoWell,rsquo said Relative A. lsquoRelative B thinks like me too.rsquoSo I donrsquot just have one coronavirus conspiracy theorist among my loved ones. I have two. Irsquom getting worried about family genes.Relative B is even worse than Relative A. While Relative A just lives in some paranoid fantasy land, Relative B has gone full-blown tinfoil hat. According to Relative Bcoronavirus is a plot by the Illuminati ndash thatrsquos the cabal of lizard people, who disguise themselves as humans, and run the world for their own evil purposes. The Queen is one, in case you didnrsquot know. Sorsquos Tom Hanks.Let me tell you a little about these relatives. Theyrsquore good people. I love them ndash theyrsquore family. Irsquom more in contact with Relative A than Relative B. Relative A is a woman in her late s. Hard-working, intelligent, good-hearted, takes no nonsense. Shersquos been politically switched on her whole le. Relative B is in his late s, a bit of a slacker, a bit of a lad and no bookworm. He couldnrsquot give a damn about politics. Two more dferent people yoursquore unlikely to meet. When Irsquove seen them together at family events, Relative A and Relative B have tended not to agree on much hellip until now.What my relatives believe is absurd, ridiculous, embarrassing ndash butyoursquove people like this in your familyyoursquoll know itrsquos not funny at all. I fear for my relatives. If they donrsquot believe whatrsquos happening is truly happening,they doubt science and fact, then theyrsquoll put themselves at risk. And both of them are putting themselves at risk.Relative A isnrsquot keeping to social distancing. lsquoNo-one will take my rights away,rsquo she says. Nor is Relative B. Hersquos already been stopped and questioned by police. Both of them have physical contact with other relatives ndash who I also love ndash and I fear their behaviour could be deadly to themselves or others.Last week, I just stopped the conversation in its tracks when Relative A started her conspiracy theories. It disturbed me too much to even listen to what she had to say. lsquoLetrsquos change the subject,rsquo I said.Yesterday, though, I tried a dferent tack when I called Relative A. Irsquod been speaking to other family members and we were all worried about her ideas and behaviour. I should stress therersquos no mental health issues with either Relative A or Relative B. As far as my extended family knows theyrsquore sane and sound of mind ndash eventhey are both bizarrely enabling each other.Instead of rationality, or mockery, or dismissal, I just asked questions. Why do you feel this  What makes you believe that  How can this be the case What I discovered was that my relativersquos delusions were down to plain old fear and confusion. For her, nothing adds up. One day the Government says X, the next it says Y. One day the advice is do this, the next itrsquos do that. Businesses must reopen. Schools must stay shut. Wersquoll ease the lockdown. The lockdown will go on. We must test ndash but wherersquos the tests  We must trace ndash wherersquos the tracing  Wherersquos the safety gear  Police and scientists tell us to obey the rules then they flout the rules. Everythings wrong and broken.Relative A said: lsquoYou canrsquot believe a word they say. Nobody can be this incompetent while people are dying. Itrsquos the same everywhere in the world. If this was genuine they wouldnrsquot be frittering lives away.rsquoThen I understood. Where I see governmental stupidity, and the weakness and folly of flawed humans trying to control a global meltdown, my relative sees malignant conspiracy. We look at the same failures but see them through very dferent lenses.In a way, our governments are driving us all mad. Their pretence that they know what theyrsquore doing, their inconsistency, their dissembling, their cowardice, are all having a detrimental effect on the mental health of the world ndash as ordinary people tackle this crisis better than those elected to lead us.For some, though, like Relative A and Relative B, government duplicity and failure arenrsquot just a drain on hope and joy, theyrsquore a shattering of reality ndash and for that I feel nothing but the deepest sympathy for the people I love who are now a little lost inside this world wersquove come to live in, and are struggling desperately to understand whatrsquos happening.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the YearOur columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Irsquove spoken to one or two of them and, while some are more cautious than others, many believe they could safely re-open now and common sense says theyrsquore right.Garden centres, for example. I spoke to Adam McGowan, the general manager of McLarenrsquos Nurseries near Barrhead, and he told me a bit about how theyrsquove been affected by the crisis. The staff at the nursery spend years nurturing their stock, but under lockdown some plants have had to be dumped, others may not survive much longer, and anyone whorsquos a gardener will know how that feels. Itrsquos gutting, says Adam.The business model has also come under huge pressure. McLarenrsquos are still taking some orders over the phone while the nursery itself is closed to the public, and their drivers are doing  to  drops a day. But therersquos no way deliveries can replace the business they would have had: there are lots of customers who canrsquot get what they want and the business is losing potential profit.The thing is: therersquos no reason for it to go on like this. McLarenrsquos, and other businesses like it, could re-open tomorrow. Indeed, a handful of bigger BQs have reopened with social distancing in place.Therersquos plenty of space at the McLarenrsquos site ndash more than  acres ndash but even smaller garden centres usually have plenty of space and big aisles. They could also, as supermarkets have done, introduce a one-way system and put up signs to remind people of social distancing.Following the same principles, there are other businesses that could open right away: DIY stores, bike shops, car dealers, even museums and book shops, provided of course they had an upper limit on customers. Not only would it apply a couple of spark plugs to the economy, it would be good for the mental wellbeing of the people stuck at home % of the time. And, although it might seem counter-intuitive, allowing people to go out to buy plants and DIY supplies would also encourage them to stay at home more by giving them things to do while theyrsquore there.Not every business thinks this way, of course. I spoke to the owner of the hardware store, Timbermills in Cumnock, and he was cautious about re-opening. Like everyone , hersquos lost trade, but he thinks re-opening too soon would end up costing more money in safety measures, PPE equipment for staff, and so on. Hersquos also concerned customers coming back to the shop might lead to another spike in the virus, another lockdown and an even bigger hit to profits.Then there are the businesses who feel that even being allowed to re-open would not help at this stage. Shaun Bythell, who owns The Bookshop in Wigtown, has seen positive signs in other countries ndash in Italy and Austria bookshops and garden centres were among the first to reopen. But he says the majority of his customers are retired, which means theyrsquod be self-isolating anyway evenhe did re-open.And it doesnrsquot end there: therersquos the added worry that the moment restrictions are lted, Shaunrsquos business would no longer be eligible for government assistance ndash not that hersquos received a penny so far. As for his assessment of the future of the bookshop, itrsquos suitably literary ndash he is, he says, ldquoin blood stepped in so far, ing were as tedious as go orsquoer. Macbeth, Act , Scene .Listening to Shaun talk about his experiences isnrsquot easy, but other businesses that do feel that they could reopen safely should be allowed to do so. Adam at McLarenrsquos told me the nursery could reopen tomorrow and do it safely and he believes the vast majority of garden centres are in the same situation.So let them do it, and the shovers, draggers and nudgers will do their thing. The shovers will push the limits but will be forced to obey the rules on social distancing. The draggers will stay at home for quite a bit longer. And the nudgers will get out and start shopping and feeling normal again. The point is that we cannot stay like this for much longer. We need the first relaxation, the first let-up, the first nudge.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Within Scotland there are, after all, wide iations, for example National Records Scotland reports that, up till April  NHS Grampian, population ,, had  Covid- deaths, or  per million, and Greater Glasgow and Clyde, population .m, , or  per million, almost three times as many and nearer Londonrsquos  per million.Similar wide iations occur across the UK, so I can understand Nicola Sturgeon and the UK Government considering dfering approaches on lockdown and resourcing that are regional or situation based, but why Scotland vs rUK What astounds me is the attempts to blame it all on politicians, and UK politicians at that. Undoubtedly there have been screw-ups, but little is made of the Herculean efforts to build the Nightingale hospitals, including one in Glasgow that will probably not be needed, arguably because the politiciansrsquo, expertsrsquo and NHS strategies and efforts are working.On Channel  last night , Professor Dame Anne Glover, the Glasgow-based former scientic adviser to the EU, opined that experts had been advising on the basis that this was a flu epidemic, did not advise lockdown earlier than it was carried out, and did not strongly propose mass testing.Tellingly, she said it is the expertsrsquo job to advise the politicians, but that politicians do not always want to hear. But in the case of Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon they have by and large been following a strategy based on their expertsrsquo advice.Who can imagine either leader attempting to force us into a lockdown that the estimable Jason Leitch, for example, said wasnrsquot yet required, and in the face of public and press outrage Allan Sutherland, Stonehaven.HAVING watched the excruciating performance of UK Heath Secretary Matt Hancock on Tuesday eveningrsquos Downing Street briefing, I feel that I must agree wholeheartedly with the views expressed in Neil Mackayrsquos article .Surely the present UK Cabinet must be one of the most incompetent on record. Despite the Tory Party being in government now for some  years it is utterly depressing that the leadership of the UK is so manestly weak. It is tragic that a time of such national crisis we look in vain for Government ministers who can at least give a much-better impression that they know what they are doing. Instead the last few weeks have been characterised by missed opportunities, strategic mistakes, confusion, a failure to learn from the experience of others and a chronic inability to be honest with the public. I would absolve the Scottish Government from this criticism. Of course there have been mistakes and problems, but at least they are being tackled with an honesty and transparency sadly lacking where.What a contrast with New Zealand. In todays edition you quote Helen Petousis-Harris, a vaccine expert at the University of Aucklandwho very succinctly summarises the misery being endured in the UK. ldquoThe countryhas managed to avoid the confusion and half-measures that had hampered the response in many other placeshellipNew Zealand got everything righthellipdecisive action, with strong leadership and very clear communications to everybody. What a contrast with Westminster.A glance at the membership of Boris Johnsonrsquos Cabinet helps explain why the UK is in such a dreadful situation with a shockingly high death rate. Mr Johnson has surrounded himself with a team of sycophantic young Brexiters with virtually no track record of successful ministerial responsibility. His vindictiveness on taking office has seen most of the Tories of experience and ability such as Jeremy Hunt, languishing on the back benches or, like Dominic Grieve, driven out of politics altogether. It is not decisive leadership on the part of the UK Government that is pulling us through. Rather it is the hard work, dedication and sacrices of the devoted members of our NHS together with all those others support and care workers who are doing their best at great risk to their safety and emotional well-being.Eric Melvin, Edinburgh EH.I WOULD have thought thatthe Tory Party had any real sense of duty to the British public it would have invited the experienced Theresa May back into power as acting PM while Boris Johnson is hors de combat. I doubt, however, she would accept, having been stabbed in the back by the very same people.The one good thing about the Covid- pandemic is that for the generation to come at least, the records of the time-line from the initial whistleblowing of Dr Li Wenliang until we find ourselves back to normality will be embedded in their psyche. We will not, I pray, have to require drills and exercises between pandemics, as next time we will be fully prepared. Wonrsquot we What will be the date we stop clapping frontline staff every Thursday evening  I understand that Mr Johnson likes to quote the ancient Greek historian Thucydides. He would be better referring to Bertolt Brecht, who said: ldquoUnhappy the land that is in need of heroes. Thank goodness we still have so many ordinary people who can become valiant and heroic. The ordinary people of the UK have shone while our leaders have proved wanting.It is, however, a lesson in preparedness that only  years after the signing of the Treaty of Versailles to formally end the ldquowar to end wars we were at war with Germany yet again. It is within the grasp of humanity to learn nothing.Questions have to be asked, therefore,the World Health Organisation has the power and capacity to effectively force the containment of another such viral outbreak to within its own zone  Perhaps there is the need for a newly-drafted international health treaty with robust penalties on all nations where they fail to act decisively and swtly.Bill Brown, Milngavie.Martin Redfern, Edinburgh EH.IT is clear that this country will be facing immense economic and social challenges throughout the years ahead. There is already a widespread recognition that much has to be done in order to restore public expenditure to a level appropriate for any enlightened country. For instance, no longer must those essential workers we celebrate each Thursday evening be refused decent levels of remuneration. No longer can we be indferent to the consequences of  years of austere Conservatism for those at the margins of society referred to by David J Crawford in his letter of  April.There needs to be a debate on the redistribution required to create a far less unequal society. That means that those of us who are in receipt of generous salaries and pensions must face up to the consequences for us of any such redistribution. This is not only a matter of sourcing the resources needed. It is a matter of demonstrating that we, the more fortunate, must admit that our relative prosperity is dficult to justy while child poverty, being one example among so many, is such a scandal.I quote the recent words of the Bishop of Kensington. We must ldquolearn the capacity to sacrice our own desires for the sake of the wider community, recognising that ldquomaybe coronavirus is giving us a crash course in a dferent moral universe ndash one that might just be the saving of us.John Milne, Uddingston.I WORK in construction in England and have done for four years due to the lack of work in Scotland: in England and Wales with the exception of TFL Projects in London, all construction work is still ongoing, builders merchants and manufacturing companies which closed initially have all now re-opened and operating sites have re-written their safe systems of work to ensure they are working safely within the Governments guidelines on social distancing, as is the case in Europe in Spain, Germany and Sweden as an example.In Scotland this industry is currently at a standstill unless it is essential work the construction of the Louisa Jordan hospital is one example. How come this pound million project was delivered safely while all other construction work in Scotland is on lockdown A lot of construction work can be achieved with simple social distancing measure Ts. so why is the Scottish Government not looking to give this industry the same advice and support issued by the UK Government his would be one industry that could start to support the Scottish economy immediately as well as many of the self employed who will not benefit from the UK Governments wages support schemes. The last thing the Scottish workforce needs now is further contraction of an already seriously diminished market.On whose advice is the First Minister basing her Governments guidance when the industry is operating normally everywhere  John McWilliams, Coatbridge.THERE appears to be growing unease in some countries about the part played by the Chinese government in allowing the initial spread of coronavirus.The US state of Missouri is suing the Chinese government for \"lying to the worldrsquorsquo and \"silencing whistle-blowers\". The Chinese Embassy in Australia has accused Aussie politicians of joining in US orchestrated anti-Chinese rhetoric.The last thing the world needs at the moment is a witch hunt and blame-pinning exercise, but anyone following events from the start would, I am sure, agree that the Chinese authorities have at the very least serious questions to answer.At the end of the present nightmare, a thorough investigation is needed and lessons learned.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh EH.News from trusted and credible sources is essential at all times, but especially now as the coronavirus pandemic impacts on all aspects of our lives.

We cannot afford to have exceptions.\"Each one of us will have to adapt to this as the new normal, at least until we are sure that we can be more protected by a vaccine or treatment.\"If, after easing any restrictions, the evidence tells us we are unable to contain the transmission of the virus then we will have to re-impose them, possibly ing to lockdown with little notice.\"While we will do our best to avoid this, it is possible that such a cycle may happen more than once until we reach a point when we have in place an effective vaccine.\"The document warns easing restrictions will not mean ing to how things were before the virus.It says ministers will take \"distinctive decisions for Scotlandthe evidence tells us that is necessary\".Options for ying the restrictions include full and partial lting of existing measures.Variations by geography, by sector, or by specic groups of the population could also be introduced.Ms Sturgeon said the number of people in Scotland who have died after testing positive for the virus is ,, up by  from , on Wednesday. A total of , people have now tested positive, up by  from , the day before.The number of people in intensive care and hospital in Scotland has fallen in the past  hours, by seven to  and by  to , respectively, which she said is cause for \"real optimism\".Her comments come as experts from Oxford Universitys Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine said their analysis of Covid- data in Scotland suggests the peak of the virus may have passed.Professor Carl Heneghan called on the Scottish Government to begin opening up the economy as soon as possible to help fight a second wave in winter as he believes the virus is seasonal.A Framework for Decision Making says Covid- causes harm in at least four ways.The first is the \"direct and tragic harm to peoplersquos health\", while the second is the wider impact on Scotlands health and social care services.The third is the harm to society, including the effects of isolation and the impact on childrens wellbeing from closed schools.The last is the \"enormous impact on our economy, with a potential fall of  per cent in GDP during the period of lockdown\".The document adds: \"This is unprecedented and is causing deep uncertainty and hardship for many businesses, iniduals and households.\"The damaging effect on poverty and inequality may be profound.\"Closures and job losses have been inevitable, even with the unprecedented support provided by government.\"And the impacts will intensy the longer the lockdown continues: we will see more businesses unable to recover and we risk the scarring effects of unemployment.\"The risks of increasing hardship and increasing poverty are real. This in turn risks damage to the health of the population.\"We must do everything possible to avoid permanent, structural damage to our economy.\"Ms Sturgeon said the paper is the start of an \"adult conversation\" about how lockdown restrictions could be lted.Matt Hancock, the UK Health Secretary, said maintaining a ldquofour nations approach was essential to tackling the pandemic, and suggested the Scottish Governmentrsquos plan was based on his five tests for relaxing lockdown measures.He also stressed the need for all four governments of the UK to continue working together.When asked by the Herald why Westminster had not been able to produce a similarly detailed plan to that of the Scottish Governmentrsquos, he said: ldquoWe have set out the five tests that are needed for us to make changes to the lockdown measures and the Scottish Government proposals are based on those tests.The minister said a united approach from Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland was ldquothe best way to go and said: ldquoI think that having the four nations of the UK work together on this has been important thus far, not just on social distancing but on testing. The country has essentially moved together.ldquoItrsquos important that us having set out our tests, and now the Scottish government has set out its approach, which is very similar and based on the five tests we have set out, that a UK-wide approach is the best way to go.Opposition parties welcomed the Scottish Governments paper, but also stressed the importance of a UK-wide exit strategy.Scottish Tory leader Jackson Carlaw said: ldquoThe priority remains to save lives, protect the NHS and social care system and ensure the ongoing protection and welfare of vulnerable groupsldquoWe should begin on a phased basis to restore non-essential public services and amenities and enable people toto work, consistent with ensuring the achievement of the first three priorities.\"Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said a phased approach to lting the lockdown was right, and should be based on the principle that saving lives and peoples health must \"take priority over commercial interests\".He said cross-border co-operation is critical.The Scottish Greens said more detail was needed, particularly on testing.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, said it will shortly publish a guide for retailers to help the wider industry re-open stores \"in a safe way once government indicates they can do so\".________________________________________________________________News from trusted and credible sources is essential at all times, but especially now as the coronavirus pandemic impacts on all aspects of our lives.

It will also be one of the last to fully emerge from the lockdown.\"An extended period of social distancing will mean that many hospitality businesses will not be able to operate fully, and many will not be able to open at all. Hospitality is a sector built around socialising, so there must be Government support for businesses that continue to be hit by this crisis, she added.Emma McClarkin for the British Beer  Pub Association said: \"Pubs are the original social network, so reopening them with social distancing restrictions is going to be extremely dficult, for staff and customers alike.\"Its clear that the Government are going to need to give pubs special consideration for a re-start as well as specic support just for them.\"The Job Retention Scheme must continue for pubs throughout their closure along with a back to work scheme with the same level of support when they can reopen. Such measures will save jobs whilst the trade slowly recovers.Ms McClarkin said when businesses could reopen, trade could be down by as much as half and will take time for consumer confidence to build up again.Earlier, UK Finance, representing the banking and finance sector, said it had so far provided over pound.bn of lending to small and medium-sized enterprises through the Governmentrsquos Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme[CBILS].Total lending under the loan scheme had doubled in the week from April  with an increase of pound.bn.

The fact that CBILS are now only at that level at a time of the worst economic emergency in our letimes is a clear sign that they are inadequate.He added: ldquoThe Government must recognise the scheme is not working adequately and change it urgently. The future of many of our small firms depends on its decisions.The SNP said the level of loans to businesses was ldquowoeful.Nationalist backbencher Alan Brown, who sits on the Commons Business Committee, said: ldquoAlan Brown MP said: ldquoThis crisis is a crucial time for the UK Government to take the pressure off business but the support laid out by Westminster means that struggling businesses are missing out on billions of pounds of vital funding.ldquoBusiness and industry has been clear: they need urgent financial support to get them through this dficult time.

Age is revered within the Gothic Palace, no more so than in the gilded House of Lords, where time passes either slowly or very slowly.As time has passed for me and snow has now settled on the roof, I have seen novice MPs rail and rage against the antique practices of the Gothic Parliament, only for them a few years in to become zealous defenders of its noble traditions.Of course, it cannot be denied that some of the traditions are more noble than others. The days of MPs having to wear a top hat to make a point of order have thankfully passed.But there is sometimes an unseen logic behind some parliamentary practices.Calling someone honourable or right honourable might seem quaint but it is meant to keep the atmosphere in the chamber genial it is hard, so the theory goes, to be overly disparaging to a political opponentyou have to call him or her honourable. Although, wit and irony can be the greatest of parliamentary weapons.One of the more incomprehensible traditions that perplexes and annoys new MPs is the voting system. When legislatures around the globe use technology to cast votes in the blink of an eye, the denizens of Westminster have to traipse through wide, dusty corridors to have their names ticked off in a ledger, Hogwarts-style.Not long ago, the youthful SNP MP Hannah Bardell fell foul of the Commons Speaker when she took to social media to post a video from within the Lobby, showing just how ridiculous it all was for honourable members to go through -minute vote after -minute vote to decide on interminable parts of the Brexit process.While many would say the Livingston MP had an extremely good point, others would suggest there is a practical reason for what seems an inane impracticality the delayed process gives the party whips a chance to gently, or not so gently, encourage colleagues to file into the correct lobby pressing a button would rob them of the time to use the black art of persuasion.Resistance to change meant that in the late s there was, to say the least, a deal of opposition to the TV cameras being allowed in to broadcast democracy in action many MPs thought voters would be more interested in hairdos and clothes than what was actually coming out of the mouths of their politicians.But now, necessity has once again pulled up at the gates of Westminster and MPs are being asked to skip a century from the th to the st.The video-conferencing tool of Zoom is being used, which to many members was hitherto an ice lolly from their salad days of the s.As I write, the initial experiment has gone relatively well. There were, of course, a few glitches. David Mundell, the former Scottish Secretary, was, MPs were told, ldquounable to connect during the first digital PMQs. No comment.Learning to use the mute button seems to be one of the more important aspects. During the Lordsrsquo virtual session Green peer Baroness Jones admitted she was slow to unmute and eventually askedshe could put her question but was graciously told she was too late.However, the most embarrassing moment in this new age of digital parliamentary democracy came when Vaughan Gething, the Welsh Health Minister, turned the air blue with an expletive-laden tirade to make matters worse it turned out to be against one of his own Labour colleagues Jenny Rathbone.He later apologised to her but, somewhat disdainfully, brushed the incident aside on Twitter as an ldquounwelcome distraction at a time of unprecedented challenge. The unprecedented challenge being coronavirus, of course, not new technology.Asto demonstrate how our unhurried Parliament adheres to a process of evolution rather than revolution, MPs backed electronic voting well, almost.That model of modernity Jacob Rees-Mogg pointed out that a committee of MPs would first look at the procedure and assess whether it was \"workable\" or not. Which is a fair point the last thing the Commons wants is for a vote to be invalidated. Although, I gently point out, they do seem to have nailed down how to do electronic voting in other parts of the UK and across the globe, where parliaments have been pressing buttons for many years.The urbane Commons Leader reappeared this week at the dispatch box to announce even he had to agree to go with the technological flow this week albeit one could sense with a deal of pin-striped reluctance.\"In , the Old Etonian declaimed, ldquowhen the Black Death affected this country, Parliament couldnt sit and didnt the session was cancelled.ldquoThanks to modern technology, even I have moved on from  and Im glad to say that we can sit to carry out these fundamental constitutional s. And Im enormously grateful to many who are just as traditionalist as I am, who have accepted these constraints.\" Necessity indeed."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-sturgeon-urged-continue-united-approach-publishing-lockdown-exit-strategy","story":"The Westminster Health Secretary said it was the \"best way forward\" to coming out of the lockdown during the daily press briefing this evening.Matt Hancock also suggested the Scottish Governments -page exit strategy document was based on his own five-point plan, and said the two were \"very similar\".When asked why his government had been unable to produce a plan of similar detail by the Herald, he said: ldquoWe have set out the five tests that are needed for us to make changes to the lockdown measures and the Scottish Government proposals are based on those tests.:Coronavirus: Social distancing to continue in schools when they gradually reopenThe minister said that a united approach from Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland was ldquothe best way to go and said: ldquoI think that having the four nations of the UK work together on this has been important thus far, not just on social distancing but on testing.

However, he urged the Justice Secretary to reflect on what was happening in England and Wales, where court services were making use of telephone, video and other technology to allow remote hearings and procedural business to take place.Kirkwall Sherf Court has been closed due to the coronavirus crisis, with emergency business transferred to a ‘hub’ in Inverness. However, concerns have been raised about the impact of this transfer, as well as obstacles in the way of securing new ship orders and Powers of Attorney.The Justice Secretary acknowledged these concerns, and offered to pursue the issue with the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service.Mr McArthur said: “Nothing is ‘business as usual’ at the moment, and the well-being of court staff and the wider public has to be the number one priority.  However, there are many aspects of civil court business that we cannot afford to put on pause.“Over recent weeks, I have been contacted by local solicitors in Orkney, extremely concerned at the dficulties they have faced in getting urgent business completed.  Delays in getting a new ship Orders or Powers of Attorney in place, for example, can have serious consequences. Vulnerable people rely on effective and timely court processes that make sure their rights are properly safeguarded.“In England and Wales we are seeing technology being used to enable more court business to be undertaken. There is no reason why a similar approach cannot be adopted in Scotland.  Indeed, Sherf Courts already conduct procedural hearings by tele-conferencing.“The justice secretary insists that progress is being made, but has offered to take up these concerns with the Scottish Court and Tribunals Service.

The yoga postures we’ll be doing in the sessions bring some easy, relaxing movements for the body. Mindfulness allows us to be in the present moment rather than worrying about the past or future which can make it easier to accept change and to make the adjustments necessary to feel well.”Angela Mitchell, national director of Diabetes Scotland, said: “We are proud to have over  local groups serving communities across Scotland. Of course, not everyone can attend a group, especially now when we’re advised against all but essential trips out of our homes.“We had already planned to introduce digital peer support groups this year but due to social distancing measures we brought our launch forward.  Many people at home are feeling isolated and,you’re also managing a long-term condition like diabetes, it can be even more challenging. We want to support people with diabetes in any way that we can at this time. As well as online peer support groups, yoga and mindfulness, we also have a helpline, online forum and the Diabetes Scotland team can be reached as we continue to work from home.”Groups meet in private sessions over Zoom. Peer support group times are still flexible while a schedule is created to meet demand. Mindfulness and yoga will run on Wednesdays at pm and Fridays at pm for the next four weeks.Anyone who is interested in joining either peer support or mindfulness and yoga should email scotland@diabetes.org.uk to be invited to a group and given instructions on how to access Zoom .Guidance regarding diabetes and coronavirus can be found at www.diabetes.org.uk coronavirus or by calling the Diabetes Scotland helpline on    or emailing helpline@diabetes.org.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Many farmers and crofters have already responded to our call not to leave it to the last minute # but we need more of you to do so.“Now, more than ever, it’s crucial we keep money flowing into our rural communities and keep funding our crofters and farmers.“We know that crofters often seek the support of our area office staff to complete and submit their SAF applications and, usually, that has involved a last minute rush in the first two weeks of May. In normal times, this is manageable – but these are unprecedented times.“Our staff are working incredibly hard and are still directly helping customers by phone, but the changes to our usual way of working mean that we cannot currently offer face-to-face support, or for people to simply drop by their local office.

We still have the option of extending the SAF window beyond  May but the current rate of applications suggests that should not be needed # providing people respond to this request.“Whatever  you were planning to do today and this week, please make time to submit your SAF or make an appointment to get support to do so.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This might included certain businesses being allowed to reopen where customers can safely stay at a two metre distance, and the reformatting of classrooms before pupils canto schools.The First Minister has advised that restrictions are likely to continue in some form for at least the rest of this year, and possibly beyond that.She added that the Scottish Government would be relying on the latest data to inform it of what the best approach for Scotland will be and explained that work to expand the nations testing capacity was ongoing. When asked about whether certain regions of Scotland might undergo a more localised approach, the First Minister said she wasn#t ruling out anything that might help us deal with the virus.#Today I am seeking to start a grown up conversation with the public about the complex decisions that lie ahead of us as we look beyond lockdown,# she said.“As we have done all along, we will seek to inform the public with the best scientic advice possible, but the science will never be exact and we are in uncharted territory so we also need to make careful judgements and be prepared to adapt and change course as we go.“We want to ease restrictions, but we cannot rule out having to reapply them should the virus run out of control.#Nicola Sturgeon said she and her colleagues would be relying on the latest data to inform them of what the best approach for Scotland will be and explained that work to expand the nations testing capacity was ongoing.“Every day we see evidence that this virus causes real harm, but so too do the lockdown measures we are taking to contain it,# she continued.#This is causing harm to the economy and living standards, to children’s education and to mental health and wellbeing.“That is why we need to try to find a better balance than the one we have now, but as we do so we cannot take our eye off the need to suppress the virus and minimise the damage it does.“It is only when we are sure the virus is under control that we can even start to ease any of the restrictions because the virus will not have gone away.#Nicola Sturgeon has advised everyone to take part in the conversation about how we might leave lockdown.

This means the door can be locked while the toilet is in use to ensure privacy and social distancing from anyone  waiting to use the facility.Hayley Green, OIC head of IT and facilities, said: “We have received messages from key workers askingsome toilets could be re-opened on routes they travel while at work.#So, we have come up with a solution which takes account of the guidance around social distancing to combat the spread of COVID- and provide these key workers with the facilities they require.”The toilets will be stocked with hand soap and toilet roll and will receive a daily clean.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

For urban wildle, which includes mammals and birds living alongside people in towns, this will affect levels of disturbance from humans and food availability.In recent weeks there have already been reports of animals adapting to the reduced human activity including Kashmiri goats roaming around Llandudno, North Wales, troops of monkeys in Singapore, wild boars in cities across Europe and Coyotes wandering streets during daylight hours in the US.Lead researcher Professor Dawn Scott, an expert in Mammal Ecology and Conservation, will use this unprecedented time to try to collect information and answer the study’s overarching question # How have urban animals responded to changes in human activity during the COVID- lockdown The research will collect records on any observations of unusual animal behaviour during the lockdown, determine the effects of reduction in human activity in city and town centres on urban wildle, and the effects increased human activity in gardens and outdoors space is having. The data from the survey will then be combined with other data from media searches to produce a report on the response of urban animals to lockdown across the globe.Professor Scott, head of the School of Le Sciences at Keele University, said: “Urban animals have been able to adapt to our landscape and live alongside towns, cities and suburbs so we know they are already highly adaptable. This flexibility in behaviour means they can usually quickly respond to changing conditions, including the absence of humans, which is happening during the lockdown.“Across the world we have seen reports of animals roaming cities and in locations that they wouldn’t normally be seen during the day. Social isolation is an opportunity for many to learn more about nature and how we can support it. We’re asking people to take part in our study and help us discover how urban animals are responding due to our change in behaviour.”To find out more and take part in the study visit: www.keele.ac.uk wildlestudycopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The current loan scheme is up, running and working for many. Now we need another big push to get money out the door faster.ldquoThis is a race against time, and the only winning strategy is scale, speed and simplicity.ldquoThe Treasury, British Business Bank and lenders deserve huge credit for their speed and ambition so far. The millions of jobs they have saved today are vital livelihoods protected for the future.ldquoBut with the lockdown extended there is no room to pause. The financial strain on some businesses cannot be underestimated.ldquoThese recommendations are based on thousands of conversations with struggling firms of all sizes and aimed at helping those who have been left behind so far. A new wave of support is vital to local communities and our small and mid-sized businesses.ldquoHelping firms that have fallen through the cracks will protect jobs and livelihoods as the crisis unfolds and ensure a solid foundation to build on. It is far more cost effective to stop businesses collapsing now than create jobs in the future.ldquoThe greater the number of companies helped to survive, the sooner the UK economy can restart and revive.copy -.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years.

It is expected to be pressed into service as soon as possible.Health board chairman said demand for testing on the Scottish mainland had seen tests take up to five days for processing.But having the kit on-island, he said, would see results turned round in a matter of hours.Mr Robinson said he recognised there had been a #hiatus# after initial testing coronavirus had stopped.#We recognised in NHS Shetland that capacity for testing was going to be an issue. Testing in Glasgow was going from  hours to five days.#I think we recognised there was a need to get something locally.# raquoNHS Shetland, like many other essential service providers, employs people whose parents and grandparents did now grow up in Shetland, or even in the UK. Let#s allow them, women and man alike, to be fully welcomed as valued members of our communities, with equal status.Let#s make the changes needed to fully include them and their families and so appreciate the strength in ersity that is their much appreciated contribution to modern Shetland, modern Scotland and modern Britain.Peter#s choice of poetry is particularly relevant during a week when British farmers chartered planes to collect  farm workers from Romania.The manager of the airline says he has already put in a bid for the next six flights.These Romanians form the first link in a long chain that magically re-stocks our supermarket shelves while we lie sleeping in our beds every night.For those with an apatite for further contemplation, I would recommend the following article:Thanks for the helpful and interesting link Malcolm. It almost makes a case for education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!Reading it helped me to reflect on how dangerous it is for us to accept a narrow and rigid definition of what makes for a permissible #Shetlander#,and how important it is to reject the idea that some are entitled to more of a voice in that discussion than others.Those wishing to contest the need for such points to be made should first read Malcolm#s recommended article and then reflect on how recently a SMUHA squad featured a black-faced member of the NHS.As the article points out there is a prospect that this visus will not lead to more harmonious societies.The price of the peaceful cooperation we should wish for with all our neighboursis vigilance against those who would needlessly turn us against each other.Ilove how Peter and Malcolm appear to be so in veneration of each other, just a tad too preachy for me. As for #an education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!# I would respectfully suggest a basis eduction in the STEM subjects would be of far more value to humankind. That way most would understand what a virus is, how a vaccine works. The sort of simple science stuff that lives depend on.Humanities educated, Like Boris Johson and Rees Mogg. Go for it, Peter!One hesitates to perturb so a warm a socialist embrace. However, re the linked article, any author who discusses Nazism and bigotry in one breath and then Trump, Bolsonaro and Modi in the next while omitting to mention China’s Xi Jinping or the North Korean monster, Kim Jong-un, is clearly peddling a dishonest agenda.It#s a wonder people #educated in the humanities# didn#t see that. Interesting.Having installed himself as president for le, Xi is reportedly responsible for the most appalling, vicious repression and imprisonment of a million Uighur people and the relentless destruction of their culture in China’s Xinjiang province. The “ View” is clear: “Speak out or be complicit.”“Without sustained pressure, the grotesque human rights abuses seen in Xinjiang will not just continue but intensy. The time to speak up arrived long ago. Countries should be shouting about this from the rooftops.”If you want a chilling reminder of Nazism, guys, look no further.Does anyone want to remind John the NHS is socialist in intent and inception Did he learnall this from the wonderful British Empire ,I wonder, so ,he is a poor apprentice.John Tulloch#s unwillingness to engage with the main points previously made is unsurprising.Have I missed something here  An article about testing equipment arriving in Shetland allowing results to be available in hours rather than days has very quickly turned into a debate about immigrants, racism, humanities -v- STEM Education and extreme left right wing politics. It’s not always necessary to find something to disagree about.@Stephen Johnston, I agree. That#s precisely why I hadn’t commented on any coronavirus item, here or where, until my above post. The coronavirus pandemic is a rapidly unfolding tragedy, a national and global emergency. Using it as a political football is completely inappropriate.However, there comes a point when people pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, endlessly stirring the pot of social ision and bitterness, must be challenged. Ideally, we would support those faced with tackling the crisis # at all levels # and keep our criticisms constructive. Or keep quiet and let them get on with it. Lessons can be learned later, with the benefit of hindsight, once all the facts are knownAs they say, # you won#t help, at least, get out of the way.#JT, straight from the right wing playbook# Tell them to be quiet. It#s an effective way to silence people # who could disagree that the coronavirus is a terrible tragedy after all  But#JT, How is the racism suffered every day for thousands of NHS staff not up for discussion  Why do you wish to silence that discussion Why don#t you deal with issue, rather than making a series of accusations and personal attacks What facts about racism faced by NHS staff are not known  Maybe not known to you, but lived by the people in the poem. Maybe for you racism and anti-immigrant sentiment is a political football to be put away until you see fit. But for the people who have lived with it through their lives, suffered because of it, it is a matter of day to day struggle. And yes, a political issue.When John declared that “People pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, must be challenged” I assumed that he was going to say something about Dr Mr Lt.Cdr Tinkler.For what it’s worth John, my own qualications are an HGV and PSV licence sothat’s what you regard as a superior education, you must have the mother of all inferiority complexes.Whenever anyone tries to bring up subjects like racism or social exclusion on this forum, the same few iniduals fly into an apoplectic rage and you, John, are always one of them.As someone once said:“If you won’t help, at least, get out of the way.”Malcolm Henry Johnson, O dear me, that chip on the shoulder. It was actually Surgeon Lieutenant Commander with  years training in Nuclear, Biological and ChemicalWarfare including triage and casualty care. I rejoice I never had time to waste on the humanities, more important work to do, like keeping people breathing.I know, tell me about it Ian. I for one would be fine without HGV drivers. In fact, I have been training our blessed grandson on how to handle a mule and cart . On a side note, I was exposed to radiation as a child in the s. The triage nurse was excellent and the radiation never did me any harm. So what I am saying is you are both valued by old John Thomas.I’ve often pondered the nature of predictability and wondered: What came first, the Surgeon Lieutenant Commander or the wind-up, clockwork toy To Peter Hamilton and John Thomas I say, thank you, for exemplying my point about using the coronavirus tragedy as a political football. Perfect.I hadn#t commented about NHS or care home staff. However, relatives of mine are currently benefitting from their work and their courage and conviction is truly admirable. Whatever their race or nationality, I heartily applaud it.Call me what you like. I won#t be drawn into an unseemly, polemic#Punch and Judy# food fight over the crisis by personal attacks. I invite readers to check my above points and judge for themselves.Have a nice day, boys.JT:#I won’t be drawn into an unseemly, polemic “Punch and Judy” food fight over the crisis by personal attacks. ##pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments,#Pot meet kettle.

Prof Pennington said the Western Isles, which at the start of the week had only six confirmed cases of Covid-, could exit the restrictions as a “test-bed” before wider lockdowns were lted.Politicians said the idea was worth considering, but still carried risk.Prof Pennington said: #There could soon be a case for a geographical lting of restrictions # such as in some of the Scottish islands and the Highlands and Grampian.#The Western Isles and Orkney are the obvious candidates to be the test beds for an exit strategy for the country. Travel is restricted because they are islands and have extremely low levels of confirmed cases. You can control access to them and re-open things like shops and churches etc and get back gradually to normal le again.#As for people travelling to the islands it is to be remembered that the vast majority of people have not been affected.”He added that effective testing facilities, which would give a quick result, must first be in place to allow any restrictions to be eased.Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan said that while the idea had merit, islanders would be alarmedthey felt their health was being compromised as part of an experiment.He said: #It is unfortunate that the language of ‘testbeds’ has been used by some to describe the Western Isles, which has disturbed a number of people who have contacted me about this subject.“We have a population that is more elderly and more vulnerable to this virus than most, and so slowing down the spread of the virus has to be our overriding priority.“Despite the fact we have a low number of confirmed cases, the true number of infected islanders is likely to be signicantly higher. There is certainly now a need for more testing locally.#We need to keep observing the social distancing guidelines and cannot allow any room for complacency.“Given that we may well be behind the infection curve for the rest of Scotland, there is a good case to be made for a regional approach to lting lockdown restrictions, when that happens. However, this also has to ensure that the islands are not subject to any influx of travellers from other areas where the virus has already peaked.”Highlands and Islands Conservative MSP Donald Cameron added: “Any proposal to trial a relaxation of the lockdown rules must have the full support of local residents with the protection of the most vulnerable remaining paramount, as well as ensuring the NHS is not put under any unnecessary strain.“However, the geography of the islands means they are suitable for a possible trial and Professor Pennington’s suggestions certainly deserve serious consideration.“Given the fragile nature of the islands# local economy at this time, we need to give our communities every chance of not only getting through this pandemic but also kick-starting a recovery as quickly as possible.

The establishment of a Medical School at Magee in Derry is a core commitment within the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ Agreement which led to the restoration of the Executive in January. googletag.cmd.push Redmond McFadden, President of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce, said: “The establishment of a Graduate Entry Medical School in the city has long been promised for the North West. Its importance, however, has been made even clearer in light of the COVID- crisis. By training and retaining new doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers locally, we can signicantly bolster Northern Ireland’s healthcare workforce and ease pressures on our health service. “A medical school in the North West would not just have signicant benefits for our health service but also for our regional economy. It has also been identied as a core capital project of the Derry and Strabane City Deal. An increase in students in the city would lead to an economic boost and a more highly-skilled local labour force would be a key economic driver for the entire region. googletag.cmd.push “Our health service is under extreme strain at the moment and our health and social care workers are undertaking huge efforts to keep us safe.

She was backing a call from the Royal College of Occupational Therapists. “We owe a massive debt of gratitude to our health professionals and other essential workers,” said Sinead McLaughlin. “The UK government must now honour that debt by giving them the right to continue to live and work in the UK. That is the right thing to do, it is also a necessary thing to do to protect our health service. googletag.cmd.push “That principle should extend across our economy. Essential workers in the health sector, social care and also in agriculture and other core industries are needed, now and into the future as we emerge from the twin nightmares of Covid- and Brexit. “I also make a plea to the health minister, Robin Swann, to commit to increasing the training of health workers, including by giving immediate approval for the Graduate Entry Medical School in Derry, to increase the supply of doctors in Northern Ireland. This is needed more than ever.” Karin Orman, Assistant Director of Professional Practic, says: “Occupational therapists are a key part of the UK’s response to the COVID- crisis, supporting people as they are discharged from hospitals as well as supporting those .m people that are having to self-isolate in their homes. googletag.cmd.push “The pressures on occupational therapists on the frontline have grown rapidly and we need to prioritise the future of the workforce, particularly in the next - months as the demands on rehabilitation in communities will grow.

We are therefore calling on the UK government to extend the visa extension scheme to include occupational therapists working in the NHS and in social care.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Fireside selectors picking teams is one of Ireland’s national past times. This selection is based on players who took part in county senior, intermediate and junior finals -. It is based on the grade they were playing at that time. Five from each is selected. Just like putting five litres into a one litre jar. Here goes...  - Antoacutein McMullan For years it was the ‘big boot’ in defence who would do the kicking out. Distance was important. Now it has developed into an art form with the qualities being, a cool head, the ability to kick the ball through basketball hoop at a distance of  metres, safe hands and cat like reflexesrequired. Antoacutein has all the credentials. googletag.cmd.push  - Oisin Duffy A good defender is one that the forward hates playing against and the energetic Duffy was one of those prize assets. Firm in the tackle, virtually impossible to stop on the run and full of scores from his defensive position. His display in the Ulster Intermediate championship against Magheracloone, where he scored - from play, was exceptional.  - Brendan Rogers No player can change gear as quickly as the tall Brendan when he motors out of defence. He would excel in any sport and could play anywhere on the football field. A brilliant hurler as well. Seeing a forward chasing him with tongue hanging out is something were are used to. A real pleasure to watch. googletag.cmd.push  - Karl McKaigueThere is a famous film called the Quiet Man. Karl could be titled the quiet marker in defence. He has snuffed out some of the best forwards in the game and still manages to slip forward and get a point or two. Tackles the ball and not the man, so he rarely gives away frees. His anticipation of where the ball is going to drop is exceptional.  - Niall KeenanA neat and tidy footballer. His build would suggest corner forward material but he is actually a quality defender. Came through the minor and U ranks showing class all the way. His display at Croke Park in the  minor semi-final for Derry marked him as a player with a great future and he has lived up to that billing.  - Joe Gray Play anywhere Joewas the heart beat of Faughanvale teams for the most of two decades. He led a young team from the junior ranks to a solid intermediate outfit. Played and managed at dferent times and had a few games with Derry in the s. Has all the skills and a read dead eye free taker.  - Jimmy O’Connor Jimmy was ‘spotted’ by an Derry U scout when he was closer to  than . Now, nearer  than , he keeps up an amazing standard of fitness. Normally listed as a corner forward he is let loose to conduce the orchestra. Not the biggest but he makes light of that with his wide range of skills.  - Enda Muldoon Could have played on any team, in any era. Great hands and a master of the ever accurate foot pass. Always made the game look easy since he broke into a Derry minor team in . Now a qualied coach, passing on his skills to the next generation the youngsters could not have had a better tutor. A gentleman on and off the field.  - Mark Lynch From enthralling Croke Park in the  All-Ireland minor final, at the age of , Mark has continued to show quality. Stepped down two years ago after a long inter county career. Still the heart and soul of Banagher teams. He was exceptional in their senior championship run last year and the intermediate title a year previous. In his all round skills is the mastery of free taking.  - Michael McNaughtGrandson of the great Mickey McNaught who was on the Derry  National League winning team. His accurate left foot is one of the reasons why the Waterside men have become a solid force in Derry football. Can play midfield or half forward and seldom is below par. A very accurate free taker.  - Richard KingRichard broke into the Wolfhound’s senior team at the age of  as a corner forward. Now a commanding figure in the half forward line and an excellent free taker. Was a key figure in the treble winning junior team of . His rather harsh sending off against Red Hugh’s almost certainly cost Limavady the Ulster title. At  there is a lot more to come from this excellent footballer  - Enda Lynn Good enough to captain his county for two seasons. This man is a virtual scoring machine. Such is his dedication that he has been known to train on Christmas Day. His pace and tireless running makes him nearly impossible to mark. Missed a lot of action last season with an injury. Greenlough and Derry will be glad to see him back againthe action ever resumes.  - Paudie O’Neill Probably the best club footballer in Derry never to get a county call. Time after time, he would win games on his own for the Henry Joys. His scoring tallies were mind boggling but like a lot of good footballer had ongoing injury problems. A loyal club player he often played through the pain barrier.  - Kevin O’ConnorEvery year he postpones his retirement is another good year for Foreglen. From being an excellent half forward he now brings his deadly accuracy to the role of target man. A quite superb free taker who is always calm and measured. Played a leading role in their intermediate championship win last season.  - Conleith Gilligan Has to be one of the highest ever scorers in Derry club football. From his teenage years to his mid-s his quality never dimmed. Be it from frees or open play, he seldom missed the target. His pace and ability to be in the right place at the right time marked him as one of the best. His retirement left a huge void in the Shamrock’s attack. He is now passing on his skills to others.

Fireside selectors picking teams is one of Ireland’s national past times. This selection is based on players who took part in county senior, intermediate and junior finals -. It is based on the grade they were playing at that time. Five from each is selected. Just like putting five litres into a one litre jar. Here goes...  - Antoacutein McMullan For years it was the ‘big boot’ in defence who would do the kicking out. Distance was important. Now it has developed into an art form with the qualities being, a cool head, the ability to kick the ball through basketball hoop at a distance of  metres, safe hands and cat like reflexesrequired. Antoacutein has all the credentials. googletag.cmd.push  - Oisin Duffy A good defender is one that the forward hates playing against and the energetic Duffy was one of those prize assets. Firm in the tackle, virtually impossible to stop on the run and full of scores from his defensive position. His display in the Ulster Intermediate championship against Magheracloone, where he scored - from play, was exceptional.  - Brendan Rogers No player can change gear as quickly as the tall Brendan when he motors out of defence. He would excel in any sport and could play anywhere on the football field. A brilliant hurler as well. Seeing a forward chasing him with tongue hanging out is something were are used to. A real pleasure to watch. googletag.cmd.push  - Karl McKaigueThere is a famous film called the Quiet Man. Karl could be titled the quiet marker in defence. He has snuffed out some of the best forwards in the game and still manages to slip forward and get a point or two. Tackles the ball and not the man, so he rarely gives away frees. His anticipation of where the ball is going to drop is exceptional.  - Niall KeenanA neat and tidy footballer. His build would suggest corner forward material but he is actually a quality defender. Came through the minor and U ranks showing class all the way. His display at Croke Park in the  minor semi-final for Derry marked him as a player with a great future and he has lived up to that billing.  - Joe Gray Play anywhere Joewas the heart beat of Faughanvale teams for the most of two decades. He led a young team from the junior ranks to a solid intermediate outfit. Played and managed at dferent times and had a few games with Derry in the s. Has all the skills and a read dead eye free taker.  - Jimmy O’Connor Jimmy was ‘spotted’ by an Derry U scout when he was closer to  than . Now, nearer  than , he keeps up an amazing standard of fitness. Normally listed as a corner forward he is let loose to conduce the orchestra. Not the biggest but he makes light of that with his wide range of skills.  - Enda Muldoon Could have played on any team, in any era. Great hands and a master of the ever accurate foot pass. Always made the game look easy since he broke into a Derry minor team in . Now a qualied coach, passing on his skills to the next generation the youngsters could not have had a better tutor. A gentleman on and off the field.  - Mark Lynch From enthralling Croke Park in the  All-Ireland minor final, at the age of , Mark has continued to show quality. Stepped down two years ago after a long inter county career. Still the heart and soul of Banagher teams. He was exceptional in their senior championship run last year and the intermediate title a year previous. In his all round skills is the mastery of free taking.  - Michael McNaughtGrandson of the great Mickey McNaught who was on the Derry  National League winning team. His accurate left foot is one of the reasons why the Waterside men have become a solid force in Derry football. Can play midfield or half forward and seldom is below par. A very accurate free taker.  - Richard KingRichard broke into the Wolfhound’s senior team at the age of  as a corner forward. Now a commanding figure in the half forward line and an excellent free taker. Was a key figure in the treble winning junior team of . His rather harsh sending off against Red Hugh’s almost certainly cost Limavady the Ulster title. At  there is a lot more to come from this excellent footballer  - Enda Lynn Good enough to captain his county for two seasons. This man is a virtual scoring machine. Such is his dedication that he has been known to train on Christmas Day. His pace and tireless running makes him nearly impossible to mark. Missed a lot of action last season with an injury. Greenlough and Derry will be glad to see him back againthe action ever resumes.  - Paudie O’Neill Probably the best club footballer in Derry never to get a county call. Time after time, he would win games on his own for the Henry Joys. His scoring tallies were mind boggling but like a lot of good footballer had ongoing injury problems. A loyal club player he often played through the pain barrier.  - Kevin O’ConnorEvery year he postpones his retirement is another good year for Foreglen. From being an excellent half forward he now brings his deadly accuracy to the role of target man. A quite superb free taker who is always calm and measured. Played a leading role in their intermediate championship win last season.  - Conleith Gilligan Has to be one of the highest ever scorers in Derry club football. From his teenage years to his mid-s his quality never dimmed. Be it from frees or open play, he seldom missed the target. His pace and ability to be in the right place at the right time marked him as one of the best. His retirement left a huge void in the Shamrock’s attack. He is now passing on his skills to others.

Seonaidh Mullan, who played camogie and ladies’ football for Ballerin, ran a STEM cell registration event following her diagnosis to encourage people to register as donors. The event, hosted at the GAA club in Ballerin, resulted in over  donors registering as potential lesavers. Camogie club Chairperson Melinda Robinson said many in the community were grieving the loss of a friend. “Seonaidh was an extremely private person, very modest. There was no fuss with her. She was the first at training and the last to go home. googletag.cmd.push “When we had younger players coming on the team who maybe faced dferent things in le, she was the one those girls felt confident in sharing a story with. “If they were having a bad evening, she was the girl they went to. The girls thought very highly of her. Seonaidh was steeped in the le of her GAA club. She was always on the starting , and her experience on the hockey pitch brought a fierceness to her tackling on the camogie pitch. Even on the warmest days, she would train in the black Ballerin waterproof jacket and bandana, socks to her knees, urging her teammates to ‘come on and be serious’. googletag.cmd.push Her words on the pitch were always of positive encouragement, but she wasn’t afraid to voice her opinion to the refereeshe disagreed with the decision. With coronavirus regulations limiting funerals to immediate family only, the club have taken the innovative step of creating a virtual guard of honour. Club members sent pictures of themselves in Seonaidh’s beloved red and white Ballerin colours in order to pay their respects. Seonaidh is survived by her husband Stephen, her son Oisiacuten and daughter Una and the wider Black and Mullan families. “People see Seonaidh’s picture on social media or the paper and see the mother, the camoacuteg, the woman who left behind a legacy for STEM cell recruitment. She was all of those things,” said Melinda. “But strip all that away and Seonaidh was our friend, a friend we’ve lost, a voice we won’t hear again, a smiling face we won’t see.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Castledawson man Dean McErlean made the discovery while walking his dogs at the foot of the Moyola River, where it enters Lough Neagh. “It says ‘Joseph McManmoy’ on it,” he told the County Derry Post. “We would take the dogs down there for a walk and let them swim and we found it lying in the sand. It was half-buried but I saw the top of it. “It doesn’t look like a medicine bottle – it’s clear. I knew it was old glass because you could still see the bubbles in it, and it wasn’t symmetrical. googletag.cmd.push “I knew it was a good age, but I didn’t know what it was for, whether it was for whiskey or medicine or anything.” Dean then took to the internet to seehe could unearth any details about the mysterious ‘Joseph McManmoy’, but his search drew a blank. “The first thing I did was Google it, but there was absolutely nothing and no name the same. It’s not a usual name. “The name has thrown everybody that I have asked because it’s so unusual.” The search for any trace of the name is still ongoing, but Dean has ensured the bottle has found a safe home. googletag.cmd.push He said: “An aunty of mine is big into traditional, vintage, oddly shaped stuff. “She would have wee medicine bottles and stuff around the house, so I took it home to her. She loved it, she was like an excited child.” While his efforts to find Mr McManmoy have not yet proved fruitful, Dean has his own theory about how the bottle came to rest on the Loughshore. “I would say it has come down the Moyola and washed out in the floods over the wintertime. God knows how long it was lying somewhere .”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mid Ulster councillor Brian McGuigan made the appeal after receiving a number of calls about litter on roads in the Maghera area of south Derry. “I have been inundated with concerns that our countryside is strewn with litter,” he told the County Derry Post. “We all need to take care of our local environment. The litter strewn on our roadside is coming from road users who are not disposing of their rubbish appropriately. “Its important that all road users are aware of the damage to the environment that littering can do.

In addition, another  food parcels were delivered by last Friday.Local council officials have been working in partnership with their colleagues across local government, health trusts and the Department for Communities to set up the hubs.Down Leisure Centre has been transformed into a processing centre to organise deliveries, with other sites currently being identied should they be required, with staff working in split shts, while observing social distancing and other safety protocols.The new service covers the councilrsquos seven even district electoral areas with deliveries focusing on food supplies with the packages including items such as tinned and dried food, cereals and some essential toiletries.Requests for help from the council and its community and voluntary partners are arriving via Access NI which is processing calls from across Northern Ireland on a freephone helpline.Council chairman Charlie Casey says he is pleased to see just how many of the districtrsquos most vulnerable residents have been able to receive food parcel deliveries recently.ldquoOur sincere thanks go to all our partners who worked with us over the Easter break to achieve this and all the volunteers who have already kindly offered their help, he continued.ldquoIt is important that we provide a leline to those following medical advice to shield to protect their health, or who are self-isolating, and have no other means of assistance.The council chairman said that during the local authorityrsquos COVID- response, it will continue to work hard to deliver essential supplies to those who need them and ensure no-one feels alone or isolated at this dficult time.A COVID- community helpline is operational, with those in vulnerable groups seeking support asked to make contact between am and pm, seven days a week, with the helpline managed by Advice NI who are processing calls from across Northern Ireland.The Freephone number is   , while the email is covid@adviceni.net. Contact can also be made by texting ACTION to .All calls that are relevant to the councilrsquos community co-ordination hub will be passed on to the local authority for action, including referrals from the South Eastern and Southern health trusts.The Downpatrick-based County Down Rural Community Network, the Confederation of Community Groups in Newry and Community Advice Newry Mourne and Down are acting as lead organisations for the community groups involved in this response.Members of the public are reminded that the Down Leisure Centre remains closed and that anyone who requests a food parcel will have it delivered to them directly.The County Down Rural Community Network in Downpatrick is acting as one of the lead organisations for the community groups involved in the response to the new food parcel distribution service.Any other volunteers who wish to assist in the delivery of food and supplies or ensure residents on their own at this time receive phone calls to help ease their isolation, are encouraged to register with Volunteer Now via their website.Further information about volunteering is available at www.volunteernow while organisations can identy COVID- volunteering requirements at www.volunteernow organidations.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan dressmaker makes scrubs for frontline workers in lockdown  ","story":"FROM wedding dresses to scrubs ndash thatrsquos the new order of work for Castlewellan bridal dressmaker Shirley Moorhead.Sewing a range of scrubs for nurses and nursing home workers has replaced Shirleyrsquos normal orders of stunning gowns, veils, bridesmaidsrsquo dresses and outfits for the mother of the bride and groom since the coronavirus lockdown.The  year-old was facing a full order book for spring and summer weddings until the lockdown resulted in many weddings being pushed back to the autumn and beyond.The woman behind Fairytale Designs, the mother of five was determined not to let her inactivity and seamstress skills go to waste during the lockdown over the last four weeks.She is now sewing scrubs for over  hours each day in her garden workshop, after  years of experience as a dressmaker.ldquoIrsquom sure that in any home where there is a sewing machine, local people are also doing their bit and working to sew to support the local effort with PPE, said Mrs Moorhead.ldquoAt the moment, while Irsquom being very productive, I canrsquot earn a living with what I do, like so many others. Therersquos plenty like me and we are all in the same boat.ldquoIt started when I received requests from nurses who I made their wedding or bridesmaid dresses in the past for. I ended up making scrubs for some entire hospital wards, male and female and in a iety of sizes.ldquoThat widened out to sewing for staff at local nursing homes. I just want to do something to help, particularly for nursing homes as my daughter, Abigail, works in one in Castlewellan.There is plenty of work to be done to complete her bridal orders, but Mrs Moorhead feels that her priority is for scrubs.ldquoMy weddings have been pushed back until October or November or even next year. There are things that would hamper me. I canrsquot see brides to fit them and I wouldnrsquot want to go too far ahead with orders in case some people gain weight or lose weight, she said.ldquoAlso,the wedding changes seasons, that can change the outfit ordered in style and colour. For instance, a mother of the bride might want a jacket as well or might want to lose or shorten sleeves so I feel I canrsquot go to far ahead with my orders. Brides have needed me to reassure them that everything will be alright for their big day, whenever it happens, and I can absolutely promise that.ldquoAbigail is getting married in November and her sister, Johanna, is getting married next May, so they will be the most special wedding dresses I will make in my letime. I feel that I have to keep going with the scrubs as itrsquos so important. However, I will make sure that I will provide all outfits that have been ordered from me. It has become a family affair as Mrs Moorheadrsquos husband, Joe, who also is unable to work as an engineer in the lockdown, helps with the pressing of the garments while Johanna helps with the sewing.Mrs Moorhead has been creating the scrubs from donated material, much of it brand new, and is very grateful for the donations..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Crossgar.jpg","title":"Crossgar man takes Chance with move to Hong Kong 26 years later opens superstore  ","story":"AT the age of  and without a word of Cantonese, Richard Bowsie left his family and friends behind in his home village of Crossgar for a le of adventure in Hong Kong.Twenty-six years later and now a married father of two, Richard has found love, happiness as well as a successful career as the owner of two second-hand furniture stores in the huge cosmopolitan city with over seven million inhabitants.He and his locally-born we, Mavis, run nd Chance Furniture that provides shoppers in the city and online across the world a virtual Aladdinrsquos Cave with thousands of unique and affordable items - ranging from lacquered tables to pool tables, Chinese vases to Balinese drums.While other young ambitious men were told to lsquogo westrsquo, Richard went east, finding Hong Kong to be every bit as much the land of opportunity as the United States.The father of eight year-old daughter Kailey and son George, whorsquos coming five, literally changed his le in three days when he made the decision to fly to Hong Kong.From working as a leguard at the Tropicana centre in Newcastle and at the former Down Leisure Centre, the former student of the High School, Ballynahinch, had been close to completing his BTec qualication in Leisure Management at the former Newcastle College of Further Education.He ped out of his course a few months shy of graduation due to bullying. While his parents, Margaret and Ken, a well-known architect, were shocked at their middle sonrsquos decision, they were not surprised.He recalled: ldquoI had a friend who had travelled to Hong Kong three months previously. During a phone call he told me that the new international airport was under construction and work was easy to find. Three days later I arrived.ldquoI decided to go by myself as I had been trying to find an exciting job at home for a while but kept being told I was too young for the roles or lacked experience. My parents knew I was ambitious and how frustrated I was becoming with my career ambitions being knocked back all the time.Richard admitted he hadnrsquot a clue what to do once he arrived and took a bar managerrsquos job as an interim position as many of the airport workers drank there.His first job at the airport turned out to be with the Northern Ireland company, Lagan Construction Group, before going to another Belfast-based company, Rotary International, with which he worked for two years.ldquoI felt excited and nervous all at the same time when I first moved to Hong Kong, said Richard.ldquoThe first thing that struck me was the heat, after leaving cold and damp of home. Arriving in  degrees and high humidity was certainly a shock to the system, despite having been on family holidays to France most years with my family and once to America with a cross community group. The heat in Asia was a massive shock.Having grown up in a rented manse on the Rademon estate, Richard swapped a quiet rural existence for the hustle and bustle of the global port and major commerce centre. It was still under British rule and would remain so for another three years before it was handed back to China.Richard said: ldquoLanguage was the biggest shock but I made it my mission to learn the language and enrolled in YMCA lessons but also managed to pick it up from also working alongside locals.It wasnrsquot long before Richard felt confident enough to start out his own business, an electrical supply company which employed  staff.He said: ldquoI knew after the first few months that Hong Kong was going to work for me,you worked hard, nothing could hold you back, age was not an issue here. Opening a business here was very straight forward, just need a bank account and register an address.He met his we Mavis during his first month in the city and the two have been together ever since.They opened their first store in  in the after seeing a large amount of good furniture being thrown away each week and were determined to do something that would reduce the waste and help the environment. Within months, they had outgrown this store and relocated to their current , sq ft premises in Tuen Mun.The couple has recently opened a second, , sq ft premises in Chai Wan which is closer to the busy capital.Fluent in Cantonese for many years, Richard has seen Hong Kong go through many challenges, not in the least with the recent coronavirus pandemic.ldquoHong Kong has handled the virus very well, having been through SARS and bird flu before, said Richard. ldquoAs soon as we heard there was an issue over the border in China, Hong Kong went straight into prevention measures before even being advised to. Now everyone wears masks and observes hygiene measures.The preventative measures must have been successful as the city recorded zero deaths on Monday for the first time since the outbreak before Christmas.While the move to Hong Kong was the right one for Richard, he still misses home and his brothers and sisters, Simon, Gillian, Laura and William.He said: ldquoI miss the food, the greenery and, of course, my family who are all still in Northern Ireland. I miss being close to home as I have lost family members and grandparents.ldquoBut we come home as often as we can. Mavis and the kids love Crossgar, especially AJs Diner. They love the Rademon estate where we lived beside, walks down the Church Road to Kilmore and the open green fields. We have very few here in Hong Kong and any we do have are full of mosquitos.Home is always on Richardrsquos mind, as is his business.He adds: ldquoNext for our business is hopefully more expansion as I would like to start exporting furniture to other countries such as Northern Ireland.

Mr James said bluntly yesterday:ldquoThere are people who had an opportunity to say things at an early stage but did not. Now they have really pulled the carpet out from under our feet at an advanced stage. Irsquom bitterly disappointed at this kind of timing.The problem arose when the Housing Executive was in the final stages of preparing a scheme, which has been on the drawing board for several years, when it was told of the Government objections to a number of potential sites, including the Burren River catchment area and another, the most important, at the Dundrum Road end of the town.The Executive had finally got an agreement to purchase from the landowner of the Dundrum Road site and had made a final routine check with the Government departments before clinching a deal.

It is also my understanding that Newry, Mourne and Down Council and Northern Irelandrsquos other  councils are working closely alongside the government department at this time.Cllr Walker said he would like to see the recycling centres open again, suggesting that strict controls could be introduced to only allow two vehicles access them at any one time.ldquoI would also appeal to people at this time to keep their waste until the recycling centres are open again. I appreciate that many people who are not at work at the moment are making the most of the time they have to clean out their homes, sheds and garages and I commend them for being active.ldquoHowever, it simply isnrsquot on to load up you car with waste, drive to a secluded area and dump it. I just donrsquot understand the mentality of people who engage in this kind of behaviour.Cllr Walker also said the cost of clearing up illegal waste is borne by the districtrsquos ratepayers.ldquoWe have the ironic situation that those who dump their waste illegally end up paying for its removal viatheir rates. This beggars belief, he declared. ldquoThe stupidity of those who dump waste in secluded areas is beyond me.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe time has come for common sense and people really need to catch a grip of themselves. One of the most worrying aspectsof illegal dumping is that waste which ends up in fields is sometimes eatenby livestock which often results in deadly consequences. To those who dump their waste illegal my appeal is stop now.The local council has confirmed that it is receiving increasing reports about fly-tipping across the district since the start of the COVID- crisis. But the organisation insists that it is currently able to manage the issue within existing resources.A council spokesman said that the organisation continues to work closely with the Environment Agency which also performs a key role in addressing incidents of larger illicit dumping.On the issue of reopening the districtrsquos household recycling centres, the spokesman explained that the decision is continually being reviewed in line with government social distancing measures.He continued: ldquoFly-tipping is illegal and the council will strictly enforce this where evidence can be gathered. Responding to fly-tipping incidents also erts important council resources away from providing other essential services.The spokesman confirmed that the council is unable to remove illicitly-dumped waste from privately-owned land, explaining that where this occurs, both it and the Environment Agency has the legal powers to request its removal.He said the council will enforce this where required.The spokesman added: ldquoThe council would urge the public to avoid producing any unnecessary waste, including undertaking DIY and house and garden clearances at this time due to the considerable pressure being placed on public services.ldquoAny additional waste that is produced should be stored for future disposal at the household recycling centres once they re-open.

Here, he selects his greatest Down team of all timeHIS name alone is enough to rekindle treasured memories of a time when Down football reigned supreme.Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty had the deadliest left foot in Ireland and he used it to maximum effect as Down swept all before them.Incredibly, itrsquos  years ago that Down took the sporting world by storm when they defeated Kerry to win the All-Ireland senior football title for the first time. It was also the first time that a team north of the border had won the Sam Maguire Cup.To reinforce their emergence as a new power in Gaelic football, Down retained their title the following year with Paddy as captain of the side which defeated Offaly and he was also a member of the Down team which won a third All-Ireland for the county in , Kerry again falling victim to the Red and Black machine in the final.As well as his three All-Ireland medals, Paddy won seven Ulster Championship, seven Railway Cup and three National League medals.

If we had not beaten them, they would have won another three All-Irelands.Asked how his Down team would fare against present day sides ldquoItrsquos a dferent game now, what with the blanket defence and other things, but the Down teams of the s would have won in any era. Well, thatrsquos what I think, though Irsquom sure there are many people who would disagree. Eddie McKay Eddie won two All-Ireland medals with me in  and . He was a very good goalkeeper believe me, always safe, dependable and brave. He was an excellent shot stopper and made many excellent saves. I also played against him many times when Ballykinlar took on Dundrum. These were local parish derbies and everyone was trying to kill each other, but somehow Dundrum never managed to beat us. George Lavery George also won two All-Irelands in  and . He was the quiet man on the team, but there were few better man markers in the game and he would have been a star in any era. He had played a match of two for Antrim, but Maurice Hayes, who was secretary of the Down county board, persuaded him to sign for Down. He played as sweeper and was a good, tight marker. Leo Murphy Leo was a terric full back, tough and reliable. Not too many players could get past him and he could kick the ball a long distance. He also won two All-Irelands in  and . Pat Rice There was no one better than Pat Rice at catching a ball. His high fielding was magnicent and he was quick at clearing the ball. He gave away few chances and often kicked the ball out for Eddie McKay. He missed little and he wasnrsquot a dirty player at all. Dan McCartan One of only three Down players to win three All-Ireland senior medals along with Sean OrsquoNeill, Joe Lennon and myself, Dan is one of the all-time greats of Down football. He had outstanding ability, tackled hard and always looked for the quick clearance up to the front men. He could play anywhere as he showed when he moved to full back in the  final. Joe Lennon He was our captain in , though he did not play in the second after getting injured. He was a great captain and a terric leader. Joe placed a great emphasis on fitness and pioneered new coaching practices. He thought greatly about the game and was possibly ahead of his time. He was a very talented player. Tom OrsquoHare Tom played in the  team, but was good enough to get his place on any team. He was probably one of our best players that year. He was always steady and was great at delivering a ground ball. Jarlath Carey Jarlath won two All-Irelands in  and . He was a tireless worker, who was at home either in midfield or in attack. He was always forcing his way into the forward line and would wag his finger at me to go back into midfield to cover for him. I didnrsquot mind one bit, because he was good enough and I was fit enough to do what he asked. Colm McAlarney They called Colm lsquoThe Mighty Arklersquo after the famous racehorse because of his long strides up the field. Colm and Tom OrsquoHare were our two outstanding players in  and Colm was definitely one of the best midfielders in Ireland at that time, or any other time. Tony Hadden Tony won two All-Irelands in  and . He could fist the ball further than many players could kick it and he could also move into midfieldthings were going bad. He was tall and well built and could score a point as well as anyone. James McCartan A very strong player. Down would not have won anything without him because he took a lot of the abuse which would otherwise have been directed at me or Sean OrsquoNeill. He played a critical role in the  final against Offaly. We were two goals down in the first half and getting beaten. I crossed the ball to James who turned in mid air and put into the back of the net. Two more goals from Sean OrsquoNeill and Breen Morgan had us a goal up at half time, but it was his goal that turned things around. Sean OrsquoNeill You would have to say that Sean was the greatest Down footballer of them all. He was named in the GAA Team of the Century which says it all. We played well together, wherever I kicked the ball, Sean was there to get it. He had a wonderful sidestep and took a lot of abuse, but he never retaliated. He went on to become a successful manager and won the Sigerson Cup with Queenrsquos University. Mickey Linden Mickey was a flying machine and one of Downrsquos best ever forwards. He could blow defences away with his pace and score with either foot. He was also very versatile. You could play him anywhere and he would still be a threat. Perhaps his only failing was that he was too nice a player. He rarely made a foul. Won two All-Irelands in  and . Patsy OrsquoHagan Full forward and winner of two All-Irelands in  and . He could have played full forward, full back, or just about anywhere . He was that good. One of his best performances was Wembley Stadium during one of the Wembley Cup tournaments when he scored four goals against Galway. Breen Morgan They made them tough in Annaclone and for his size Breen was one of the hardest men on the field. He had broken his jaw before the  All-Ireland final, but went to the field without the protector which was made specially for him. He just threw it on to a chair. He was marked by Offalyrsquos Paddy McCormick, who was made of iron, but Breen was afraid of no one.Paddyrsquos substitutesDanny Kelly , Greg Blaney , Barry Breen , James Milligan , Ross Carr , Paddy OrsquoRourke , DJ Kane , Dan Gordon , Benny Coulter , Paddy Doherty ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 Queen.jpg","title":"Queen Karen Europe’s best  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH grandmother is a European powerlting champion at the age of .Karen Burns won the European title in France in March and set a new world record in the process.Powerlting involves three disciplines mdash squat, bench press and deadlt mdash and Karen capped a brilliant performance with a world record breaking lt of  kilos in the deadlt.Itrsquos a fantastic achievement for Karen, who only took up powerlting four years ago.The legal secretary, who has two daughters and four grandchildren, started gym classes at the age of , but within a few months made the switch to powerlting.Coached by Aaron Kelly, from Affinity Fit at the CG Fitness gym in Annacloy, she trained four times a week and was soon competing and winning medals at a national, international and world levels.She was the British champion two years running in  and .

This would be known as Serious Condition Criteria.While widely welcomed, what was not made clear was Departmental staff have discretion around who meets criteria and can overrule a claimantrsquos medical evidence.A number of enquiries were submitted to the Department under a Freedom of Information request.The responses are concerning.The Department stated legislation does not refer to serious conditions but rather whether there is a relevant change of circumstances. The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who are unlikely to ever move into work: ldquoTook effect from  September , but did not result in legislative change.The Department was asked about the right of appealing a decision rejecting a claimant for Serious Conditions Criteria, who responded: ldquoThere is no automatic right of appeal against a determination which is embodied in or necessary to a decision. , a claimant has a right of appeal against an outcome decision rather than a determination, which is merely a component of the outcome decision.This was complicated for non-legally trained or represented claimants, so questions were put around full compliance with the Disability Discrimination and Human Rights.The Department responded stating it: ldquoDoes not hold any information relating to this hellip.may have been undertaken by DWP.A copy of the risk-assessment template used by the Department in instances of considering Serious Condition Criteria, was requested, but: ldquoNo template existsInstead, the response referred to assessment procedures where Departmental Healthcare Professionals advise on the re-referral period, and consider whether a claimantrsquos condition meets: ldquoThe new severe conditions criteria andno further assessments are required.However, the claimantrsquos own medical professionalrsquos opinion around Serious Condition Criteria could be over-ruled, with this decided by: ldquoAn Administrative Officer appointed by the Department.In respect of providing the legislation or guidance which permits the Department to overrule clinical opinion provided by a claimant seeking consideration under the Serious Condition Criteria, the response referred to ESA Regulations , which: ldquoProvides for the redetermination of whether someone has limited capability for work. The time period in relation to this is not set down in the legislation but is largely at the Department Decision Makers discretion ndash usually based on available medical evidence including medical reports from ATOS hellip The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who would be unlikely to ever move into work, took effect from  September  but did not result in legislative change.As the Freedom of Information request was answerd prior to the restoration of devolution, the Department was asked with a Minister now in post, to comment on current processes around Serious Condition Criteria decision-making and in particular, how it can by discretion supersede a medical diagnosis by a claimantrsquos clinician. It was also askedprocedures are under review andthere is intention to bring forward legislation to allow for scrutiny or challenge.A spokesperson said: ldquo Anyone claiming ESA will be automatically assessed for the Severe Conditions criteria at their Work Capability Assessment by a Healthcare Professional. If the personrsquos condition or its al effects meet the criteria, the Department will be advised that no further assessments are required.In response to the overruling of clinical decisions, the spokesperson said: ldquoThe Work Capability Assessment looks at the al effects of a personrsquos condition, rather than the diagnosis itself. It is not a supersession of the opinion of their clinician.This dfered to the response provided prior to the Minister taking office, which appeared to show the Department was permitted to over-rule the evidence of claimantrsquos clinician.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Itrsquos a place, not a thing.ldquoWe were making decisions the scientists and medical experts were making decisions at that time and planning was going on. This is the point to judge it now when we have two months more evidence is dangerous and a misleading thing to do.Turning to PPE which has been an issue in Fermanagh, Mr. Lewis used his own constituency of Great Yarmouth as an example of where there has been ldquono problems with accessing equipment.He added: ldquoWersquove had gowns sent over to the UK, OrsquoNeills [sportswear] converted to gowns, there is gin distillery in your part of the world producing sanitisers.ldquoWersquore shting five and a half million pieces of PPE across to Northern Ireland.

I am talking to the first minster every day that.Mr. Lewis said the priority of the United Kingdom government is to make sure ldquowe donrsquot hit the second peak of the virus.ldquoOne of the most damaging things economically would be, as well as health wise, to start coming out of lockdown ndash restaurants, pubs, whatever start opening again ndash and suddenly you have to close down again and thatrsquos not viable.ldquoI think itrsquos right to be cautious about this wersquoll make that decision in a few weeks.ldquoThe science is shting on this the experience is changing. I am cautious about predicting what will be in a few weeksrsquo time.He believes the government could ldquoflatten the curve of Covid-people continue to stay at home, adding: ldquoWe want to see past the peak, you donrsquot want to see a downward trend and ease up as all you do is let it shoot back up again.ldquoIf you think back to the beginning there were some quite scary numbers being put about by some experts about what the deaths might be. Now any death is too many and we have sadly lost people, friends and family who have gone through tragic experiences recently, and the figures are nowhere near those numbers we saw at the beginning.ldquoThatrsquos because the public across Northern Ireland and the UK have done a good job generally of following the guidelines which means we can flatten that curve, he said.Mr. Lewis explained that he had personal experience of people close to him who had been diagnosed with Covid-, including his parliamentary private secretary.ldquoSomeone I know lost a member of their family this week, I have a few people in family who had the disease.

I’ve done half marathons but never a full marathon.“The London Marathon is still going ahead in October, but I thought it would be nice to have something on that day to mark the day I would have done it.“The new date is two days after my wedding, hopefully it all still goes ahead.

Attempting to run  laps of the driveway outside his home in Islington, north London, Ryan is undertaking this challenge in response to local charities’ appeals for help during the pandemic: “I was sitting at home thinking, ‘what can I do ’ It’s devastating to think that all those local charities that do incredible work, day-in, day-out, are now finding themselves without the necessary funding unable to provide the vital services that they do. “Marie Curie, in particular, is a cause close to my heart, so I couldn’t bear to see them struggling. I walked outside and measured the distance between the top and bottom of our road which is .km. After some quick maths I realised  laps would equal the distance of a marathon.” The official London Marathon was due to take place this Sunday, however Ryan was not set to run the race himself: “I haven’t been training for the . miles distance – in fact, I’ve done zero training for this – which perhaps doesn’t leave me best prepared, but the thought of those in the care of the amazing Marie Curie nurses will spur me on, as will the memory of my mum and aunt Eileen.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusCountry and FarmingFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Please try again later.Submitting...Make sure your dog has a comfy bed or den, where they can relax in peace.Give them something fun to occupy them, such as a long-lasting treat or puzzle toy.While your dog is enjoying their treat, take a couple of steps to the other side of the room. If your dog stays where they are, wait a moment, then go back and reward them with an extra treat.Increase the distance you move away and the time you wait before ing with the extra treat. You should soon be able to leave the room and close the door or gate. Progress to spending more time in a dferent room. Build this into the daily routine.It’s important that your dog remains relaxed. If they show signs of distress, leave them for a shorter period, or don’t move as far away, next time.Rachel Casey, Director of Canine Behaviour and Research at Dogs Trust, said: “For many of us it has been great to spend so much time with our dogs during lockdown andmostly our dogs love us being around too. But all this extra attention could potentially create a ticking time bomb of separation anxiety for our dogs. If they expect us to be about all the time, it will be more dficult for them to cope once we go back to our normal lives and aren’t in the house  .“Now is the time to act to avoid future problems – and it’s easy to do. Just make sure that you factor in time apart from your dog each day to help them be able to cope when alone – this could be separated from you by a door or child gate for an hour or two whilst you’re working or home schooling the kids. By organizing your dog’s day, with time apart, play times, exercise, other activity sessionsand quiet times, you can make sure that your dog maintains their ability to cope with the dferent aspects of ‘normal’ le when we get back to it.”For more ideas on how to keep your dog occupied visit www.dogstrust.org.uk--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Providing that people continue to be generous then there wonrsquot be a problem.As increasing numbers of people self-isolate to protect themselves from the virus, Claire said that the food bank was able to offer deliveriesnecessary.ldquoWe are a very open foodbank. If yoursquove got a need, just ask and we can do our best, said Claire.After the Church in Wales announced the suspension of public acts of worship, the Tabernacle and other churches in Penarth have been finding innovative ways to support their congregation.ldquoFrom this weekend we are going to be streaming virtual services, said Clair.ldquoOur musicians are recording pieces in their homes which will be shared online.ldquoAll our small groups meet on Zoom so wersquore in touch with our congregation.ldquoThe more elderly congregations are keeping in touch by phone and telephone to support them in every way ndash spiritually, emotionally and practically.ldquoThe epidemic is pulling everybody together and cutting across denominational boundaries.The Tabernacle Foodbank is open for donations and collections between am and pm Monday to Friday.You can also deliver donations to their collection point in Sainsburyrsquos on Windsor Road.The foodbank would particularly welcome tinned products, including curry, chilli, corned beef, and potatoes.For more information, visit: Info@tabspenarth or call:  . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If your dog stays where they are, wait a moment, then go back and reward them with an extra treat.Increase the distance you move away and the time you wait before ing with the extra treat. You should soon be able to leave the room and close the door or gate. Progress to spending more time in a dferent room. Build this into the daily routine.It’s important that your dog remains relaxed. If they show signs of distress, leave them for a shorter period, or don’t move as far away, next time.Rachel Casey, Director of Canine Behaviour and Research at Dogs Trust, said: “For many of us it has been great to spend so much time with our dogs during lockdown andmostly our dogs love us being around too. But all this extra attention could potentially create a ticking time bomb of separation anxiety for our dogs. If they expect us to be about all the time, it will be more dficult for them to cope once we go back to our normal lives and aren’t in the house  .“Now is the time to act to avoid future problems – and it’s easy to do. Just make sure that you factor in time apart from your dog each day to help them be able to cope when alone – this could be separated from you by a door or child gate for an hour or two whilst you’re working or home schooling the kids. By organizing your dog’s day, with time apart, play times, exercise, other activity sessionsand quiet times, you can make sure that your dog maintains their ability to cope with the dferent aspects of ‘normal’ le when we get back to it.”For more ideas on how to keep your dog occupied visit www.dogstrust.org.uk--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
