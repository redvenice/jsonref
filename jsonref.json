Only three bodies of the kids have been foundLast month, officials said Jennifer Hart was drunk when she drove her large family off a cliff and her wife and several children had large amounts of a drug in their systems that can cause drowsiness.   Sarah Hart, along with at least two of the children, had \u0027significant\u0027 amounts of an ingredient found in Benadryl in their systems. Her blood alcohol content at the time of the crash was .102. Investigators have reason to believe the crash was intentional. Five members of the Hart family, parents Sarah  and Jennifer Hart and their adopted children Markis, Jeremiah and Abigail Hart, were dead inside the wrecked SUV.No one in the car was wearing a seat belt. On April 7, a bystander pulled a body from the surf near the site of the crash.  In this March 29, 2018, photo, Deputy Bill Holcomb looks down the cliff near the crash site near Mendocino, Calif., as search and rescue volunteers looked for the missing childrenThe body was later identified through DNA analysis as 12-year-old Ciera Hart.There are still two missing children, 15-year-old Devonte and 16-year-old Hannah.Police have said that data from the vehicle\u0027s software also suggested the crash was deliberate. Hart family\u0027s SUV was about 70 feet from the cliff\u0027s edge when Jennifer accelerated. She was driving somewhere between 20 to 30 mph when the car went off the cliff. They said the SUV had stopped at a coastal highway overlook before speeding straight off the cliff and plummeting 100 feet into the rocky Pacific Ocean below.The crash happened just days after authorities in Washington state opened an investigation following allegations the children were being neglected.KATU News has reported on a number of other incidents involving the Hart family that eventually led to an investigation by Washington State Child Protective Services.In 2017, one of the Hart children jumped out of a second-story window and begged her neighbors for help. She said her parents were racist, abusive and whipped her.In the weeks leading up to the crash, Devonte Hart went to his neighbor\u0027s house several times asking for food saying his parents were punishing him and not allowing him to eat.In 2013, a family friend said she \u0027witnessed what I felt to be controlling emotional abuse and cruel punishment\u0027 toward the six children.Sarah Hart pleaded guilty to a domestic assault charge in Minnesota in 2011. Her plea also led to the dismissal of a charge of malicious punishment of a child.One of her daughters, who was 6 years old at the time, showed her teacher she had bruising all over her back and torso.In 2008 in another report claimed Jennifer beat her daughter using a belt. When confronted by officials, Jennifer and Sarah Hart said the little girl was misbehaving, and added she likely got her bruises from falling down the stairs."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/10/22/4C12632B00000578-5715701-image-a-2_1525989343225.jpg","title":"Dashboard cam captures duty deputy save babys life","story":"    This is the moment an off-duty deputy saved a baby\u0027s life after being flagged down by a woman for help          Distraught mom Nechole Crowell flagged down K9 Deputy Jeremie Nix in Ocala on Wednesday around 5:30pm          Crowell rushed out of the vehicle with baby King and another woman got out of the driver\u0027s seat to assistWhen the officer wasn\u0027t noticing an improvement in King\u0027s breathing, he hurried back into his vehicle and took off to the nearby Ocala Regional Medical Center.The Marion County Sheriff\u0027s Office shared heartwarming updates about baby King\u0027s state afterward.\u0027Deputy Nix delivered the child to medical personnel, who then began treating the child.

Indeed, he claims to have won an award for Best Gay Solo Video in 1997. Rex uses the reclining naked photograph on his Twitter home page where he also likes to post crude jokes. In a reference to engagement rings, he wrote the other day: ‘The bigger the diamond, the smaller the d***.’Elsewhere there is a picture of him posing in a Coca-Cola costume carrying the caption: ‘I think I have a coke problem.’All in all, he seems the unlikeliest of romances for Ms Markle. But according to the Sun newspaper, the two enjoyed a date in 2004 when Meghan was 22 and taking her very first steps as a professional actress with walk-on parts in daytime television.          Simon Rex of Dirt Nasty performs at the world famous Roxy theater in Los Angeles, CA          Simon \u0027Dirt Nasty\u0027 Rex (centre) arrives at the grand opening of the Sapphire Pool \u0026amp Day Club on May 3, 2013 in Las Vegas, NevadaThey are said to have met on the set of a long-forgotten U.S. sitcom called Cuts when they both had roles in the same episode.He was already a successful model appearing in ads for Calvin Klein, Versace and Levi’s while Meghan was still a year away from her first regular-money role as a ‘briefcase girl’ — holding up a case full of cash — on game show Deal Or No Deal.Of his past as a porn star — he was 18 and 19 when he made the films — he says it was to pay the bills.‘I went there and did that s***,’ he said in a 2014 interview. ‘It was just enough to pay the rent at the time. I was living in the moment.’He added: ‘In hindsight, it wasn’t the best move.’For Meghan, Rex’s moment of regret will barely register. Instead, any lingering hopes she may have had that her past life would remain off limits as she completes her transformation from Hollywood starlet to royal princess must surely now have vanished.If it’s any comfort, the Royal Family will scarcely raise an eyebrow at the revelations. As one figure close to the Royals told me: ‘It’s a horrid little betrayal, but it won’t damage her reputation. She’s not a virginal bride like Diana, who was only just out of her teens when she married Charles, but a mature woman of experience with one failed marriage behind her.’  Paris Hilton and Simon Rex at the premiere of the \u0027Layer Cake\u0027 film in January 2005 (left). Paris Hilton and Simon Rex on the set of Pledge This! in Miami, Florida in August 2004The disclosures have come from Ninaki Priddy, once an inseparable friend of Meghan to whom she had been ‘like a sister’. But their relationship is long over. Since Meghan’s engagement to Harry she has spilled just about every intimate bean of their 30-year friendship.It was Ms Priddy, you may recall, who revealed to royal biographer Andrew Morton that Meghan ‘was always fascinated by the Royal Family. She wants to be Princess Diana 2.’ Yet what emerges from these revelations is a picture of Meghan who, as a young woman, was not quite the confident and sophisticated figure whom Harry fell in love with. Meghan was vulnerable and as likely as any other twentysomething to chance her luck in the dating stakes.Until now it had been thought that, for all her beauty, Meghan had been linked to only a handful of men, apart from her former husband, film producer Trevor Engelson and the Canadian chef who replaced him in her affections.There had been the boy with whom she shared a first kiss, a high-school sweetheart, and a couple of others, none serious. But now we learn that she had a dating bible called The Rules, a self-help book aimed at women who want ‘marriage in the shortest time possible’. Meghan studied the book — an instant bestseller when it came out in the mid-Nineties — so thoroughly she was able to recite passages off by heart.    Interestingly, Meghan was also linked to another American who worked at the embassy. Or at least those are the rumours in the Argentine capitalInterestingly, Meghan was also linked to another American who worked at the embassy. Or at least those are the rumours in the Argentine capital.Looking back, it does seem these men were little more than footfalls in her romantic history. By 2004, she was with TV producer Engelson. In 2010, they were engaged and wed the following year, to separate two years later.Ms Priddy claims that her friend had put ‘all The Rules into play with Trevor’.She had apparently met a fortune teller in Argentina who told her she would marry a man with ‘curly red hair’. Engelson, of course is not the only figure in her life to have reddish hair. So, too, does Prince Harry.Next week she will have pushed the far-from-welcome disclosures to the back of her mind as family and friends see them marry.Her old friend Ninaki will not be there. She did not make the guest list.  The rule book secrets that helped her bewitch a Prince For every young girl who dreams of growing up and marrying a handsome Prince, there is one burning question. How did Meghan do it?Just how did this 36-year-old American orcee and small-screen actress capture the eye of Prince Harry?Now we know the answer. One of her childhood friends, Ninaki Priddy, this week said Meghan swore by a self-help book called The Rules: Time-tested Secrets For Capturing The Heart Of Mr Right.Although a bestseller, the book came in for criticism over its anti-feminist message. It advises women to be subservient, let the man to lead the conversation and to never, ever sleep with him until you’ve had at least three dates.There’s also a chapter on how to attract a high-profile man — along with other rules Meghan may have found useful . . .SNARING YOUR VIPWhat follows are The Rules for meeting and dating celebrities and business bigwigs. Assuming the VIP spoke to you first, here’s what to do and what not to do:1. Take a deep breath. Stay composed.2. Treat him as you would any other man, not the movie star or business tycoon he is.3. Do not stare at him4. Do not light up or act giddy, as if you just won the lottery.5. Act as if you’ve been out of the country for the last three years and you’re not quite sure who he is, even if he was just on the cover of People magazine.6. Don’t ask for his autograph.7. Don’t compliment him.8. Don’t show any interest in his career.9. If you’re an aspiring actress, do not ask for an audition.10. Do not ask him to do you a favour, such as donate money to your favourite charity.11. Act interested but not spellbound. Leave him alone. After five minutes of conversation about whatever he wants to talk about, say: ‘Oh, look at the time, I must leave now. It was nice meeting you.’ And walk away.12. Do not seem impressed by his limousine or entourage.13. Once you are dating a celebrity, don’t see him whenever and wherever it’s convenient for him because he has a busy schedule. 14. It’s tempting to drop your friends and family and revolve your whole life around this famous man. You must still live your own life, see him two to three times a week — until he proposes.15. If he’s widely popular, expect that other women might write to him, call him and throw themselves at him. Do not get angry or show jealousy or insecurity. Do not be possessive in public. If he pursued you, their advances won’t matter. He’ll still want you.16. Be discreet. Do not call the tabloids and tell them you’re dating, as a way of announcing to other women that he’s your man. That would be self-serving, possibly hurtful or embarrassing to him, and might ruin any chances of his continuing to see you.17. Don’t try to become too friendly with his staff in an effort to keep tabs on him or so they put in a good word for you.18. Don’t seem overly interested in his wealth or the limelight. Rules girls are not groupies.DON’T RUSH INTO SEXYou will have to exercise a bit of self-restraint and trust that if you hold off for a few weeks or months you won’t be sorry. Why risk having a man call you easy?It can be excruciating to put off sex with someone you’re attracted to but you must think long-term.Let’s say that now, hopefully, you’ve held off for a while and are ready to have sex with him.What Rules should you follow? First and foremost, stay emotionally cool no matter how hot the sex gets. The fact is that most women turn men off not only because they sleep with them too soon, but because they talk too much about it in bed.Don’t be a drill sergeant, demanding he do that or this. Being with you in bed should not be difficult or demanding.Don’t cling to him if he has to leave that night or the following morning.Be casual and unmoved about the fact the date is over — with that attitude chances are that he’ll be the one hanging on.LONG-DISTANCE LOVEHaving been introduced to someone who lives in a different city or country, Rules apply to making it work:Don’t call him. He calls you. Get off the phone in 20 minutes. If he wants to visit you on the weekend, he must ask you by Wednesday.If he suggests that you meet in his city, or halfway, say: ‘That sounds nice, but things are really hectic right now, I just couldn’t get away.’ He’ll realise that he has to visit you. If you travel to see him before he’s made at least three trips to see you, he won’t think you’re special, and will not pursue you in the future. The first three times he visits, he should not stay with you. The first three visits are really three dates . . . and on the first three dates we don’t have sex.The first three times, always see a little less of him than he would like. If he suggests flying in Friday night and leaving Sunday evening, say Saturday morning would be better and end on Sunday afternoon.After he has visited you three times, you can visit him once and stay at his place. If he offers to pay your travel costs, let him. If he doesn’t, don’t ask for the money but let him pay for everything when you’re there. If things get serious, he might ask if you would ever consider relocating.Until he actually gives you a ring, be vague. There’s no reason to relocate until you’ve set a wedding date.CLOSING THE DEALIf you have been following the Rules you will not only get a proposal but you will know where the relationship is going long before he pops the question. You will sense a warm, open feeling emanating from him, a desire to include you in his world.The way to get a man to ask you to marry him in a reasonable amount of time is not to live with him before you’re engaged, and to continue to see him only three times a week. There’s no cold feeling in Rules engagements. He’s made his decision, he wants to get married, to be with you all the time, for ever.The Complete Book Of Rules by Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneider published by Thorson Element at £9.99 © Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneider 2000."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/10/23/4C114B8900000578-5715915-image-a-55_1525990941928.jpg","title":"QUENTIN LETTS similarities President BoJo","story":"If the similarities between U.S. President Trump (left) and our Foreign Secretary (right) were not already strong enough, this week Boris, on a visit to the States, posed for a photograph with the President’s daughter Ivanka  Don’t tie me down: Wind plays havoc with neckwear, but they’re more worried about what’s going on up top  Clowning about: Both like their grub, are poor listeners and bad at detail.

She was driving somewhere between 20 to 30 mph when the car went off the cliff. They said the SUV had stopped at a coastal highway overlook before speeding straight off the cliff and plummeting 100 feet into the rocky Pacific Ocean below.The crash happened just days after authorities in Washington state opened an investigation following allegations the children were being neglected.KATU News has reported on a number of other incidents involving the Hart family that eventually led to an investigation by Washington State Child Protective Services.In 2017, one of the Hart children jumped out of a second-story window and begged her neighbors for help. She said her parents were racist, abusive and whipped her.In the weeks leading up to the crash, Devonte Hart went to his neighbor\u0027s house several times asking for food saying his parents were punishing him and not allowing him to eat.In 2013, a family friend said she \u0027witnessed what I felt to be controlling emotional abuse and cruel punishment\u0027 toward the six children.Sarah Hart pleaded guilty to a domestic assault charge in Minnesota in 2011.

Indeed, he claims to have won an award for Best Gay Solo Video in 1997. Rex uses the reclining naked photograph on his Twitter home page where he also likes to post crude jokes. In a reference to engagement rings, he wrote the other day: ‘The bigger the diamond, the smaller the d***.’Elsewhere there is a picture of him posing in a Coca-Cola costume carrying the caption: ‘I think I have a coke problem.’All in all, he seems the unlikeliest of romances for Ms Markle. But according to the Sun newspaper, the two enjoyed a date in 2004 when Meghan was 22 and taking her very first steps as a professional actress with walk-on parts in daytime television.          Simon Rex of Dirt Nasty performs at the world famous Roxy theater in Los Angeles, CA          Simon \u0027Dirt Nasty\u0027 Rex (centre) arrives at the grand opening of the Sapphire Pool \u0026amp Day Club on May 3, 2013 in Las Vegas, NevadaThey are said to have met on the set of a long-forgotten U.S. sitcom called Cuts when they both had roles in the same episode.He was already a successful model appearing in ads for Calvin Klein, Versace and Levi’s while Meghan was still a year away from her first regular-money role as a ‘briefcase girl’ — holding up a case full of cash — on game show Deal Or No Deal.Of his past as a porn star — he was 18 and 19 when he made the films — he says it was to pay the bills.‘I went there and did that s***,’ he said in a 2014 interview. ‘It was just enough to pay the rent at the time. I was living in the moment.’He added: ‘In hindsight, it wasn’t the best move.’For Meghan, Rex’s moment of regret will barely register. Instead, any lingering hopes she may have had that her past life would remain off limits as she completes her transformation from Hollywood starlet to royal princess must surely now have vanished.If it’s any comfort, the Royal Family will scarcely raise an eyebrow at the revelations. As one figure close to the Royals told me: ‘It’s a horrid little betrayal, but it won’t damage her reputation. She’s not a virginal bride like Diana, who was only just out of her teens when she married Charles, but a mature woman of experience with one failed marriage behind her.’  Paris Hilton and Simon Rex at the premiere of the \u0027Layer Cake\u0027 film in January 2005 (left). Paris Hilton and Simon Rex on the set of Pledge This! in Miami, Florida in August 2004The disclosures have come from Ninaki Priddy, once an inseparable friend of Meghan to whom she had been ‘like a sister’. But their relationship is long over. Since Meghan’s engagement to Harry she has spilled just about every intimate bean of their 30-year friendship.It was Ms Priddy, you may recall, who revealed to royal biographer Andrew Morton that Meghan ‘was always fascinated by the Royal Family. She wants to be Princess Diana 2.’ Yet what emerges from these revelations is a picture of Meghan who, as a young woman, was not quite the confident and sophisticated figure whom Harry fell in love with. Meghan was vulnerable and as likely as any other twentysomething to chance her luck in the dating stakes.Until now it had been thought that, for all her beauty, Meghan had been linked to only a handful of men, apart from her former husband, film producer Trevor Engelson and the Canadian chef who replaced him in her affections.There had been the boy with whom she shared a first kiss, a high-school sweetheart, and a couple of others, none serious. But now we learn that she had a dating bible called The Rules, a self-help book aimed at women who want ‘marriage in the shortest time possible’. Meghan studied the book — an instant bestseller when it came out in the mid-Nineties — so thoroughly she was able to recite passages off by heart.    Interestingly, Meghan was also linked to another American who worked at the embassy. Or at least those are the rumours in the Argentine capitalInterestingly, Meghan was also linked to another American who worked at the embassy. Or at least those are the rumours in the Argentine capital.Looking back, it does seem these men were little more than footfalls in her romantic history. By 2004, she was with TV producer Engelson. In 2010, they were engaged and wed the following year, to separate two years later.Ms Priddy claims that her friend had put ‘all The Rules into play with Trevor’.She had apparently met a fortune teller in Argentina who told her she would marry a man with ‘curly red hair’. Engelson, of course is not the only figure in her life to have reddish hair. So, too, does Prince Harry.Next week she will have pushed the far-from-welcome disclosures to the back of her mind as family and friends see them marry.Her old friend Ninaki will not be there. She did not make the guest list.  The rule book secrets that helped her bewitch a Prince For every young girl who dreams of growing up and marrying a handsome Prince, there is one burning question. How did Meghan do it?Just how did this 36-year-old American orcee and small-screen actress capture the eye of Prince Harry?Now we know the answer. One of her childhood friends, Ninaki Priddy, this week said Meghan swore by a self-help book called The Rules: Time-tested Secrets For Capturing The Heart Of Mr Right.Although a bestseller, the book came in for criticism over its anti-feminist message. It advises women to be subservient, let the man to lead the conversation and to never, ever sleep with him until you’ve had at least three dates.There’s also a chapter on how to attract a high-profile man — along with other rules Meghan may have found useful . . .SNARING YOUR VIPWhat follows are The Rules for meeting and dating celebrities and business bigwigs. Assuming the VIP spoke to you first, here’s what to do and what not to do:1. Take a deep breath. Stay composed.2. Treat him as you would any other man, not the movie star or business tycoon he is.3. Do not stare at him4. Do not light up or act giddy, as if you just won the lottery.5. Act as if you’ve been out of the country for the last three years and you’re not quite sure who he is, even if he was just on the cover of People magazine.6. Don’t ask for his autograph.7. Don’t compliment him.8. Don’t show any interest in his career.9. If you’re an aspiring actress, do not ask for an audition.10. Do not ask him to do you a favour, such as donate money to your favourite charity.11. Act interested but not spellbound. Leave him alone. After five minutes of conversation about whatever he wants to talk about, say: ‘Oh, look at the time, I must leave now. It was nice meeting you.’ And walk away.12. Do not seem impressed by his limousine or entourage.13. Once you are dating a celebrity, don’t see him whenever and wherever it’s convenient for him because he has a busy schedule. 14. It’s tempting to drop your friends and family and revolve your whole life around this famous man. You must still live your own life, see him two to three times a week — until he proposes.15. If he’s widely popular, expect that other women might write to him, call him and throw themselves at him. Do not get angry or show jealousy or insecurity. Do not be possessive in public. If he pursued you, their advances won’t matter. He’ll still want you.16. Be discreet. Do not call the tabloids and tell them you’re dating, as a way of announcing to other women that he’s your man. That would be self-serving, possibly hurtful or embarrassing to him, and might ruin any chances of his continuing to see you.17. Don’t try to become too friendly with his staff in an effort to keep tabs on him or so they put in a good word for you.18. Don’t seem overly interested in his wealth or the limelight. Rules girls are not groupies.DON’T RUSH INTO SEXYou will have to exercise a bit of self-restraint and trust that if you hold off for a few weeks or months you won’t be sorry. Why risk having a man call you easy?It can be excruciating to put off sex with someone you’re attracted to but you must think long-term.Let’s say that now, hopefully, you’ve held off for a while and are ready to have sex with him.What Rules should you follow? First and foremost, stay emotionally cool no matter how hot the sex gets. The fact is that most women turn men off not only because they sleep with them too soon, but because they talk too much about it in bed.Don’t be a drill sergeant, demanding he do that or this. Being with you in bed should not be difficult or demanding.Don’t cling to him if he has to leave that night or the following morning.Be casual and unmoved about the fact the date is over — with that attitude chances are that he’ll be the one hanging on.LONG-DISTANCE LOVEHaving been introduced to someone who lives in a different city or country, Rules apply to making it work:Don’t call him. He calls you. Get off the phone in 20 minutes. If he wants to visit you on the weekend, he must ask you by Wednesday.If he suggests that you meet in his city, or halfway, say: ‘That sounds nice, but things are really hectic right now, I just couldn’t get away.’ He’ll realise that he has to visit you. If you travel to see him before he’s made at least three trips to see you, he won’t think you’re special, and will not pursue you in the future. The first three times he visits, he should not stay with you. The first three visits are really three dates . . . and on the first three dates we don’t have sex.The first three times, always see a little less of him than he would like. If he suggests flying in Friday night and leaving Sunday evening, say Saturday morning would be better and end on Sunday afternoon.After he has visited you three times, you can visit him once and stay at his place. If he offers to pay your travel costs, let him. If he doesn’t, don’t ask for the money but let him pay for everything when you’re there. If things get serious, he might ask if you would ever consider relocating.Until he actually gives you a ring, be vague. There’s no reason to relocate until you’ve set a wedding date.CLOSING THE DEALIf you have been following the Rules you will not only get a proposal but you will know where the relationship is going long before he pops the question. You will sense a warm, open feeling emanating from him, a desire to include you in his world.The way to get a man to ask you to marry him in a reasonable amount of time is not to live with him before you’re engaged, and to continue to see him only three times a week. There’s no cold feeling in Rules engagements. He’s made his decision, he wants to get married, to be with you all the time, for ever.The Complete Book Of Rules by Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneider published by Thorson Element at £9.99 © Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneider 2000."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/10/23/4C114B8900000578-5715915-image-a-55_1525990941928.jpg","title":"QUENTIN LETTS similarities President BoJo","story":"If the similarities between U.S. President Trump (left) and our Foreign Secretary (right) were not already strong enough, this week Boris, on a visit to the States, posed for a photograph with the President’s daughter Ivanka  Don’t tie me down: Wind plays havoc with neckwear, but they’re more worried about what’s going on up top  Clowning about: Both like their grub, are poor listeners and bad at detail.

It is dull, thick, unpromising stuff. A muddy drawing sounds like a vague and boring one. Miraculously, however – or maybe just because he’s spent 50 years making art in and of the land – Richard Long’s huge new mud drawing Gravity Crescent is hypnotic, full of complex 3D curves that snare the eye.It looks as if eels are nesting in the wall. They writhe and wriggle, each tubular body created by a swerve of Long’s mud-stick. The raw wet earth with which he created this towering work, on a pristine white wall in London’s Lisson Gallery, comes from the river Avon, so perhaps the material is haunted by the river’s flashing, silver-scaled creatures. His muddy swirls mass in an engrossing swarm. The flow and life of the river seems caught in this whirlpool of mud.Gravity Crescent forms part of a vast unfinished circle. Below one section, muddy drips plummet like raindrops. The filled-in segment is crescent-shaped. Is it a croissant? Is it a piece of cake? No, it is the waxing moon. And beneath it, a stone circle fills the floor. It is a perfect disc, made simply by arranging radiating lines of rocks. Once again, Long’s feeling for nature lets him do something artistically magical. The stones are all flints. Their glistening white surfaces shine brightly, set off by flecks of black, to create a dazzling circle of light. It is the sun. Long’s installation is a cosmic picture of the two great discs in the sky. It is as if the megalithic builders of the stone age have set up shop at one of London’s top commercial galleries.Simple as it is, this astronomical installation sums up Long’s life in art. In 1967, when the consumer society was happily pumping out plastic and napalming nature, this young artist made a line across a field in England’s West Country by repeatedly walking backwards and forwards. It survives only as a photograph. It was no more intrusive in the landscape than the tracks badgers make. Ever since, Long has been walking the world, making and photographing ephemeral images. A photo here shows a circle he created in 2016 on a walk by the Amazon. All he did was press down the leaves of a plant to shape a circle on the ground. The rubbery leaves would have bounced back by the time he got his picture printed.What we see in this concentrated exhibition is the fruit of all those decades of meditative walks through great natural spaces. Long has clearly been musing on the lights in the sky. Like an early human, who has no idea that the sun is a star orbited by the Earth or that the moon is our satellite, he marvels at the magic discs that illuminate his journeys. Two wall texts summarise walks he made by the light of moon and sun. In one, he measures his paces from moonset to sunrise, from sunrise to moonset.  This modern primitive creates art in the same spirit that inspired our ancestors to lug bluestones from Wales to build Stonehenge which, like the works here, has the sun and moon in its sights – and, like Long’s circles, is precise in its geometry. Yet Long would not dream of creating anything as intrusively permanent as Stonehenge. He treads lightly in the landscape. As we watch the seasons getting confused, the Earth’s rhythms lost, the seas warming, he has a vision of rebalancing humanity and nature. Half an hour with his work in the middle of a riotous city is like lying in a meadow staring at the sky. Time slips and slows. The sound of a river patters nearby. Birds sing. The old stones warm in the sun. Richard Long not only shows you nature, he makes you feel part of it again. It is worth taking a walk with him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf6ea112d4ba46fa83d4409ba1ecf9742049e6d1/616_476_1744_1046/master/1744.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6feac68e0b8aed80137a06063cd73d6","title":"emily shur japan super extra natural","story":"Solitary smokers, dogs in the sunshine and stones in the snow are some of the luminous encounters in celebrity portraitist Emily Shur’s journeys across Japan"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e548d403df514a101d2d4cd91e8cce5cfec5678/0_77_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03692b1b6b49dbd020f025f2cbd2034e","title":"the photographer in the garden in pictures","story":"From famous locations to the simplest home vegetable garden, from worlds imagined by artists to vintage family snapshots, The Photographer in the Garden traces the garden’s rich history in photography"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3588c8273c034b97e235f4232974428307b44cf2/0_262_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab15e9b5abf4656f1c0db7e8d52ccffa","title":"how britain really works stig abell review","story":"People don’t know nearly as much as they think they do. Often, we don’t even know what we don’t even know. Many people are sure they understand parliamentary process, how a customs union works, or what goes on in schools, but when put on the spot find such things curiously hard to explain. What happens at a bill’s second reading? When would a person sit their Sats? These sound like pub quiz questions, but are surprisingly helpful in putting news in its proper context or\u0026nbspsimply understanding how the country ticks.To say that How Britain Really Works fills in some of these gaps runs the risk of making it sound dull when it’s a wry, readable, even whimsical book. (Sometimes a bit too whimsical the conceit of using the footnotes to add funny human stories rather than reference facts wears pretty thin.) Stig Abell’s aim was to come up with a modern, adult version of those children’s encyclopedias a pre-Google generation grew up dipping in and out of, a sort of Schott’s Miscellany of Britain. But while there’s an endearingly old-fashioned air to the idea of a book containing actual facts, rather than grand provocative theories about Britishness, it takes on an interestingly new light in an era of fake news.The combination of people who don’t know what they don’t know – and so may be dangerously overconfident about their ability to tell truth from fiction in the context of the type of political mendacity seen\u0026nbspduring the referendum campaign – along with a\u0026nbsptorrent of highly plausible, maliciously misleading information on social media, has not been a happy one. This book pulls off the difficult trick of being a\u0026nbsppotted primer to deeper issues behind the news – from economics and politics via health policy to how the media works – without being patronising or assuming too much knowledge.It doesn’t dig deep on any topic, dispatching two centuries of British political history in not much more than half a chapter, and current affairs junkies won’t find much in it that they genuinely didn’t know (or perhaps more accurately, didn’t think they knew). And\u0026nbspsince it’s written from the carefully even-handed viewpoint of a classic centrist dad, it’s not one for the radical in your life, either.But what is there is cleverly chosen and nicely put together, and it’s rather soothing to read something that isn’t angrily trying to sell you a big idea and then cherrypicking its facts to suit the polemic. If Abell has\u0026nbspa grand theory of Britishness, it would be that it’s\u0026nbspall a\u0026nbspbit of an agreeable muddle a series of polite fictions and happy or unhappy accidents that produce something that defies easy labelling. Oddly enough, it is a pretty good description in some ways of Abell himself, whose journalistic career s high\u0026nbspand lowbrow and has taken him from gamekeeper to poacher (he went from running the Press Complaints Commission to working as managing editor of the Sun, which brought him in after the phone-hacking scandal as it tried to show it was cleaning up its act, before becoming editor of the Times Literary Supplement).The sharpest chapter is perhaps the one on education. After a pithy analysis of how schools in the UK compare with those in the countries the UK is always lambasted for lagging behind – mainly the exam factories of Korea, Singapore and Japan – and of\u0026nbspcurrent challenges for education, Abell reaches his own uncompromising prescription: whack VAT on private schools, scrap grammars, abolish GCSEs in favour of one final exam at 18 and bring back maintenance grants for poorer university students.Elsewhere, he is rather more tentative. Abell had a ringside seat on the Leveson inquiry, having testified before it while at the PCC, and the chapter on the media is fascinating and more emotional than the rest of the book. He was clearly going through something of a dark night of the soul at this point during the inquiry he describes himself as “coming apart at\u0026nbspthe seams: working, going home to two young children, punching holes in\u0026nbspdoors with mute frustration” – so much so that his wife booked him an appointment with a psychiatrist, which he missed. But many readers will feel he still doesn’t address the perceived cosiness of the relationship\u0026nbspbetween press and regulator, or the woeful inability of the media to police itself.This slightly evasive quality is apparent elsewhere, particularly in the chapter endings which, with a few exceptions, elegantly avoid drawing much in the way\u0026nbspof conclusions.Yet the book remains a smart execution of an idea that is more important than it sounds – in a world convulsed by polarising ideologies and white-hot feelings, there is a lot to be said for writing that is cool and fact-based and, indeed, for having a rough idea of what you’re talking about.

But it’s no longer just the young condemned to housing insecurity: the number of 35- to 54-year-old private tenants has doubled in the space of a decade.In a society rigged in favour of landlords over tenants, to rent privately is to be deprived of security. There are now 1.8 million families renting privately – up from 600,000 in the early 2000s – and two-thirds of those wish their children weren’t in the private rented sector. Who can blame them? You can be asked to leave with little notice, and your rent can be arbitrarily increased, forcing you to make a choice between lowering your living standards further or the upheaval of finding somewhere else to live. That deprives you of a sense of stability, of setting down roots, of knowing your child doesn’t have to be bumped from school to school.Many families once enjoyed the security of a decent, genuinely affordable council house, but four in 10 of the council dwellings flogged off under right to buy are now owned by private landlords charging twice the rent. Here is the irony: the Tories promised that neoliberalism would deliver choice and a property-owning democracy. Instead, it has stripped away choice, compelling millions to settle for the insecurity of the private rented sector. It offered a temporary boost to home ownership, but many of the children of the beneficiaries of right to buy now find themselves paying up to half their salary to rent cramped flats.The Tories have built a system defined by insecurity – from wages to job contracts to housing to the welfare state. If they want to understand why socialism – long dead, never coming back, or so they thought – has undergone a revival, this is why. They believed they could get away with it if it was only the young who suffered: they’ll never vote, or so they comforted themselves. But as insecurity stalks the middle-aged, too, the Tories may discover that they have reared the gravediggers of their ideology."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e22217df9be1feb6a980dcea0c0d46c83c5bc5b2/0_776_3761_2257/master/3761.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6bf1b4128f538fb7eab3ca8d4fece8f","title":"experience i have been stung by 150 species of insect","story":"In my job, I have been stung countless times. But nothing comes close to the pain bullet ants inflictI carried out my first experiment with a stinging insect when I was seven, picking a honey bee off a dandelion and placing it on the arm of my teacher. My hypothesis was that it might sting her, and it turned out to be correct, much to her dismay.Where I grew up, in the Appalachian area of the north-east US, we had lots of honey bees and wasps of various sorts. As a kid, I was stung by virtually all of them. I realised that they registered the same sort of pain – the intensity may vary from one to the next, but they were fairly similar. But an accidental run-in with a colony of harvester ants led to a life-changing revelation: they didn’t feel at all as I expected they would. They really hurt.Twenty years on, working as a chemical ecologist, I was still fascinated by the defence mechanisms of wasps, bees and ants. As part of my job studying interactions between insects and their environment, I did fieldwork that involved collecting different species, providing endless opportunities to get stung. It occurred to me that while the venom could be analysed, it was harder to make comparisons between the type of pain each insect caused, which seemed crucial in understanding how and why different types of sting had evolved.Insects that live in areas with the greatest number of fierce predators tend to be the most aggressive, and their stings are the most potent. To test this, I came up with a pain index, where the level of discomfort is measured on a scale of one to four. Whenever I was stung, I would rate the pain, then write a description. At the lower end of the scale, a one, I put the sweat bee, which I describe as: “Light, ephemeral, almost fruity. A tiny spark has singed a single hair on your arm.” The twos include the yellowjacket wasp. “Hot and smoky, almost irreverent,” I wrote. The red harvester ant (“Bold and unrelenting. Somebody is using a drill to excavate your ingrown toenail,”) scores a three. But nothing comes close to the bullet ant. Some insects inflict similar levels of suffering in the short-term: the pain caused by tarantula hawk wasps lasts about two minutes warrior wasps, about an hour. But neither can manage the 24 hours of agony a bullet ant can deliver.My encounter with these queens of sting (only females have the ability to inflict pain) took place in Brazil. I was working with a field assistant tough enough to cup a wasp’s nest in his bare hands, but I couldn’t get him near the bullet ant colony. It was only when they started boiling out of the ground that I realised why. Before I knew it, they were on my finger, and I was stung. The pain slammed into me like a freight train, instant and overwhelming. I started to lose coordination and my hand wouldn’t stop shaking. In the index, I describe the pain as: “Pure, intense, brilliant… Like fire-walking over flaming charcoal with a three-inch rusty nail grinding into your heel.” Bullet ants got their name because their sting is said to be analogous to getting shot, but their venom isn’t designed to do long-term physical damage. Knowing that I just had to sweat it out, I retired to a bar, where I tried to ease the suffering with beer and ice. After 18 hours, I fell into an exhausted sleep.There have been other mishaps during my research. Once, while moving a colony of bees, I was stung 20 or 30 times on my hand, which swelled up like a hockey mitt. In Costa Rica, I had venom sprayed into my eyes by paper-nesting wasps while trying to remove their nest from a tree. It took several minutes of frantic blinking to restore my sight.If I am stung by an insect I have never encountered before, I still update the pain index, which was recently published in full for the first time – after 35 years, I have been stung by 150 species of insect and covered most that interest me.Family members love what I do – my wife has even performed Chinese folk songs celebrating stinging insects, and my son is always ready to go on adventures to seek out specimens. I know some people think me crazy, but I am no masochist, and only occasionally am stung on purpose. When it does happen, I initially react as anyone else would – cursing, more than I should admit. Then I get out my notebook and stopwatch, sit down and make notes.• As told to Chris Broughton. Do you have an experience to share?

And now a new study has concluded that for many bike riders, this is only too true: a sense of paranoia is a clinical reality.The research led by Lyn Ellet, a clinical psychology academic at Royal Holloway, University of London, studied 323 cyclists in London aged between 18-66, and used a series of questions to gauge their levels of paranoia when on a bike. In contrast, the study discovered, when measured for trait paranoia – how paranoid people are in general – the cyclists tended to show relatively low levels, and there was no apparent link between riders’ state and trait levels of paranoia.So, what is to blame for such strong feelings, summed up by one participant who is quoted in the study as saying: “I honestly view every driver as if he’s trying to kill me”?It’s seemingly down to the generally feral road conditions faced by cyclists in London (and, you could add, in most other places in the UK, not to mention other countries). The study puts it thus:The present research indicates that paranoia towards motor vehicle users may be common when cycling in London, and that far from being a pathological response, observed state paranoia is an understandable response to an urban environment containing significant and very real threat. The present findings reinforce and add a further dimension to the pressing public health need to focus on and protect urban cyclists. Highlighting this point, the study also looked into reported paranoia among travellers on London’s tube system, another transport method which has its negatives, though very rarely connected to a real personal threat to one’s safety.Here, the study said, state paranoia levels were notably lower, and there was a more general correlation between how paranoid people felt on the tube and their more general levels of paranoia.I fully understand these sentiments, though I perhaps feel a bit differently. I don’t generally think drivers are deliberately out to harm, harass or upset me – with the important caveat that this does very occasionally happen.Instead, what terrifies me is the lack of care, the casual approach to taking risks against a desperately vulnerable human on a bike by someone safely encased in a tonne of protective steel. This casual approach to others’ peril was eloquently expressed in the early 1950s by Alan Lennox-Boyd, at the time the transport minister in Winston Churchill’s government. He said: Accidents in the main arise from the taking of very small risks a very large number of times. A thousand-to-one chance against an accident may not be rated very high, but for every thousand people that take it there will be an accident.(As an aside it’s worth noting that several decades later, aged 78, Lennox-Boyd was killed by a car when trying to cross Fulham Road on foot. It’s not clear if the driver was taking one of those thousand-to-one chances, for example by speeding.)The vital point to stress is that pretty much everyone on the roads does take such risks, and often in several modes of transport. On foot you might nip across the road as a car approaches while checking your email on a bike you might slip through a narrow gap, or chance a light on amber in a car you could go too fast, or glance down when a phone message flashes.The one difference comes in terms of physics: it’s only in charge of a motor vehicle when we have a realistic chance of killing or maiming another human. It is not an equal interaction.And this is the key lesson, I’d argue, about the paranoia study: if anything is out to get you, it’s a road system still overly skewed towards the flow of motor traffic, rather than the safety of the most vulnerable road users.

Guardiola arrived at Manchester City in the summer of 2016 and summoned the French defender to his office for a clinical assessment of his future.“Your career is behind you now,” Guardiola told Clichy bluntly. “But you have a duty, every day, every session, every behaviour you have young players are looking up to you and even if you don’t feel like a special player, you’ve done so many years in England, you’ve won trophies, you are somebody and those young players will look up to you and behave like you are behaving.”After one influential season under the Catalan’s guidance Clichy and City parted ways, but his former manager’s words were etched in his memory. Not wanting to slip into mediocrity for the sake of money, Clichy made the bold decision to join the little-known Turkish club Istanbul Basaksehir, who are trying to break the triumvirate of city rivals Galatasaray, Besiktas and Fenerbahce despite taking on their current incarnation only four years ago.When we meet at Basaksehir’s Fatih Terim Stadium, Clichy, now 32, says: “When I came here I thought it would be easier and maybe I could take it a bit easy. I was telling my wife it was my last few years so I want to enjoy it, but I am working even harder than I was at City. Why? Because the president gave me everything and they’re here for me. When you meet people like this you just want to give back, to work as hard as possible. The Turkish league is not as professional as the English league and I will always remember what Guardiola told me, so every day I will train as those guys are looking up to me, whether they want it or not. I have to change the club.“You have to be realistic – I am not the Gaël Clichy of 10 years ago and if I was, I wouldn’t be here, that is just a normal process but I do believe I still have something to give the club and the team. When they signed me, they told me they wanted to win the league – it could be this year, it could be next year, it could be in two years. What we do know is that we have all the weapons to do it we have great facilities, the chairman is giving everything, we have great players and we go step by step, that’s their philosophy.”Despite the club’s newness and it only attracting 5,000 fans on average to home games, they do have plenty of influence and other high-calibre players in Emmanuel Adebayor and Arda Turan. There are big plans to expand the training ground and incorporate their academy right next to the stadium. Three pitches are located next to the stadium and it will be 10 within two years in a plan not dissimilar to Manchester City’s, and it is no surprise the Turkish club are being advised by the Premier League champions. Players of Clichy’s experience have been brought in to improve professionalism.“The Turkish league is not the Premier League but I’ve found a club with similarities to Manchester City it’s a new club with good ambitions with a good setup and when I met the people from the club, the chairman and the vice-president, my mind was already made.”Playing under Arsène Wenger and Guardiola gives Clichy plenty of knowledge to proffer. His eyes were opened to a new style under the Manchester City manager and the defender is enthused by what he can still achieve.“When you’ve been used to playing for Arsenal for eight years, and for City for six, it’s always going to be a shock. When you leave those clubs you can only go down a level. I was lucky for the last 12 months to work with Guardiola and often you think of someone being a genius of football but if someone is close, he is the one. I am not saying he’s the best, as other managers have had success with different methods, but he certainly shows you a different way of feeling and seeing football. It was a major shock.”It looks as if Clichy will fall short of lifting another title this season but he is hoping to be part of a club trying to make a name for themselves. “The training ground is going to get better, we have great players and I cannot thank the chairman and vice-chairman enough for the advice they are giving every day to me and my family. It’s been very challenging and it is still an ongoing process to adapt to life here, as it’s a world apart from what I’ve been used to.”Clichy is still focused on long-term success rather than potential disappointment in this season’s title race. He thinks Arsenal need to do the same as they attempt to replace Wenger. “For 22 years, what this guy has done not just for Arsenal, but for English football, people should remember.“I think they came to a moment where people just want to see someone else. It’s not a matter of if you win the Europa League, the league or this or that, if you bring a new player in, they just want someone new. If even they had won the Europa League they would have asked for someone new because that’s football.”Clichy has played under two of the Premier League’s most influential managers since its inception but he knows in order to change the Super Lig he needs to stick to his simple philosophies. “I only have a few years left, I want to enjoy myself but for me to enjoy myself I need to work. I am a hardworking man and that’s what I’ve trained to do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a7994dec31de0f41b32584b300bbdffb0119a87/0_121_4282_2569/master/4282.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f119c974134d12be88aa2fbadabc6c9c","title":"jose mourinho ajax justin kluivert manchester united anthony martial","story":"José Mourinho is targeting Ajax’s Justin Kluivert this summer, with the 19-year-old favouring a move to Manchester United.Kluivert, son of the former Barcelona and Netherlands centre-forward Patrick, has been in contract discussions with Ajax regarding a new deal.However it is understood that these have broken down because of Kluivert’s demand that he should become the highest-paid player at the club.Kluivert asked for a sizeable rise to €1.5m (£1.3m) a year and a proportion of any future transfer fee, to be split between him and his agent, Mino Raiola. Ajax’s policy is to pay no player more than €1m, so Kluivert demanded a significant signing-on fee to compensate.Kluivert scored 10 goals in 30 league games this season – including a hat-trick in a 5-1 win over Roda in November – and believes he deserves fresh terms to reflect his growing status. He is on the wage of his initial professional contract, signed in 2016, which ends next summer. Kluivert made his international debut in March, as a replacement in the Netherlands’ 3-0 win over Portugal.Kluivert’s likes to play as a wide forward and can operate on either wing, though his preference is on the left. Mourinho was a coach at Barcelona in the late 1990s when Patrick Kluivert played for the club.Mourinho’s interest in Kluivert casts further doubt over the future of Anthony Martial. The 22-year-old also plays on the left but has been unable to hold down a starting berth under the Portuguese. Mourinho criticised him after last Friday’s 1-0 defeat at Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion, and Martial was dropped to bench for Thursday’s goalless draw at West Ham United.Mourinho has said that Romelu Lukaku may be fit enough only for a place on the bench for next Saturday’s FA Cup final against Chelsea.The striker has missed United’s past two matches with an ankle injury and will be absent when they host Watford in their final Premier League match on Sunday. “We hope he can play the final,” Mourinho said. “He is in Belgium having his treatment with communication between the Belgian doctors and our medical department. We are just waiting to see if it is possible for him to be involved in the final. If not starting, at least on the bench.”Mourinho said that Marcus Rashford and Martial would return against Watford. There will also be starts for Sergio Romero, Eric Bailly, Daley Blind and Juan Mata, and Michael Carrick will be captain in his final appearance before joining United’s coaching staff.“He is not going to finish the match because I want him to leave the pitch alone and I want him to feel what the Manchester United supporters feel about him,” Mourinho said of Carrick."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a77a693d720cdf3758c8dae9e25caa77f8740e93/122_81_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6102074af9feaf1e11ffd6e694da435a","title":"wayne rooney everton sam allardyce","story":"Sam Allardyce has denied Wayne Rooney has asked to leave Everton but insisted the former England captain cannot be given assurances over his playing time at Goodison Park.The Everton manager confirmed on Friday that negotiations had taken place over a move to DC United for Rooney, who has another year on his contract plus a 12-month option that can be activated by the club. The 32-year-old is seeking clarification from the Everton hierarchy over the manager’s situation and his future role before deciding his next step, but would prefer to remain at his boyhood club.Allardyce, his own future at Everton shrouded in doubt, said: “My understanding of the situation is there seems to have been some negotiation somewhere along the line but, in terms of clarity as to whether Wayne is leaving or staying, I’ll find out later today when Wayne comes in for training. I don’t get involved in anything regarding transfers in or out or negotiations. All I know is there appears to be an interest from DC United – where that is, where that lies and where Wayne lies with it, I can’t tell you at the moment.“I am always comfortable if any player wants to leave or if any player doesn’t want to leave. But let’s put this right: Wayne Rooney has not asked to leave and neither has Wayne Rooney had any confrontation with me or been in any difficult situation in the time since I’ve been here because we are two adults and we talk.”Allardyce clarified that his stance on players who wish to move did not apply only to Rooney. He added: “Wayne is a special player but if any player wants to leave they can, in my opinion. Whether they can or can’t is another matter. The headline isn’t: ‘Sam says Wayne Rooney can leave if he wants to.’ If any player wants to leave they can go.”Rooney, Everton’s leading goalscorer this season, has become increasingly frustrated with a reduced role under Allardyce. The former England manager, however, insisted no player could be guaranteed minutes on the pitch regardless of who is in charge.Allardyce said: “How as a manager can you guarantee anyone to play? If they don’t play well you can’t select them and if they do play well they stay in the team. That’s the simple fact of the matter. It is up to them to put their game together on a consistent basis.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2456a67925b111a0b93e8ef6f295eea49fbdc31f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a667405f0eb758586623403758f3b6a","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"A wake is in store in Swansea, Klopp faced with a juggling act and a swansong for Conte and Benítez?This feature, you will note, is called ‘10 Things to Look Out For’ rather than ‘10 Things to Look Forward To’. Thank goodness for that, because there might not be much to look forward to at the Liberty Stadium on Sunday. The match between Swansea and Stoke is likely to be a wake, with both clubs wondering how the hell they got into this mess. A number of players will be making their last appearance for both sides, seeing no contradiction in the belief that they are far too good to play in the Championship. Swansea could still stay up, but they need snookers, a miracle and, most unlikely of all, at least one goal. RSSuddenly Southampton seem an attractive proposition again. Having all but avoided relegation, the club can begin looking up rather than down. There would have been an exodus of players had they dropped a ision but Saints, with Mark Hughes likely to remain, will be in a strong position again this summer. Some of the younger players, especially those such as Jack Stephens and Jan Bednarek, ought to come back hardened by the experience. There is no obvious candidate ready to jump ship, as in years gone by, with Ryan Bertrand the biggest-name exit imaginable, while it is difficult to see Sofiane Boufal or Guido Carrillo staying put in Hampshire much longer. It was always going to be a big summer either way, but with survival set to be confirmed at home against Manchester City on Sunday, the club must take stock and learn from their mistakes. BFAt 2pm on Sunday, somebody – maybe, just maybe, on Twitter – is going to be very angry at Jürgen Klopp. He can’t win with his selection for Liverpool’s last league match against Brighton. If he picks his best XI he will be jeopardising their fitness before the Champions League final against Real Madrid if he picks a weakened team he will be jeopardising Liverpool’s place in next season’s Champions League. There are so many things for Klopp to juggle: momentum, mood, match sharpness, avoiding injury to key players. Liverpool only need a point, and Klopp’s history suggests he will start a very strong side with a view to taking players off after an hour. But if one of the Fab Three twangs a hamstring, he may never hear the end of it. RSWith Champions League qualification out of Chelsea’s hands, Sunday’s trip to St James’ Park is ever likelier to be Antonio Conte’s last in charge of the 2017 champions. Of greater impact might be the question of whether it is also a swansong for his counterpart in the home dug-out. Although results have fallen away in recent weeks, Rafa Benítez has much to feel satisfied with a year after guiding Newcastle back up from the Championship: his side have survived comfortably after a rocky start, he has coaxed decisive performances from a number of players such as Jonjo Shelvey, Jamaal Lascelles and Mo Diamé and he remains an enormously popular figure on Tyneside. Yet as ever with Newcastle, off-field uncertainty around budgets and ownership threaten to hobble their progress, and are likely to determine whether Benítez remains at a club for whom a place in at least the top eight should be a realistic goal next season. The chance to sign off 2017-18 with a victory over historic adversaries Chelsea should be one Benítez will jump at. TDOn the face of it, the scene is set for one big royal knees-up in West Yorkshire, with Huddersfield set to toast safety and Arsène Wenger, after 22 years, bowing out of Arsenal. Wenger will be desperate to go out with a bang, particularly after a couple of raw reminders of their shortcomings under him recently, namely their Europa League exit to Atlético Madrid and defeat at Leicester on Wednesday evening. The biggest worry is that Huddersfield might wake up from their survival hangover with a bounce – after celebrating safety into the early hours of Thursday morning at a Fitzrovia nightclub. The best bit about their Premier League party was that, after opting to ditch the plane home – instead favouring the team coach so they could presumably continue festivities more easily – they were told that their coach driver was not permitted to clock up the mileage back from Stamford Bridge. David Wagner subsequently gave his players – who travelled back north on the train – two days off, but can they manage one final lasting surprise before the season’s out? BFThe biggest risk West Bromwich Albion could take this summer is to wriggle out of giving Darren Moore the full-time job. It was cruel, to say the least, that the 44-year-old picked up the manager of the month award on the same day his team were relegated from the Premier League, given he dragged the club up off the floor to the verge of whatwould have ranked one of the most extraordinary miracles of all time. He has galvanised a troubled group that had gone awry under Alan Pardew’s leadership and, if he was installed as caretaker manager sooner, it is not unfathomable to imagine a different outcome this season. The other names linked with the job – Dean Smith, Chris Wilder and even Lee Johnson – have all impressed in the Championship and, surely, Moore should at least be given a chance to do the same after bidding farewell to the Premier League at Crystal Palace. BFFor 12 years, Michael Carrick has been the best supporting actor of Old Trafford. He is the only survivor of the last great United team, which won three consecutive titles and a Champions League between 2006 and 2009. Carrick, who replaced Roy Keane by not replacing him at all, had a major impact with his defensive awareness, calmness and particularly the range and positivity of his passing. He had some lows after that - he was twice left to deal with Xavi and Andres Iniesta on his own in a Champions League final, and his mistakes against Bayern Munich in 2010 and Manchester City in 2011 were savagely punished – but recovered to become a senior player either side of Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement. The coaches who appreciated Carrick, like Ferguson and Martin Jol, really appreciated him. On Sunday, United fans will get to pay tribute before he disappears modestly onto the coaching staff. RSAll right-thinking neutrals should hope this Spurs team have another crack at winning something next season, but there is a nagging sense that Sunday’s game against Leicester might be the end of an era. In a sense, that’s obvious: Spurs will play at the new White Hart Lane next season, and the whiff of a new era will extend way beyond the Michelin-starred cooking that will be a feature of Spurs’ new gastrofooty experience. But the Coquilles St. Jacques Grillées et Minestrone de Palourdes won’t taste half as good if Spurs fans are watching a different team to the one that has charmed everyone in the past three seasons. Toby Alderweireld and Danny Rose look certain to leave for, erm, starters. Though they would be missed, their departure would not be heavy on symbolism. But if any of Mauricio Pochettino, Harry Kane, Christian Eriksen and Dele Alli go, the team could break up at speed. RSA pre-match grumble-off between the respective fans here would be quite the spectacle, with Hammers bemoaning their loss of identity on and off the pitch since the London Stadium move and Everton fans simmering with discontent over their unappealing displays under Sam Allardyce. A common thread between them though might be a measure of respect for David Moyes. For all that the Scot’s reputation has tumbled in the past five years, Everton have struggled to regain the consistency and status they had under Moyes while he has at least provided West Ham with sufficient steel and organisation to survive, though fans remain ambivalent about his style and whether he’s the man for the job long-term. With Moyes confident enough to be challenging West Ham’s owners with statements about his future ambitions for the club, he can strengthen his hand with a convincing win over his former club, who also have some managerial issues to resolve, as Wayne Rooney’s wavering over his commitment to the club demonstrates. TDBurnley’s home games have been a struggle. We mean that, for the most part, in a positive sense, because they are arguably the best pound-for-pound team in the ision. Their matches have been tough and uncompromising. In 18 league games at Turf Moor, Burnley have scored 15 and conceded 15. The end-of-season atmosphere may be conducive to the players of both sides having fun of the less masochistic kind. Burnley will stay seventh whatever happens, though Bournemouth could ensure back-to-back top-ten finishes if results go their way. With both sides overachieving spectacularly, this match should also be a celebration of that pariah species: the English manager.

I think they came to a moment where people just want to see someone else. It’s not a matter of if you win the Europa League, the league or this or that, if you bring a new player in, they just want someone new. If even they had won the Europa League they would have asked for someone new because that’s football.”Poland have named their preliminary World Cup squad! As the source of this tweet indicates, Ipswich’s Bartosz Bialkowski is in the initial 35, as are Swansea’s Lukasz Fabianski, Southampton’s Jan Bednarek, Hull’s Kamil Grosicki, West Brom loanee Grzegorz Krychowiak and many more familiar names besides. How do you rate them?Everton travel to West Ham on Sunday, which doesn’t quite smack of being an especially jolly encounter, does it? Will it be farewell to Rooney? Farewell to Big Sam? Farewell to Moyes? Will anyone present care all that much? Jacob Steinberg’s team news and match preview will whet the appetite, though:No Arsène Wenger press conference today. He did his final one yesterday – *sob* – and a few more quotes from that have come out on the wires. Some of it can be found in David Hytner’s write-up from last night.Talking about his most cherished Arsenal memory, Wenger said:“Maybe my first title here because I came completely unknown and in my first full year I won the championship. But I would say personally from 2006 to 2015 it was certainly the period where I needed to be the strongest and did the best job.“Because to accept to commit to five years when you build the stadium to work with restricted resources and keep the club in a position where we can pay our debts back, I personally feel I did my best job in that period. Not the most glamorous maybe, but the most difficult.” Here’s that full Andy Hunter take from Sam Allardyce – who will not guarantee Wayne Rooney game time should he (they) stay at Everton:Middlesbrough play Aston Villa in the Championship play-offs tomorrow. But do you remember when they tonked Manchester City 8-1 – with Afonso Alves, Jeremie Aliadiere and Fabio Rochemback running amok? I’ve not been on the cheese: it actually happened, and it happened 10 years ago today:I guess the biggest point of interest will be the fitness concerns around Gylfi Sigurdsson and Aron Gunnarsson, although I fully expect both to make Heimir Hallgrimsson’s selection. Can Iceland do it all again? They kind of have, already, by qualifying at all.It’s not only farewell to Arsène Wenger at Huddersfield on Sunday. It’s farewell, too, to Terriers midfielder Dean Whitehead. He will retire at the grand old age of 36 and join David Wagner’s coaching staff – eventually taking over their Under-17 side from next January.Whitehead has only featured six times this season but I’ll remember him as having had an excellent career – I make it 619 senior appearances, and he was a particularly effective box-to-box midfielder at Stoke and Sunderland. I also remember watching him absolutely crack a 30-yarder into the top corner for Oxford United at some point in the early 2000s, maybe against Rochdale?“Dean is a winner. He demands 100 per cent effort from himself and everyone around him, he commands respect and is top quality in everything he does,” Wagner says.Yes, the problem Mike outlined is from one perspective a first-world one. But at the same time it does impact downwards on everything else.If you sign up for The Recap – which showcases the very best of our sport coverage – then the latest one will be  in ... oooh ... about 28 minutes.Hey, it was a genuine question about YouTube thumb ratios.A thought for the day from reader Mike Brooks:“As a Palace fan I have emotionally reconciled myself with the prospect of relegation several times this season. Almost half the league will have had a similar experience this year so I feel the time is ripe for the following allegory. Bare with me. The paralysing fear of ‘the drop’ has come to shape the way 10 or more Premier League clubs approach their 38 games in the sun (under a blue, blue Sky). Meanwhile, the Top 6 has become a ‘mini league’ which apparently captivates the world.“Surely, then, the top flight has become a microcosm of the capitalist system whereby the exploited proletariat are so preoccupied with outdoing those around them, so dazzled by the impossible dream of ascending the class hierarchy (Leicester’s title-win was probably staged to prop this system up for another generation), that they fail to prevent systematic inequality from growing exponentially and indefinitely.“After all, what can Palace hope for having stayed up? Most likely our path is that of Swansea and Stoke. A few unremarkable seasons, a bonk of the head on the glass ceiling, and a passive sinking back to the Championship. So rise in solidarity, relegation candidates! Divest from the relegation drama, staged by the elite to preoccupy us! West Brom, Stoke and Swansea did not die, and Palace did not survive, for we are all second-tier now. “The middle paragraph says it pretty well, actually. Wouldn’t the world be simpler if we were completely done with this idea of “growth” to some utterly nebulous end?Meanwhile, the FA has just confirmed that Gareth Southgate will go all out and name his final 23 players for Russia 2018 on 16 May – which is next Wednesday if you aren’t too hot with numbers.As trailed earlier, Russia have named their preliminary World Cup squad.One surprise is that Denis Glushakov, the experienced and often influential Spartak midfielder, only makes the reserve list. Fyodor Chalov, who scored for CSKA Moscow against Arsenal a month ago, gets a chance to impress up top. It looks as if key defenders Georgi Dzhikiya and Viktor Vasin haven’t made it back from injury in time, which is a huge blow. Do you give the host nation much hope?That last entry brings me to ask: any Boreham Wood fans in the house? I’d like to know exactly how you’ve done it this season. And so would everyone else. Do write in!There’s a huge game at Wembley tomorrow. Tranmere, thwarted by Forest Green last year, are a match away from returning to the Football League – and in their way stand, quite improbably, Boreham Wood. It’s one of the smallest clubs in the National League against probably the biggest. There’s a nice story in Jewish News about how the local synagogue in Borehamwood* plans to mark promotion.*Not a typo, it’s a longstanding anomaly that the club is Boreham Wood and the place is Borehamwood. I’ve no doubt there’ll be someone tuning in who can explain it ...I will be saying “press conference” and not “presser” throughout today’s proceedings, incidentally, because the latter is an abomination.Newcastle, of course, host Chelsea on Sunday in a game that has Top Four Significance for the visitors. Chelsea must win and hope Liverpool lose at home to Brighton. I’m not sure the latter, in particular, is much of a goer. We have Louise Taylor reporting from Rafa Benitez’s press conference today, while Dominic Fifield will be at the media’s standard 1.15pm date with Antonio Conte.Yes, it’s an interesting one isn’t it? I love Mitrovic and it is worth remembering, through all the pros and cons, that he is still just 23 and has had a fairly remarkable career so far, goalscoring-wise. At Fulham he’s been helped by operating in an insanely creative side and perhaps he’s responded well so a compatriot, Jokanovic, being able to put an arm round him. He seems the type who needs that. I think he has a decent top-flight future, whoever that’s with ...It being Friday, and this blog being exceptionally Friday-ish, I find myself reminded of this charming little ditty about Friday from a few years back. Three million thumbs-downs vs 800,000 thumbs-ups! Is that a YouTube record?Seems an opportune moment to step away from the computer and grab a coffee.“With this weekend being the last of round of fixtures and narratives all over the place, I feel like its episode 38 of a long season,” emails Paul Fitzgerald. “Some characters I thought were killed off found themselves back, battling a race against time or The Championship. Some storylines never really developed (Watford), and the villain of the piece wasn’t actually defeated because, well he finished second. Don’t know if the spin off in the summer will be any better.”It’s an odd situation for everyone involved, really, because Rooney needs to play a bit of a guessing game about his own future at Goodison – if one assumes Allardyce’s own situation remains as clear as mud. Hard to tell who’s pulling the strings there but you wouldn’t expect Rooney to clear off without good reason having made such an emotional return last year.We’ll get Andy Hunter’s take to you as soon as we can but here, courtesy of PA, is Sam Allardyce’s view on the future of Wayne Rooney, as articulated just now. Not sure how much this really moves things along but there is clearly something in the MLS chatter:“My understanding is there seems to have been some negotiation along the line but as for clarity as to whether Wayne is staying or going we’ll see later on,” Allardyce said.“I don’t get involved in transfers but there seems to be an interest from DC United. Only when I speak to him today I’ll find out where the situation lies. I’m comfortable with any player who wants to leave but let’s get this clear, Wayne Rooney hasn’t asked to leave.”Can\u0027t cope – one day to go til Cov vs Notts. Considering how yo-yo we\u0027ve been it\u0027s incredible we\u0027ve waited 22 years for another play off bash (not easy watching, especially seeing club legend Mark Stallard in other colours): they used to go well under Warnock, but I can\u0027t see us doing it this time having been well off the boil since Christmas. But, Coventry seem to have goals in them at either end, so could be a pair of thrillers for the neutrals – sorry Exeter and Lincoln but shame it\u0027s not at Wembley (no offense to you, just wish this was out the way!)Yes, this League Two play-off is going to be huge. These two were actually playing top-flight football against one another in 1991-92 – now they battle for a place in the third tier and it could be the start of a long way back ...Potential bad news for Manchester United?Jose Mourinho has said that Romelu Lukaku might only be fit enough for a place on the bench when Manchester United face Chelsea in the FA Cup final next Saturday.Lukaku has missed United’s last two matches after suffering an ankle injury against Arsenal last month and he will be absent again when they host Watford in their final Premier League match tomorrow. The striker is recovering in Belgium and Mourinho will be desperate to have him available against Chelsea after seeing his team follow last week’s 1-0 defeat to Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion with an unimpressive 0-0 draw with West Ham on Thursday night.“We hope he can play the final,” Mourinho said. “He is in Belgium having his treatment with communication between the Belgian doctors and our medical department. We are just waiting to see if it is possible for him to be involved in the final. If not starting, at least on the bench.”A very sad anniversary today, and one that it’s important we all take time to remember.And we are, lest any of us forget, in large part here to look ahead toOne big early bit of transfer news – or potential transfer news – to bring you. Jamie Jackson has word that Manchester United would like to sign Ajax’s bright young buck Justin Kluivert, who is of course the son of Patrick. Kluivert’s agent, you will read here, is one Mino Raiola – so I’ve no doubt this one will go off without a single glitch ...Lots of managers due to hold court in the next few hours. Sam Allardyce takes to the pulpit up at Finch Farm around about now, I believe – we have Andy Hunter up there, and there will doubtless be plenty of questions asked about Wayne Rooney’s future. And probably Big Sam’s own, too.It’s Friday – but not just any Friday. It’s the final Friday of the Premier League season and if you thought we’d be on the beach without a care in the world then ... well ... give it a few days. Up and down the country there are managers giving pre-match press conferences for the final time this season, making wry comments about not-having-to-see-you-lot-again-for-a-while and perhaps – given the lack of obvious dramatic tension around most of Sunday’s games – kicking back and offering us a few more reflective bits, too.And there’s much more going on. The play-offs are in full swing – did you see Jon Nolan’s brilliant winner for Shrewsbury at Charlton last night? – so there’s plenty to look ahead to on that front. Derby and Fulham face off tonight in the Championship. I think a couple of preliminary World Cup squads are being announced today too – Russia’s is due and Iceland, I’m told, will name their final 23. Stay tuned for those!We’ve got a few hours for all this so let’s also, you know, chat. What have you liked the most about this season? What haven’t you enjoyed?

But what next? Does it turn them into a burger? Add them to a salad? Or is the classic wrap the only acceptable form of falafel?In 2004, writing about his attempt to sell falafel to drunken ravers in east London, Hoxton Beach founder Patrick Matthews felt he had to explain these exotic “balls made of chickpeas or other pulses”. Fourteen years later, the subject of this month’s How to Eat is no longer a tahini riddle wrapped in a pitta enigma. Falafel is everywhere, from specialist slingers such as London’s Mr Falafel or Manchester’s Go Falafel to the supermarket aisles. These days, falafel is as British as bao, poutine and poké.Yet, frequently, something is lost in the translation of falafel from Arabic or Hebrew. Consequently, How to Eat – the blog series exploring how to best to enjoy Britain’s favourite foods – feels compelled to step in and raise objection to such things as the baked falafel taco. Not in an attempt to assert an indisputably authentic Levantine way to eat falafel (in the region itself the origin, ingredients, method of prep and best way to serve falafel are all keenly disputed), but to pose some basic and urgent questions, such as why would anyone put falafel on a pizza?Be it making “falafel” from sweet potato, pumpkin and beetroot, or serving them on toast with avocado, as a “fawaffle” or in lettuce leaves as a low-carb canape, there is a lot going on in the WTF!?-world of fusion-falafel, which can be dismissed without discussion. To debate it would only legitimise those street food traders and recipe writers who, clearly, in their endless quest for novelty, have forgotten how to step back and ask, seriously, how is this adding to the sum of gastronomic happiness?Other bastardisations, however, namely the falafel burger and the falafel salad, are ingrained in UK culture. However, immovable as they may be, it is always valuable to point out how terrible they are. Steroid-pumping the falafel up to burger proportions, then encasing it in a thick burger bun, is lunacy. The result is a sandwich that, at best, if it has been generously topped with sauces, quickly becomes a sloppy mush and, if it arrives drier, is like chewing your way through a carpet sample.That is why falafel served as a more traditional plated meal or mezze works. Falafel served with pitta, garlicky hummus, sesame-rich, lemony tahini sauce (or a little loosened labneh), with vivid pink pickled turnips, tomatoes, cucumber and shredded red cabbage, brings together a collection of contrasting and complementary flavours, which collectively form a cohesive meal. That plate has everything: layers of sharpness and savoury depth, a dirty fried edge, carbohydrate heft, freshness. Still, mezze lacks one thing: functionality. That is why the falafel wrap is falafel’s pinnacle. All those mezze items are great, but they are even better when intermingled in a wrap around some lightly squashed falafel (important to ensure even distribution), so that you get, if not a little bit of everything in each bite, then in every other bite. Plus, it is all there in a handily portable format. Note: the tendency in cafes and bars to serve a falafel mezze on – but not in – a wrap is bizarre. It looks pretty on the plate, but if the idea is that the diner should then create their own wrap, that demands an untenable level of DIY. Conversely, if you are meant to enjoy the flatbread with the plates components, it should be served on the side not underneath them.Serving falafel in a split pitta is fine but, in the UK, commercial pittas often lack durability, staying power and structural integrity. They begin to fall apart after a few bites. Size is an issue, too. If your pitta is too tightly stuffed, tomato and cucumber invariably spill out at each mouthful.A far better alternative is to use a thicker, chewier Middle Eastern-style flatbread (there are endless variations, but something on the khubzlafa axes), and wrap your falafel like a burrito, to create a reasonably sturdy baton. Do not attempt to cut corners by using tortilla, roti or other thinner unleavened flatbreads. They really don’t work. The falafel wrap needs a certain density and chew at its edges.Hot or at least still warm from the fryer, falafel can be sensational: crisp, moist, fluffy and nubbly within, verdant with herbs and heady with spices. As they cool, however, that magic floats away on the vents of hot air. Served deliberately cold, perhaps from a supermarket supermarket chiller cabinet, falafel become gritty truffles of tedium, as tasteless as packing foam. As the food writer Daniel Young once put it: “It must be eaten hot and fresh. You can wait for your falafel, but your falafel shouldn’t wait for you.”There is a school of thought that putting hummus on a falafel wrap is akin to putting roast potatoes on a chip butty – it’s too much of the same thing. That is plainly wrong. The closer analogy would be dressing a salad that contains olives with olive oil. Hummus acts as a lubricant in the wrap and it should have a significantly different flavour profile to the falafel.There is, elsewhere, a lot of talk about adding heat – harissa, spicy chipotle mayo, pickled chillies, hot sauce – to the falafel wrap, but those are blunt instruments that could easily upset what is a relatively delicate ecology of flavours. Pickled vegetables are as sharp-elbowed as you want the flavours to get on this sandwich. If you must have some heat, use Yemeni zhoug. Its light, precise, herb-modulated heat will step more lightly in your wrap.Good additions: Hummus tahini sauce zhoug tzatziki or a similar cucumberyoghurt sauce (use dill not mint) potato tots (used sparingly, they mine your wrap with joy) smoky grilled aubergine or even a little slick of baba ganoush shredded red cabbage, fresh parsley, chopped little gem for added crunch diced tomatoes and cucumber crisp pickled vegetables, usually fermented turnips whose fizzing, vivacious sourness should refresh your palate at regular intervals. Bad additions: halloumi (too dry, too rubbery) avocado (both in its flavour and texture, nonsensical here) dill pickles (dull pickles, whose overt vinegary twang is too bullying in this wrap) chillies, harissa, hot sauce mayonnaise (a claggy interloper) pickled cauliflower (too tough, everything in there needs to yield easily, even if it has a crisp edge) any sweet honeypomegranate sauces (this is a savoury dish) chickpea or tabbouleh salads, an OTT addition raw carrot spinach leaves, which are commonly used to pad out wraps to no discernible positive effect.The falafel wrap is fast food – a quick turnaround, on-the-move meal that never tastes quite as good when sitting down, particularly at home. Certainly in the UK, it is a lunch item or an evening meal, one that works best as a ballast before a big night, rather than after a bellyful of beer, when its comparatively subtle flavours cannot always cut through the alcohol fug. You need to eat it quickly while it is still warm, preferably while walking to aid digestion. If your falafel wrap is a good one, you will spend most of the journey dodging the drip-dripping of sauces from its paperfoil-wrapped bottom, so you must maintain a stance (a concave, stooped stance, sandwich held just in front of your face) that How to Eat likes to call “shirt alert”. Grab more napkins than you are offered, you will need them.Not essential while moving and eating. You need both hands to disrobe your wrap and keep it from flip-flopping around. However, this can be quite a greasy meal, so afterwards something fizzy andor dry, with a nice carbonic acid edge, is welcome: diet cola, pale ale (craft keg not cask), cava etc.So, falafel – how do you eat yours?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8d1e76ed69d5053f9ba9a678bbaed893572da38/0_0_8533_5120/master/8533.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39f1d7bea0bf26fb3b30ea6f3ef3914c","title":"since reuniting with my fiance i have become his secret life","story":"After five months apart, we got back together but a recent conversation with his mum revealed he had not told his family.

It is still happening. I bought a £2,367.82 return flight with Delta and my credit card has been charged for the outward and inward-bound tickets inidually. The full sum for both has also been put on hold, meaning I’ve effectively paid twice. Delta advises that it is my bank, Santander, which is at fault. Santander claims to have never heard of this problem and says the ringfenced sum should be unfrozen within five days. This means I’m in danger of exceeding my credit card limit until the second sum is released. GT, Hindhead, SurreyOnline forums report similar experiences from travellers who have purchased airline tickets.When you use a debit or credit card, the merchant pre-authorises the sum with your bank to ensure that you have enough funds to settle the debt.This is then reserved by the bank until the transaction is completed or cancelled, or until the pre-authorisation period expires, usually after three to seven days.Although the pre-authorised sum is removed from the available balance, it is not actually debited.According to Santander, Delta pre-authorised the total £2,367.82 cost of the return flight, but when it came to requesting the money, the airline split the cost into two payments of £1,183.91.“As a result, the requested sums did not match the pre-authorised amount and both transactions were debited from the balance, although the £2,367.82 was not actually paid out,” says Santander.“On review, whilst Santander is not at fault, we have offered the customer £50 as a gesture of goodwill for any confusion and inconvenience this may have caused.”Delta explains that it splits return airfares in two to benefit from a lower credit card fee rate and insists the fault lies with banks who should release the hold on reserved funds once the payment has gone through.The same thing happened in the case I featured last May.Although the pre-authorised sum will be reapplied to a customer’s balance in due course, it’s extraordinary that banks and airlines have not worked out a way to avoid this apparent bill shock instead of passing the buck to each other.If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

By  Moira DoneganWhen the #MeToo moment began in earnest last October, many women felt optimistic, galvanised others felt uncomfortable. As stories of abuse and harassment accumulated in the media, men began to experience consequences for their treatment of women. Some lost jobs, others were demoted, many faced public embarrassment. The careers of men such as Hollywood producer and alleged rapist Harvey Weinstein, masturbating comedian Louis CK, and predatory actor Kevin Spacey were declared dead. Others, like the groping chef Mario Batali, took a temporary “step back” from their public lives. A reckoning seemed to be underway, and many women felt that it was long overdue.In the media and in private life, conversations about consent, hostile environments and power began, and there was a growing acknowledgment that a man’s unwanted sexual overtures were a symptom of broader social and political forces. Soon, these discussions were interrupted by hand-wringing and anger from male commentators – everyone from conservative columnist Andrew Sullivan to Donald Trump – who claimed the movement had gone too far before it really began. But unexpected ides emerged between feminists as well.Some feminists urged caution others wanted the reckoning to go further. But the most common complaint about #MeToo came from those who felt that the whole movement had very quickly become silly. Self-described feminists such as Daphne Merkin and Bari Weiss in the New York Times, Katie Roiphe in Harper’s, Germaine Greer in the Sydney Morning Herald and 100 French women in Le Monde complained that many of the incidents of harassment were too minor to warrant opprobrium. They argued that by grouping together such a wide spectrum of sexual misbehaviour, #MeToo had lost a sense of nuance. They called on women to toughen up. Whatever happened to no-nonsense rejections, they asked. Those who complained about harassment and assault, Merkin wrote, “perceive themselves to be as frail as Victorian housewives”. By this logic, women could solve the problem of sexual harassment and assault with good humour, patience and a high tolerance for pain.This disagreement was quickly characterised in the media as generational. Older feminists, we were told – say, anyone over 40 – were sinisterly complicit, laughably outdated, or just too scared of overstepping. Younger women, depending on who you asked, were either righteously passionate, naively idealistic, or out for blood.In part, this notion of a generational ide came from the feminist opponents and supporters of #MeToo themselves. In Harper’s, Roiphe derided the #MeToo movement as “Twitter feminism”, giving the impression that only narcissistic, social media-obsessed millennials want a reckoning over sexual assault. In her article criticising the direction #MeToo was taking, Bari Weiss emphasised the youth and naivety of an anonymous woman who made allegations against the comedian Aziz Ansari. Meanwhile, the feminist website Jezebel, whose readers and writers skew young, ran an article headlined “The Backlash to #MeToo is Second-Wave Feminism”, gesturing vaguely at a misguided crop of older feminist thinkers but not engaging much with those thinkers’ actual achievements and failures. Each side used age stereotypes, with varying degrees of cynicism – older women were crotchety or out of touch, younger women were egoists or spoiled children. None of this commentary seemed interested in the fact that the women coming forward with stories of sexual abuse were both young and old. #MeToo’s feminist detractors also come from different generations. At only 32, Weiss is young enough to be Merkin’s daughter, or Greer’s granddaughter.The #MeToo moment and its backlash made it clear that there really was a ide among feminists, but analysis of that ide cast it as a mere catfight, or a screaming match between weary mothers and teenage daughters. The implication was that the feminist debate unfolding around #MeToo is a kind of routine domestic drama, something we’ve seen before.This is a mistake. A closer look at the arguments being made by these two camps reveals a deeper, more serious intellectual rift. What’s really at play is that feminism has come to contain two distinct understandings of sexism, and two wildly different, often incompatible ideas of how that problem should be solved. One approach is inidualist, hard-headed, grounded in ideals of pragmatism, realism and self-sufficiency. The other is expansive, communal, idealistic and premised on the ideals of mutual interest and solidarity. The clash between these two kinds of feminism has been starkly exposed by #MeToo, but the crisis is the result of shifts in feminist thought that have been decades in the making.The central claim of the anti-#MeToo feminists is that the movement does not treat inidual women as moral agents with the capacity to say no, to enjoy and pursue sex, and to do wrong. From this perspective, women who come forward about their experiences of harassment or assault should often be given more responsibility for those experiences than the rhetoric of #MeToo assigns them. This thinking partakes in a long moral tradition – one that’s highly compatible with capitalism – in which personal responsibility, independence, and willingness to withstand hardship are revered as particularly valuable virtues. It’s an ethos of pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps – from poverty into prosperity, or, in the anti-#MeToo feminists’ logic, from “feminine” victimhood into “masculine” strength. They believe that the pervasiveness of sexual harassment suggests that it is inevitable, and that the best response is not anger, but resolve. Theirs is a feminism that posits that inidual women have the power to make choices to diminish the negative impact of sexism, and to endure any sexist unpleasantness that can’t be avoided – if only they have the grit to handle it.On the other hand, there is the #MeToo movement. It might seem strange to assert that #MeToo can be spoken of as a single ideology at all – that this cultural moment, which has exposed such a broad array of bad behaviour across so many industries and disciplines, could ever be coherent enough to have an agenda. But #MeToo, as a social movement and as a personal gesture, makes certain assumptions that aren’t compatible with the intellectual habits of most mainstream feminisms that have preceded it. By saying “me too”, an inidual woman makes herself a part of a broader group, and chooses to stand with others who have been harassed, assaulted or raped. This solidarity is powerful. It is still rare to see such a large group of women identifying their suffering as women’s suffering, claiming that they have all been harmed by the same forces of sexism, and together demanding that those forces be defeated.In this light, the ersity and breadth of the #MeToo movement is not a weakness, but a strength. After all, if so many women, with so many different kinds of lives, have experienced the same sexist behaviour from men, then it becomes easier to believe that the problem goes beyond iniduals and instead relates to wider cultural forces. The ubiquity of sexual harassment means that an inidual can’t simply avoid it by making the right choices, or by steeling herself with forceful determination the demand that she do so begins to look absurd.Call it, then, a conflict between “inidualist” and “social” feminisms. In part, the rift is between visions of how to undertake the feminist project, of which tactics are best: whether through inidual empowerment, or through collective liberation. But there is a greater moral ide between these two strands of thought, because #MeToo and its critics also disagree over where to locate responsibility for sexual abuse: whether it is a woman’s responsibility to navigate, withstand and overcome the misogyny that she encounters, or whether it is the shared responsibility of all of us to eliminate sexism, so that she never encounters it in the first place.This tension, between inidualist and social feminisms, has dogged the women’s movement since its revival in the mid-20th century. According to the inidualist model of feminism, personal responsibility, inidual freedoms and psychological adjustments offer a woman meaningful routes out of the suffering imposed by patriarchy, and into equality with men. Many of the most famous western feminists have been working in this tradition. For instance, Betty Friedan, author of the hugely influential 1960s feminist text The Feminine Mystique, argued that sexist cultural codes prevent women from achieving personal happiness. Friedan, a psychologist by training, focused on the inner lives of white, American, middle-class women at midcentury. More recently, inidualist feminism found a high-profile advocate when Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, published her memoir-cum-manifesto Lean In in 2013. Sandberg laments the lack of women in leadership positions, and her book is a how-to manual for women with lofty corporate ambitions.Social feminism has a similarly long, if less well-known, history. Soon after Friedan’s book became a bestseller, Italian feminists such as Leopoldina Fortunati and Silvia Federici began to formulate a different way of looking at the problems that women faced. As Marxists, they sought to analyse how men as a class related to women as a class. They were less interested in ideas of empowerment and self-actualisation than they were in isions of labour, living conditions and cold, hard cash. They argued that so-called “women’s work” – everything from mopping floors to dressing wounds to breastfeeding, cooking, prostitution, laundry and tending to the elderly – should not only be seen as work, but as essential to the capitalist wage-labour system. If men did not have these functions performed for them at home, these women argued, they would not be able to return to work and produce effectively. Male work in the factory relied upon female work in the home.When Federici’s Wages for Housework campaign launched in 1972, it attracted fierce public debate – first in Italy, and then in the US after Federici moved to New York and opened a Wages for Housework office in Brooklyn. The political mainstream found Federici’s idea ridiculous. Could she really mean that a woman should be paid for scrubbing the floors in her husband’s house? But the movement relied on the understanding that a wage was necessary for work to be seen as work, and for the people who did it to be seen as worthy of dignity and protection. More a rhetorical device than an immediate policy prescription, the demand “wages for housework” relied on a conception of women as a “class” in the same sense as a class of workers – a group of people with something in common who could organise on behalf of their shared interests.The Wages for Housework movement fizzled out, but its influence has lived on in campaigns for racial justice, gay rights, housing rights and sex workers’ rights. Behind Wages for Housework lay the idea that women’s oppression was widespread, that it had common features even for women who lived very different lives, and that it was more than just a personal experience – it was a political phenomenon. But because sexism beats so many people down, that also meant that there was a community of women who could pull each other up. Those who experience gendered oppression can band together to end it.Something similar is at stake in #MeToo’s assertions that sexual harassment and assault are systemic, and that women can unite to demand an end to them. While inidualist feminists such as Friedan and Sandberg have examined the problem of sexism by zooming in, to consider women’s psyches and attitudes, Wages for Housework zoomed out, to examine how women were oppressed by the economic forces of capitalism. #MeToo has a less ideological, more ad hoc approach to its analysis of patriarchy. But its gesture proceeds from the assumption that misogyny is structural, and that women have a shared interest in fighting it.This does not mean that #MeToo treats all women’s experiences as the same. The movement has included stories from women of different races, orientations and religions. It has brought testimony from women who are rich and poor, healthy and chronically ill, cis and trans, famous and anonymous. This variety has led to an increasing acknowledgment that misogyny takes different forms, and that not all women have access to the same tools used to mitigate it.At its best, #MeToo’s social feminism has been heavily influenced by black American feminist scholars such as Kimberlé Crenshaw, whose work aims to confront the combined nature of racism and sexism in the lives of black women, and to analyse how, for the people who experience both racism and sexism, the phenomena don’t feel distinct at all. In her 1989 legal article Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex, Crenshaw called for a new way of understanding oppression that she referred to as “intersectionality”. Put very simply, this meant taking into account the ways that oppression looks different for different people, and how iniduals experience oppression along more than one axis at once. In practice, Crenshaw’s approach suggests that an effective movement against patriarchal oppression must also confront other systemic inequalities – ones that lend power and viciousness to many women’s experiences of sexism.Intersectionality has given #MeToo a more expansive understanding of sexual harassment and assault. The gesture of saying “me too” implies solidarity with all women who have had these experiences, but the form the movement has taken has also allowed for it to be a specific, personal declaration, and for those testimonies to come from women with different stories and in different circumstances. For every anti-#MeToo feminist who scornfully asks, “Why didn’t you just leave?”, there have been dozens of women explaining the circumstances of their lives that effectively barred the door. Often, these stories have made it heartbreakingly clear that not everyone can risk their job by giving a firm, uncompromising “no” to a handsy boss or coworker that not everyone can afford to call an emergency cab that not everyone has the privileges that make it easy to act in the ways that the inidualist feminists so often prescribe.#MeToo’s sheer number of testimonies has vindicated theories of sexism as a universal, but not uniform, force –that is, as something that every woman will experience, but that every woman will experience in different ways. But in its solidarity, its public gesture of women coming together to demand an end to harassment and assault, the movement also continues the tradition of women’s class consciousness, unity and need for confrontation with systemic injustice. Call it the “too” of #MeToo: the understanding that meaningful liberation from misogyny will only be achieved collectively, with changes at the structural, cultural and institutional levels. Social feminism does not aspire to enable a few women to gain positions of power in patriarchal systems. It’s not about giving women “a seat at the table”. It’s about taking the table apart, so that we can build a new one together.This is not a simple proposition. As an approach, social feminism has real flaws, though its most significant weaknesses are not the ones that #MeToo’s prominent critics choose to address. The real weakness of social feminism is not that it encourages women to be oversensitive about discomforts, but that it is so broad. The call for women to unite can overlook the kinds of pain and conflict that can exist between them.After all, who do we mean when we talk about “women”? What experiences or conditions, exactly, do we identify as common to all women? It is difficult to generalise about so many people at once, and questions of injustice, inequality and privilege mean that doing so puts us at the risk of ignoring vital differences. Women are a varied bunch, and they encounter intersecting oppressions that are not of patriarchy’s exclusive making: racism, classism, ability and sexuality. Often, these oppressions are enforced by other women. There are vast gulfs that separate women from one another: gulfs of racism and money, of colonialism, bigotry, history, resentment, defensiveness, ignorance and hurt. It can be very hard to see each other across them.#MeToo, however, has made it clear that solidarity among women is possible. The working definition of “women”, as #MeToo has constructed it, can be understood simply: as everyone who has experienced misogyny. It’s a bleak kind of solidarity, this acknowledgment of shared suffering. But #MeToo has transformed that mournful acknowledgment into something much more hopeful. If the #MeToo movement has prompted many women to focus on misogynist behaviour with a unifying grief and anger, it has also led many of them to contemplate our shared power and common vision for a different world. When the social feminists of #MeToo call for changes that would make harassment, assault and other forms of misogyny rare, their very act of collective imagining makes such a world more possible: the more we stand together in this demand, the easier it becomes to imagine a world where respect is common, where cruelty is rare, where all of us think with more empathy and intelligence about the lives of others, and where being women will not doom us to suffering or limitation.Again, this is an old debate: whether feminism’s aim should be to transform society, or to better equip inidual women to navigate within it. But why, then, has this clash been framed as generational, when it is clear that the two visions of feminism have been doing battle for decades? Part of it, of course, is ageism and incuriosity – the reflexive tendency to presume that the old are too timid and the young are too reckless. And there is the idea, unique to feminism among all other strands of political thought, that feminism is a social movement that must occur in discrete, coherent and temporal “waves”.But another reason why #MeToo has been framed as a generational conflict is because the inidualist feminists of the anti-#MeToo backlash have framed their own resistance to the movement as grounded in wisdom, realism and, above all, maturity. To them, all this talk of a reimagined, recreated new world sounds hopelessly naive. Daphne Merkin summed up the tenor of the anti-#MeToo assessment in her article in the New York Times, when she wrote to the women coming forward: “Grow up, this is real life”.This is a common, but still very strange belief: that the epitome of maturity and personal strength is the resigned acceptance that the world cannot be better than it is, that we cannot be kinder to one another, that male entitlement, crassness and predation are permanent and unchangeable and must be endured. It is a bizarre conception of strength, one that dismisses as childish weakness any demand for a better world, any hope that things might one day be different. There is a way of thinking that makes this approach by the anti-#MeToo feminists seem strong and pragmatic. But there is another way of thinking that makes it seem very sad.In her book Trauma and Recovery, about the treatment of rape victims and other psychiatric patients who have undergone horrible abuse, the Harvard psychiatrist Judith Herman writes of the temptation to sympathise with a patient’s abuser. “It is very tempting to take the side of the perpetrator,” she writes. “All the perpetrator asks is that the bystander do nothing. He appeals to the universal desire to see, hear, and speak no evil. The victim, on the contrary, asks the bystander to share the burden of pain.” Something similar may be at work in the anti-#MeToo feminists’ desire to advocate for an inidualist feminism. Their call to sympathise more with the perpetrators of sexual assault, and to place greater responsibility for those assaults on the choices of women who experience them, is part of an effort not to feel implicated in the suffering of others, not to share that burden of pain. #MeToo and the reckoning that it has provoked has given us all knowledge we would rather not have – knowledge of just how normal some terrible things are, of just how much some of us have suffered. The anti-#MeToo feminists of the world are not the only ones who feel tempted to look away.

In fact, on average grammar schools get less money per child than other schools do.”Pressed on how many grammar school places the fund would create, Hinds said: “It will be somewhere around the 3-4,000 mark in terms of number of places, but it will depend on exactly where.”He said the bidding criteria for the fund meant the money would help poorer children. “To be able to expand as a selective school you need to come forward with a proposal of how you are going to reach out further with inidual primary schools, look again at your admissions to make sure you are as inclusive as possible, because we want more children from disadvantaged backgrounds to be able to access that education.”Labour and teaching unions said the plan would ert money from already hard-pressed school budgets. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said: “The continued obsession with grammar schools will do nothing for the vast majority of children. It is absurd for ministers to push ahead with plans to expand them when the evidence is clear they do nothing to improve social mobility.”Kevin Courtney, a joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “This is money that would be better invested in ensuring all schools could provide for the basic needs of their pupils without having to ask for money from parents.”Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Hinds denied the government was favouring grammar schools. He said: “There have been about 800,000 new school place created since 2010, and part of that has come from free school, part of it has come from schools expanding. We continue to have capital funding available to all types of school to expand. “Grammar schools haven’t been able to expand in that same sort of way … We just want more good school places, more choice for parents, reflecting the existing ersity in the system.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5e480234b9acaf60c040c8f1cfa4d02f67fa83d/0_196_2304_1382/master/2304.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2111868e7238e34f954c396cffa20bb2","title":"theresa may sets up cabinet teams to thrash out customs plan","story":"Brexiters tasked with working on customs partnership, with ‘max-fac’ option studied by remainersTheresa May has ided her cabinet into two groups to fight out their differences over Britain’s post-Brexit customs arrangements, intensifying speculation that she is preparing to delay her decision on the issue.No 10 sources confirmed that the prime minister had formed the working groups, which would report back on her preferred customs partnership model and the maximum-facilitation option at next Tuesday’s meeting of her inner Brexit cabinet.Her senior ministers are split over how Britain should manage its customs arrangements with the European Union after it leaves the bloc, with the issue threatening to ide the cabinet and the Tory party itself.One group will focus on the customs partnership plan, under which the UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU – until now Downing Street’s favourite option, but dismissed this week by the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, as “crazy” and unworkable. The group will include Brexiters Liam Fox and Michael Gove, along with leading remainer David Lidington, the minister for the Cabinet Office.The Brexiters’ preferred “max-fac” proposal, which relies on technology to minimise border checks, will be studied by remainers Greg Clark, the business secretary, and Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, along with the Brexit secretary, David Davis, a key leave supporter.Downing Street insiders suggested that each group of ministers had been picked for their relevant departmental responsibilities, rather than to give each proposal a “going over” by opponents. Neither Johnson nor the chancellor, Philip Hammond, were included in the working groups, with cabinet sources suggesting that they were considered to be the “ultras” on each side, meaning their involvement could have made discussions difficult. The ministers only have until Tuesday to examine their options, with civil servants’ support, leaving them little time to focus on detail. This has increased the likelihood that each team will conclude both options need yet more work. Whitehall officials believe they can persuade Brussels that a redrafted version of May’s preferred plan is workable, despite EU negotiators previously describing it as “magical thinking”.Cabinet sources claimed that few ministers were likely to shift from their established positions on post-Brexit customs arrangements. Fox is understood to be immovable over his opposition to the customs partnership, while friends of Davis have suggested he could quit over the issue. However, one senior Whitehall insider suggested the move could give the prime minister a “dignified way out” from her customs partnership plan, which has infuriated hard Brexiters who see it as a way of keeping the door open to staying in the customs union. One cabinet minister told the : “The prime minister wants to find a way through this that keeps the party together. Her instinct is to stick as closely to the status quo as she can get away with. “We’ll end up with a fudge on the customs union just so we can say we’ve delivered Brexit. She just wants to kick any decisions down the road for as long as she can.”A No 10 insider added: “We want to get the right solution. This will help”. It came as Labour accused the government of “effectively subverting democracy” after an announcement of coming government business made no mention of any major Brexit-related legislation to be debated in the House of Commons.Announcing the Commons schedule for the next fortnight, Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the house, gave no timings for the return of the EU withdrawal bill from the Lords, or any news on three other key Brexit-connected bills.The inaction will reinforce the sense of a government gridlocked over the Brexit process, with no agreement in cabinet over a future customs deal with the EU, and speculation ministers might seek to delay decisions still further.This has prompted speculation that a transition period could be extended, in part to allow more time for a new customs arrangement. On Thursday, Nick Timothy, May’s former joint chief of staff, argued that this could happen, an idea immediately rejected by Downing Street.The further delays on Brexit legislation reinforces the belief that ministers hope to avoid any Commons defeats by putting off any big decisions by MPs until the government has finalised its strategy for exiting the EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50268d5738df5f896c352d603db76ea756af1291/0_218_4898_2938/master/4898.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b400c17f043993d8fd77c81681e146f4","title":"what did leaveeu do wrong and could its breaches stop brexit","story":"The Electoral Commission’s findings may carry heavier implications than a £70,000 fineLeave.EU, backed by the outspoken Ukip donor Arron Banks, was one of several pro-Brexit campaign groups founded to fight the 2016 referendum on EU membership. However, it failed in its attempt to be named the official campaign for Brexit by the Electoral Commission.This designation instead went to the rival Vote Leave group, which was allowed to spend up to £7m during the final weeks of the referendum campaign. This meant Leave.EU was reduced to being a second-tier campaign group, legally allowed to spend just £700,000 during the referendum campaign.Following a lengthy investigation the Electoral Commission has concluded Leave.EU broke this reduced spending limit by at least £70,000 and possibly substantially more. This was largely as a result of paying substantial sums to a US political consultant, Gerry Gunster, who later introduced Banks to Donald Trump at an impromptu meeting at Trump Tower in late 2016.The Electoral Commission also concluded that Banks incorrectly declared £6m worth of loans he made to the campaign group, that appropriate receipts had not been kept, and that the campaign’s chief executive, Liz Bilney, may have “knowingly or recklessly” signed an inaccurate spending return.Leave.EU’s punishment for spending too much money in the EU referendum is to have to spend a bit more now. The Electoral Commission has fined the campaign organisation a total of £70,000 for failures in its declaration, with the regulator noting the level of penalties “has been constrained by the cap on the commission’s fines”. The punishment could prompt calls for a review of election funding law, given it is relatively small for a campaign that also spent millions of pounds in the unregulated pre-referendum period. There may be a worse outcome for Bilney, a business associate of Banks who served as Leave.EU’s official campaign chief. She has been reported to the politan police for a potential criminal investigation into whether she made a false declaration on the spending return.Banks has always maintained that, while they initially attempted to hire Cambridge Analytica, this plan was dropped when Leave.EU failed to be designated as the lead Brexit group, meaning the data targeting business never actually worked on the referendum campaign.The Electoral Commission’s report largely bears this out, concluding that Leave.EU was largely bluffing about its use of Cambridge Analytica, in an attempt to make its campaign look more sophisticated. The report also suggests that the Cambridge Analytica boss, Alexander Nix, overstated his company’s association with Leave.EU in public, in the hope of winning business from the campaign group.The investigation states that despite public statements by the organisations involved there is no evidence that Cambridge Analytica had input into the Leave.EU campaign during the regulated period and “the relationship did not develop beyond initial scoping work”. Instead, the data targeting company privately asked Leave.EU to stop using its name in public, fearing the association could cause it reputational damage.However, the commission pledged to keep this aspect of the investigation under review in case further evidence about Cambridge Analytica comes to light.Almost certainly not, given it is the key policy of Theresa May’s government, although it could prompt a reform of campaign finance laws. MPs are increasingly aware that is is difficult to find appropriate punishment for breaking electoral spending laws once an election result has been declared and accepted by the public. Pro-Brexit MPs have also accused remain campaign groups of colluding to evade spending limits, although the Electoral Commission declined to investigate.Meanwhile, the official Vote Leave campaign group is facing a separate ongoing investigation into whether it broke its own £7m spending limit by channelling substantial sums of money to a fashion student during the final days of the campaign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d834808adfe310bfc26ca9b4c8e251370c190e48/0_454_2442_1465/master/2442.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77f756def0b60f718ec18f705af45c43","title":"commissioners take over cash strapped northamptonshire county council conservative party","story":"Taskforce will control Conservative-run authority for three years as financial woes biteNorthamptonshire county council is to be run by a taskforce sent by ministers as it battles to turn around its chaotic finances.The stricken Conservative-run council declared effective bankruptcy in February amid a financial crisis and it has since been forced to drain its reserves and sell its new £53m headquarters to balance the books.For the next three years, the council will have to submit all major financial and governance decisions for approval to two senior commissioners appointed by the communities secretary, James Brokenshire.Northamptonshire is seen as a test case for how ministers respond to a local authority insolvency. The National Audit Office has warned that up to 15 English councils could go bust in the next few years as cuts continue to bite.The county has banned all non-urgent spending and pushed through plans for £40m of cuts, including the unpopular closure of 21 of its 36 libraries. More cuts are expected.The government decision to send in commissioners follows a inspector’s report in March, which called for the county to be scrapped and replaced by two unitary councils. The report identified widespread management failures and lax financial controls at the council.The council’s former leader Heather Smith, who blamed the council’s predicament on government underfunding, resigned after the report was released and a new cabinet and senior management team has been appointed.In a written ministerial statement, Brokenshire said: “Action of this kind is rare and is not taken lightly, but I simply cannot ignore the scale of the problems facing Northamptonshire. It is essential residents are able to have faith in their council, particularly in the responsible use of taxpayers’ money.”He named the commissioners as Tony McArdle, former chief executive of Lincolnshire county council, and Brian Roberts, an accountant and former deputy chief executive of Leicestershire county council. They will be paid £800 and £700 a day respectively to work for two days a week.The commissioners will oversee the county council until the end of March 2021. Brokenshire said he had not ruled out appointing additional commissioners.The leader of Northamptonshire, Matthew Golby, said: “We very much welcome the intervention by the government in overseeing financial and governance arrangements at the council as this goes a long way in allaying uncertainty for staff and partners organisations. “We are very much committed to working with the government to ensure that we deliver the best services for the people of Northamptonshire, while being mindful of providing value for money for the taxpayer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8dc32016ac6377586525c736b75070d09a395a7/0_281_4743_2846/master/4743.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0e68fc24e7f51b65a3a3ca65520702f","title":"lewis hamilton zero comfortability f1 mercedes","story":"Lewis Hamilton believes he is not in a position to fight competitively for the world championship despite holding a four-point lead over his key rival, Sebastian Vettel.Preparing for the Spanish Grand Prix this weekend the Mercedes driver also criticised Formula One management for failing to consider drivers’ opinions in designing new circuits after he was disappointed by the layout for the new race in Miami next year, which was given official approval on Thursday.Hamilton took the championship lead after he inherited a win at the last round in Baku when his team-mate, Valtteri Bottas, went out with a puncture in the dying laps. It was his first victory of a season during which his team have struggled to optimise his car and tyre performance at every meeting except Australia.“I have zero comfortability. Since the last race I have not thought for one second that I am leading the world championship,” Hamilton said. “There is a long way to go. Imagine if I got excited now knowing that we still have all the problems. It doesn’t mean anything. What is important is where you are in the end.“If this weekend we happen to get on top of the issues we have with the car and start to be more consistent then I will be a lot happier because I know then I can punch either at my weight or a little bit above, but at the moment I am punching below my weight and that is not sufficient to win a world championship. We have been capitalising on circumstances like the outcome of the last race, so I will take it for now but in the long term the team cannot rely on that.”Hamilton had previously posted on social media criticising the Miami track and went further in Barcelona. “I don’t get why great golfers design golf courses but I don’t think any of the top racing drivers have ever designed a race track,” he said. “Miami is a super-cool place and I was very exited to hear about it but then I saw the layout and my reaction was: ‘Nah.’“I dread the thought of a street circuit we had like Valencia, which wasn’t great. It can be very hit and miss but maybe it will be a hit. If there is time and anyone wants to approach me or any other drivers, I am sure we can give some good insight into what the layout is like and how it could be better.

Surrey have advanced to 60-3 in the 20th over. If Elgar, who has 27, and Ben Foakes (nine) can navigate the rest of the morning without further damage, that will be a good result for the home side. As Ali watches wickets tumble at Edgbaston, it’s a similar case at Grace Road, where Leicestershire are 39-4 against Glamorgan, for whom Timm van der Gugten has a couple of wickets. After 45 frustrating minutes when Somerset bowled four no-balls and a few four balls, as well as dropping a regulation catch at second slip (“old Tresco would have caught that one”, but Matt Renshaw could not hold on), the home side has a wicket. Jimmy Adams was, as they say, adjudged caught behind off Tim Groenewald, and departed grumpily.Out came James Vince and to his second ball he played that shot and the ball flew at catchable height to third slip. There was no third slip. Since then he has played that shot more effectively and he’s raced to 27 in no time. Somerset are looking ragged and there may be a few old timers in the Colin Atkinson Pavilion shaking their heads – it’s the old players’ dinner tonight.Tom Abell, flushed by his success at Lancashire, is having a bowl, not a good sign for the home side. Hampshire are racing along at five over. Maybe that Ali Martin was right.Hang on. Abell just dismissed Weatherley for 28. Now it’s Abell against Amla. And Leach is having a bowl. 86-2Wowsers. Olly Stone enters the attack and strikes first ball with a beauty to find the edge of Adam Rossington’s bat. Fast, nipped away, found the edge of a straight defensive shot off the back foot and Northants are 47 for five, with Henry Brookes have taken two earlier and pulled off a run out to boot. Warwickshire breathing fire right now.A couple of key wickets already for Yorkshire, who have got rid of Mark Stoneman and Rory Burns – one man who is fighting to hold onto his England opening berth and the other who has made a pretty strong case to pinch it. Stoneman was lbw playing forwards at Tim Bresnan for 10 and Burns caught at first slip off a Jack Brooks’ beauty for nine. Surrey are 23-2. Swing on offer and a bit of nibble. Meanwhile, Nottinghamshire are 17-1 against Lancashire at Trent Bridge, with Steven Mullaney falling against his former county, and Essex are 21-1 against Worcestershire at New Road. Varun Chopra was the man to depart. Alluding to Vic’s earlier post ... here’s a bit of pointless but fascinating trivia on the origins of Somerset Day. Cheese lovers take note: there’s an official twitter account and hampers of cheese seem to be available to win!Henry Brookes is making some impression here at Edgbaston, with two wickets in two overs to follow the initial breakthrough from Chris Wright and leave Northants in a state of disarray at 20 for three after six overs. Wright had Ben Duckett caught behind off an inside edge before Brookes bowled Alex Wakeley with a beauty. Just nipped away a touch and trimmed the off bail. The 18-year-old, whose action is effortlessly smooth, then had Richard Levi caught at slip to another leg-cutter, as Richie Benaud would say. Marvellous effort that.It is absolutely perishing here in Malahide. I’m not sure I’ve ever been any colder at a cricket ground. So I thought I’d chip in with an update just to get the blood flowing through my fingers. The weather’s actually better than it was this morning, or at least the light has improved. But it’s still spitting, so the covers are on. The umpires are making a cursory inspection as I write this. In terms of team news, Pakistan say they’re going to play the same side that turned out against Northants, which means Imam-ul-Haq will make his debut, and they’ve a long tail, with Shadab Khan batting at No7. We know most of Ireland’s side, but haven’t heard whether they are going to pick a spinner or not. In the meantime, the players are skulking in the pavilion, the groundstaff are scurrying around trying to keep everything dry, and the fans are huddled in the stands with their hoods up. Welcome to Test cricket, Ireland. Bit of a surprise here, as Yorkshire opt for an uncontested toss and elect to bowl first. As expected, Alex Lees has come into their team in place of Gary Ballance, while Josh Shaw has come in for the injured Ben Coad, who misses out with an ankle problem. Dean Elgar returns for Surrey in place of Ryan Patel following a commitment in South Africa which forced him out of the recent Worcestershire draw here. Jade Dernbach returns in place of Stuart Meaker. A collector’s item at Taunton. Hampshire obviously wanted to bat first (a used wicket is being used for this game) so insisted upon a toss, which was duly held. Somerset won the toss and promptly put Hampshire in. So the toss was unnecessary after all.Dom Bess, who was not in the squad announced on the eve of the game, is in the team so Somerset are playing two spinners. No Mason Crane for Hampshire yet and Liam Dawson is injured.The press box is filling up on “Somerset Day” and there is great anticipation after two home victories, wins that must have come as a bit of a surprise to my esteemed colleague at Edgbaston, who had Somerset relegated in his pre-season predictions. He may yet be proven right. But he’s not completely infallible (it’s Middle Chinnock). If he happens to be wrong, I may remind him come September.Sadly they predict rain sometime in the afternoon, but the forecast not too bad thereafter.We have had a toss at Edgbaston and Northants are batting with the sun breaking through the haze. Olly Stone has indeed got the nod against his old club, so looking forward to seeing him steam in and a look at young Henry Brookes too. Highly thought of. Good morning from the Oval, where we have news. Joe Root will be captaining Yorkshire this weekend following the late withdrawal of regular captain Gary Ballance through illness.Ballance was feeling unwell and did not train with his White Rose team-mates when they arrived in London yesterday afternoon. He was assessed last night and sent home to Leeds.This will be Root’s fourth match in charge of Yorkshire in the County Championship, with the other three all coming in their title-winning season of 2014. His first was that record chase by Middlesex at Lord’s when Chris Rogers hit a double century in pursuit of 472, with him earning the nickname ‘craptain’ from his England team-mates. He then lifted the title at Nottinghamshire later in the season and skippered against Somerset, with Andrew Gale banned following a verbal altercation with Ashwell Prince in a Roses match.Alex Lees has replaced Ballance in Yorkshire’s squad and will likely open the batting. Surrey come into this match with a win and two draws from their first three matches, while Yorkshire have won two and drawn two.County cricket live is back, for what is the fifth round of matches and the last before the season switches to 50-over cricket for a spell. It’s also the final audition for any England hopefuls before Ed Smith sits down with Trevor Bayliss and Joe Root next Tuesday to pick their Test squad to face Pakistan, if national team #narrative is your thing.Anyway, greetings from a fresh and dry Edgbaston where Division Two pace-setters Warwickshire host Northamptonshire – a team they brushed aside by an innings and 48 runs at Wantage Road just three weeks ago. Be interesting to see if ex-Steelback Olly Stone, one of those hoping to catch Smith’s eye, gets a run out. The talk is it may be too soon after a hamstring twang. We’ll see.Vic Marks, meanwhile, is at Taunton. Social media tells me it’s Somerset Day today, so expect East Chinnock’s finest to take us on a stirring journey from Wookey Hole to the as-yet-constructed Hinkley Point C nuclear power station while he watches Tom Abell’s second-placed side take on Hampshire. My dud prediction of seventh for his old team will probably get an airing too. Groan.Elsewhere in Division One the battle of the blonds take place at Trent Bridge, where table-topping Nottinghamshire host Lancashire (champions-elect as per another shrewd call by yours truly) in a match that pits Stuart Broad against the peroxide pilferer Jimmy Anderson. Both were resting when the two teams met at Old Trafford in the first round and Notts gloriously romped to their fourth innings target of 10 just four wickets down.Graham Hardcastle is also on duty at the Oval, where Yorkshire take on Surrey after their epic win over Essex in the last round, while lowly Worcestershire host the champions at New Road. In Division Two, Mark Wood is back for Durham after being released early by Chennai Superkings and will be in the XI that takes on Derbyshire away, Jason Gillespie’s Sussex, as they are seemingly now known, are at south coast neighbours Kent, Leicestershire host Glamorgan and Middlesex, perhaps featuring Steven Finn and Eoin Morgan for the first time this season, play Gloucestershire at Lord’s. If Morgan plays it will end a near three-year first-class hiatus.

Whether you fancy paddleboarding around the coast or zipwiring across the treetops, here’s how to unlock a healthier, happier you this spring and summerFrom reducing blood pressure to alleviating symptoms of depression, countless studies have proved that being outdoors and in contact with nature is beneficial for both physical and mental health. In these milder months, there’s no excuse not to be outside as much as possible. Here are nine ideas for inspiration.Ride a waveThe north Cornwall coast, with its big Atlantic seas, is Britain’s premier surf destination, with Fistral beach at Newquay probably the country’s best-known surf beach. But there are great places to learn to surf all around the UK. If you’re after a board experience with a less steep learning curve, stand-up paddleboarding offers the chance to take to the water in an easy-to-learn fashion. As well as the exhilaration of surfing the waves, paddleboarding can be a means of exploring the wonders of Britain’s tranquil inland waterways.Get started: Surfing England (surfingengland.org) has information on surf clubs and learning to surf. The British Stand Up Paddle Association website (bsupa.org.uk) has information on where to learn.See colours in bloomSpring and summer are the best times to explore England’s most glorious gardens. Among the Royal Horticultural Society’s (RHS) stunners is its flagship garden, Wisley in Surrey. Home to one of the world’s largest plant collections, it’s a riot of flowering bulbs and blossoms in spring, with fragrant roses and colourful mixed borders in summer. The RHS also runs summer flower shows around the country, including the world-famous Chelsea flower show. The National Trust is  to more than 200 gardens and landscaped parks, many attached to its historic houses, with Studley Royal water gardens at Fountains Abbey, also a world heritage site, among the best known.Freewheel through forest trailsZip along peaceful country lanes between summer hedgerows, pedal past glowering mountains above Scotland’s Glencoe pass as part of a tour or expedition, race with other cyclists, or even head off-road along forest trails on a mountain bike. Cycling can provide high-adrenaline sport or light, relaxing exercise, but whichever way you ride, getting on a bike gives you an up-close view of the countryside that you’d never get from a car.Get started: Cycling UK (cyclinguk.org) can help you get on the road, with advice on everything from buying a bike to cycling groups and routes.Escape to the countryCity dwellers craving a rural fix should seek out one of the many regional annual outdoor shows, a celebration of farming and rural life, with sheep and cattle competitions, horse and dog shows, sheep-shearing contests and farm machinery displays. These days, though, the events are also packed with family-friendly entertainments, ranging from air displays and carriage-driving races to skateboarding and marching bands. Local producers showcase their food and drink, and makers display arts and crafts.Get started:UK County Shows (ukcountyshows) has countrywide information and links to inidual shows.Swim in scenic surroundingsWhat could be a more perfect summer idyll than plunging into a cool lake or river on a hot, sunny day? Wild swimming – taking a dip in rivers, lakes, streams and waterfalls – has a growing number of fans. Popular spots to swim include Ullswater in the Lake District and lochs throughout Scotland, while rivers in the Brecon Beacons are home to stunning waterfall plunge pools. In the south of England, Pangbourne on the river Thames is one of many popular locations, and there are even urban swims to be had in London’s Serpentine and Highgate ponds.Get started: There’s information on locations throughout the UK and all-important safety tips tips at wildswimming.Soar into the treetopsThere’s a special kind of thrill to hurtling through the treetops suspended on a wire. Locations range from urban parks (such as Heaton Park in Manchester and Battersea Park in London) to mountains and forests. Zip World, with locations in Wales, offers a variety of adventures through forest, over a quarry and even – this one’s for the fitter and more adventurous – underground in caverns. Go Ape has locations throughout England, Scotland and Wales, and a collection of mainly forest-based attractions.Kayak along the waterwaysBritain has thousands of miles of rivers, lakes, reservoirs and canals canoeing (single-ended paddle), or kayaking (double-ended paddle), is a great way to explore them. Assuming you don’t have your own canoe, you’ll need to join a club or go to an activity centre, where staff will generally help new paddlers with an induction session. Sea kayaking is a lot of fun, too, and more experienced paddlers may enjoy canoe polo (just as it sounds) or white-water canoeing. Get started: British Canoeing (britishcanoeing.org.uk) has information on canoe clubs and activity centres around the country, and on canoe hire.Walk this wayWhether it’s a Sunday stroll or a serious hike, there’s no simpler – or cheaper – way to explore Britain’s great outdoors than on foot. The British countryside is laced with public footpaths all you need to get going is a pair of walking boots or sturdy trainers (plus a map and weatherproof gear if you’re going far). Among myriad footpaths, 16 national trails pass through some of the country’s most iconic landscapes. They include the South West Coast Path, with 630 miles of trails snaking around the Dorset, Devon, Cornwall and Somerset coasts, and northern England’s hilly Pennine Way.Get started: National Trails (nationaltrail).

These days the biggest international names (from Beyoncé to Ed Sheeran) vie to play them: there’s no other way to see so many top artists in a single location. Glastonbury is taking a break in 2018, but there are many others picking up the slack, from Bestival to Latitude, the Isle of Wight festival, V and many more.

A good nosy at their previously unseen personal possessions and artefacts, that’s what. This summer, that’s exactly what London’s V\u0026ampA museum delivers in the much-anticipated Frida Kahlo: Making Her Self Up. The majority of this collection of jewellery, letters, photographs and items from her wardrobe (including hand-painted corsets) was only recently discovered, having been shut away for 50 years since her death. Consider this essential for demystifying the Mexican artist and sartorial icon, and it’s a lot cheaper than going all the way to Mexico. Granted, the exhibition is indoors, but you can combine your visit with a stop-off at the V\u0026ampA’s garden cafe, a hidden oasis in the centre of the museum, where you can sit at one of the courtyard tables or picnic on the lawn.vam.ac.uk from 16 JuneArrange a bouquet of flowersYou don’t have to be embarking on a second career as a florist to appreciate a beautifully arranged bunch of flowers, although a workshop at The Narcissus Flower School in Edinburgh could well send you in that direction. From learning to hand-tie a spring wedding bouquet to perfecting a festival-ready floral crown, this is the place to go this summer for cutting-edge botanical design. The highlight in the programme has to be The Foragers Garden Party workshop, which caters to all al fresco needs, from rustic barbecues to afternoon tea. Bring it on.narcissusflowers 21 June (and various dates)Learn a new craftStep away from the sandy beaches and seafood and head straight to The Studio at Burlingham Hall in Norfolk to get your hands – rather than your toes – dirty this summer. Artist Victoria Hall runs a two-day workshop for beginners in the art of paper marbling at this picturesque country estate. You’ll learn about the history, get familiar with watercolours, and tackle various paper patterns (including curl and comb designs). In fact, you’ll have a range of eclectic designs under your belt by the end.

Held in Suffolk’s picturesque Henham Park, Latitude is renowned for its eclectic arts programme, with a bit of yoga and lake swimming thrown in for good measure. This year it’s all about Bridget Christie and Tim Key in the comedy selection, while the Killers and Alt-J are definitely headliners to be reckoned with.

You can dress up, bring your own picnic (the clue is in the title), and even sleep over. With music, dancing and surprise entertainment, amid spectacular scenic views, you may even forget you’re there to watch a film.

Not that you’ll have much time to sit with your head in a book at Hay festival Wales, where Margaret Atwood leads a stellar line up of about 800 inspirational, thought-provoking discussions and panels. She’ll speak on The Handmaid’s Tale and beyond, while Philip Pullman, joined by Marina Warner and folklore academic Jack Zipes, promise tales of wonder, magic, and hope.

So what is it about Lost that people still can’t get enough of?Eight years after one of the most isive finales in television history, it feels like Lost is on the rise again. Listen hard enough and you’ll hear the sound of it being rediscovered.It’s bubbling up all over the place. New blogs and podcasts and Reddit discussions concerning themselves with various aspects of Lost have started to appear without warning. Gamers, too, seem to have suddenly rediscovered the series. This week alone, for instance, a Fortnite user found a hatch in the woods, prompting speculation of a Lost crossover, and a Far Cry 5 user recreated the Lost island in its entirety using the game’s map editor.Meanwhile, in entertainment, you can feel Lost’s influence everywhere. It’s in the knotty time structure of This Is Us. It’s in the spectacularly high concept of The Good Place, to the point that Mike Schur literally consulted Lost’s Damon Lindelof when he started to write it. It’s in the marketing push for Amazon’s The Crossing – billed as being “from the network that brought you Lost” – even though it is certainly no Lost. And if rumours are to be believed, Avengers 4 (a film all but guaranteed to be the most successful ever) is going to be heavily inspired by Lost’s fourth series.But why now? Why have I, an ardent Lost apologist since the word go, had to wait eight long and lonely years before the rest of the world caught up with me?“I took a long time to come around,” says Jack Shepherd, who co-hosts The Lost Boys podcast. The podcast’s gimmick is that Jack watches Lost for the first time, along with his die-hard fan Jacob, before discussing it. Jack dodged Lost for so long partly thanks to its weird reputation. “My older brother watched the first few seasons and gave up because he thought it quickly became awful. Most friends never made it through season five. The length of the show – 100 episodes plus – is also daunting, especially when I’ve been told there’s a lot of filler”.He has a point. Lost was never really interested in hanging around for viewers. If you missed a couple of episodes, the whole thing had a habit of making no sense whatsoever. Once, during the original run, I was discussing an episode with a friend – this was in the show’s loosey-goosey endgame, with various dimensions and donkey wheels and pendulums at play – and we had to stop because strangers were looking at us as if we were concussed.It’s also worth mentioning The Leftovers, Damon Lindelof’s Lost follow-up. Although not as highly watched as Lost – it was too bleak and weird for mainstream appeal – The Leftovers managed to win over an army of frothing devotees. It felt like a Lost concentrate, a similarly high-concept programme that didn’t feel the need to pander to a network television audience with 22-episode runs or episodes about tattoo origins. Better yet, it stuck the landing. The finale of The Leftovers is a genuinely breathtaking, emotionally satisfying piece of work that fed back into the original premise in a way that Lost couldn’t. After watching The Leftovers go out on such a soaring high point, and after just 28 episodes, of course you’d go back and give Lost a second chance. It doesn’t seem coincidental that this new rush of Lost interest has only surged now that The Leftovers is over.Both Jack and Jacob agree that we’ll never see the likes of Lost again. But that’s fine. We can live with Lost because it is everywhere now. Whenever we see Redditors sweat out elaborate Westworld theories, it’s because of Lost. Whenever we see deep-e online recaps, it’s because of Lost. Shorter, more compressed series? That’s because of Lost. Whenever there’s a flashback, or a flashforward, or a terrible Britpop band named after a mechanical component, it’s because of Lost. Lost will never die. Finally, the believers have been vindicated.

Amid all the content, though, the streaming site has steadily made its own canon of true-crime documentaries, owing to an array of innately fascinating subjects that lend themselves to binge-watching.First there was Making a Murderer, which cast doubt on a Wisconsin man’s conviction, followed by The Keepers, about the unsolved murder of a nun, and Wild, Wild Country, the story of the Oregon-based Rajneeshpuram sex cult. Now, Mark and Jay Duplass, the producers of Wild, Wild Country, boast a second, equally strange true-crime hit: Evil Genius, the bizarre tale of the “pizza bomber” heist in the appropriately named town of Erie, Pennsylvania.It begins, as those watching the news in the late summer of 2003 will remember, with a rather fruitless bank robbery: a pizza delivery man named Brian Wells walked into a PNC bank in Erie with a metal bomb collared to his neck and a cane-like shotgun in tow. Making off with around $8,000 dollars, Wells was apprehended shortly afterward in a nearby parking lot, where he told surrounding cops that the bomb around his neck was live. Incredulous witnesses heard a continuous “tick-tock”, and then it detonated, lodging shrapnel in Wells’ chest and killing him. In Wells’ car, though, authorities recovered notes that laid out a scavenger hunt, suggesting he was just a cog in an elaborate criminal machine.“I learned about it the night that it happened,” says Trey Borzillieri, the creator of Evil Genius, who’s spent more than a decade investigating the heist and its aftermath. “I was in Buffalo, which is very close to Erie, and I saw it become an international story. You’ve basically got Brian Wells delivering that pizza and then showing up at a PNC bank and robbing it. They start the investigation, then a month later there’s a body in a freezer right next to the road he made the last delivery to.“At the time, you knew this was a major story,” he adds. “So that was the moment I decided to embark on this documentary.”Borzillieri, who last year produced a docu-series on the Zodiac killer, would make the acquaintance of a remarkably idiosyncratic cast of characters along the way, none more compelling than Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong, the owl-eyed local pseudo-celebrity known for a streak of suborned, and often murdered, ex-boyfriends. An erstwhile beauty queen and musical prodigy diagnosed with bipolar disorder and mania, Diehl-Armstrong is the undisputed star of Evil Genius, if not exactly its subject, a shrewd manipulator who’s more Nannie Doss than Aileen Wuornos.“She’s very smart people would call her brilliant,” says Barbara Schroeder, who joined Borzillieri on the project in 2013. Schroeder, who wrote and directed the documentary Talhotblond, about an internet love triangle that goes south, was intrigued by the access her collaborator got to Diehl-Armstrong, whose first on-camera interview is featured in Evil Genius.“She was able to get men to do her bidding and put them under her spell,” Schroeder says. “I’m an experienced journalist, so when Trey was telling me he had years of phone calls with someone who might be the mastermind, that was just astonishing. I started listening to the audio that he got and it was just riveting.” Borzillieri and Diehl-Armstrong established a relationship before she was a public suspect, which meant she often used him as a soundboard to profess her innocence. Nevertheless, she was still a wildcard. After one phone conversation with Borzillieri, she told him: “I’ll sue your fucking balls off.” In another, she signed off with: “Love ya!” Borzillieri says: “They weren’t easy conversations, but a lot of truth was revealed ... She was such a narcissist that she always believed people would believe her side of the story.”Weeks after the Wells heist, local law enforcement received a call from Bill Rothstein, a kind of Falstaff in overalls. Portly and gregarious, Rothstein was another ex-boyfriend of Diehl-Armstrong’s who lived next door to the site of Wells’ final delivery and alerted authorities to the body of James Roden, which was frozen stiff in a freezer in his garage. Roden, too, was an ex of Diehl-Armstrong’s.“The case was cold, and it looked like Rothstein would be a definite suspect,” Borzillieri recalls. “The fact that the body was the live-in boyfriend of Marjorie’s at the time, you thought this had to be connected. But when the FBI said that it wasn’t, that’s what really compelled me to get off the couch and start knocking on doors.”Mostly, those doors begat more doors. Rich Shapiro, whose 2010 Wired exposé examines the heist comprehensively, told Borzillieri and Schroeder he needed a flow chart just to keep things straight. So, to make Evil Genius, the pair stayed faithful to chronology. They were inspired, first, by Paradise Lost, the celebrated documentary about the West Memphis Three, and second by the philosophical principle of Occam’s razor, which posits that the simplest approach is usually the best.“It was like a labyrinth, because there is more to the story than just Brian’s death,” Schroeder says. “It could have been written a lot of different ways, but we kept it really simple: here’s the heist, here’s the frozen body, here are the suspects, and here are the confessions. We thought it would be the most engaging way for people to follow Trey’s journey and these social misfits who basically outplayed the FBI.”Among the many subnarratives coursing through the docuseries, which touches on issues of class stratification and mental illness, is the tension between the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and local law enforcement, whose collective attempts to solve the mystery of the heist were marred by a lack of forensic evidence, the deaths of key witnesses, and their own internecine disputes. “This is the first time that many of these investigators have gone on camera to tell their story,” says Borzillieri. “Because of the sensitive nature of this case, all law enforcement you see interviewed waited until they were retired to speak.”The access Borzillieri secured, including unprecedented on-camera interviews with law enforcement, Diehl-Armstrong, and a key witness who surfaces in the fourth episode, reflected the kind of genuine, leather-shoe reporting he conducted from the get-go. “Even though he’s a citizen journalist, I enjoyed working with him more than a lot of other colleagues throughout my career,” says Schroeder. “The first time anybody tells their story, if you catch that on camera, that’s a pretty special moment. To Trey’s credit, it’s good old-fashioned journalism.”Borzillieri and Schroeder are happy that Evil Genius landed at Netflix, where true-crime junkies will be able to binge all four episodes in full. “We’re grateful to get that many eyeballs on this one-of-a-kind crime,” says Schroeder, “and, creatively, to be able to tell the story the way it should be told.”“I would add that, embarking on this, there weren’t a lot of documentary series at the time,” Borzillieri notes. “There was a lot of blind faith on my part. Making a Murderer revolutionized this kind of film-making and, in essence, I no longer look like a crazy person carrying a project like this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d74635154c440c9d0f706d97c62131d1162de806/22_0_1198_719/master/1198.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb1ce42fcb18d07cd025edc7e6d42d8b","title":"rick and morty renewed for 70 more episodes adult swim","story":"Cult animation has been re-ordered by Adult Swim in deal which could keep the critically lauded sci-fi satire on screens for a decadeCartoon Network and Justin Roiland, co-creator of the series, have announced that they will be making another 70 episodes of cult hit animated show Rick and Morty. The order represents a tripling of the total amount of Rick And Morty available: the first three seasons consisted of a total of 31 episodes.The show’s co-creator Dan Harmon told GQ that the 70-episode deal came after a long negotiation process. “It was a lot of back and forth, but Justin and I just needed enough episodes and the right kind of deal structure that would give us permission to do what we want to do, which is truly focus on the show,” he said.“We got all that, and we’re both very excited.”It is yet to be announced how the new episodes will be broken into season, or the timeframe for their production and broadcast - a fact alluded to in Roiland’s tweeted announcement. If the new episodes follow the pattern of being made in blocks of ten or eleven episodes over 18-month periods, it could see the show remaining on air for the best part of a decade. While fans could reasonably have expected the sci-fi satire to be renewed, given its success, the size of the order is a surprise. The animation is shown on the Cartoon Network’s Adult Swim channel - and is ranked as one of the most watched shows among the millennial audience.First transmitted in 2013, the animated series follows the adventures of scientist Rick and his grandson Morty, as they travel to different dimensions. It borrows loosely from the dynamic of the Back To The Future movies, having originated in a short parody of that film.The show has inspired a massive fandom online, and last year led to chaos when a limited edition McDonald’s Szechuan dipping sauce re-released as a promotional stunt after being mentioned in the show wasn’t produced in enough quantities to satisfy enthusiasts.

Moreover, they had also been involved in the kidnap and severe mistreatment of the men’s wives, Fatima Boudchar and Karima al-Saadi, and Saadi’s four children, the youngest aged six.

In between, Blair had paid his first visit to Tripoli, embracing Gaddafi and declaring that they were making “common cause” against al-Qaida and terrorism.These documents nailed as a lie the mantra that British government officials repeated whenever allegations of involvement in post-911 human rights abuses were raised: that the government did not “participate in, solicit, encourage or condone” the use of torture. Three years after the two rendition operations – and six years before the discovery of the secret files in Tripoli – Jack Straw, then foreign secretary, told MPs that media reports about the abuses were “conspiracy theories”, and that “there simply is no truth in the claims that the United Kingdom has been involved in rendition”.The discovery in the ESO’s outpost put a stop to such denials. They showed that MI6 had provided the intelligence that allowed the CIA to abduct Belhaj and Saadi, the two leaders of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. The LIFG was an Islamist militia that had rejected al-Qaida’s global agenda, focusing instead on the overthrow of Gaddafi, and had been something of an ally of the UK until the 911 attacks in New York turned the global geopolitical order upside down.Copies of the Tripoli papers were handed to two London law firms, and claims brought against not only the foreign office and MI6, but also against Straw and Sir Mark Allen, the former head of counter-terrorism at MI6.The government announced that the Libyan renditions would be among the cases investigated by the Gibson inquiry, established the previous year to examine allegations of UK’s involvement in human rights abuses during counter-terrorism operations.A few months later, Scotland Yard announced it too was investigating MI6’s involvement in the rendition operations. At this point, the government shelved the Gibson inquiry, maintaining that it could not continue its work while a police investigation was under way. Instead, the intelligence and security committee, a group of MPs and peers said to provide oversight of the intelligence agencies, would examine the matter. The committee is yet to report.It was clear from the outset that the main suspect in the police inquiry would be Allen, whose name appeared on a number of the letters that had been faxed to Gaddafi’s head of intelligence, Moussa Koussa.Notoriously, Allen had sent a fax in which he congratulated Koussa on the “safe arrival” of Belhaj. “This was the least we could do for you and for Libya to demonstrate the remarkable relationship we have built over recent years.” He added that “amusingly”, the CIA – which had provided the aircraft for one of the rendition operations – had asked that MI6 channel all requests for information from Belhaj through them.“I have no intention of doing any such thing,” he said. “The intelligence … was British. I know I did not pay for the air cargo. But I feel I have the right to deal with you direct on this.”Boudchar gave an interview to the  in which she explained how that air cargo’s safe arrival was achieved. She and her husband had been taken off a flight in Bangkok and led to a detention centre somewhere within the airport. While her husband was being tortured, she was hooded and chained to a wall for five days, given water, but starved.Her captors were three masked Americans, two men and a woman. “They knew I was pregnant,” she said. “It was obvious.” She was forced to lie on a stretcher before the flight to Tripoli, and bound, head to foot, with sticky tape. “My left eye was closed when the tape was applied, but my right eye was open. It was agony.”The flight took 17 hours. Throughout the journey, Boudchar could hear her husband grunting in pain: he had been shackled in a way that ensured he could neither lie nor sit. On landing they were driven separately to prison. Belhaj says the torture began immediately. Boudchar was freed shortly before giving birth.Saadi’s eldest daughter, Khadija, told the  how her family had also been forced on to an aircraft. She was 12 years old at the time. She and her brothers, Mostapha, 11, and Anes, nine, and her sister, Arowa, six, were told not to speak to each other.“My mother was crying. She told me they were taking us to Libya. I was very scared. I thought my mother and father were going to be tortured and we would all be killed. I was told to say goodbye to my father. He was handcuffed to a seat in another compartment and had a drip in his arm. One of the Libyan intelligence officers was laughing at me.”Khadija, her mother, and her siblings were held for two and a half months. Belhaj and Saadi were detained for six years, and say they were repeatedly tortured. They were also asked a series of questions that both MI6 and MI5 drew up and handed over to the ESO. There were more than 1,600 of these questions: these too were part of the serendipitous discovery at the abandoned ESO outpost.British intelligence officers also interrogated the men in person. Left alone on one occasion with his British questioners, Belhaj says he conveyed through sign language that he was being suspended by his arms and beaten. The British clearly understood, he says: one gave a thumbs-up sign, while the other nodded her head.Analysis of the Tripoli papers shows that the rendition operations were just part of the rapprochement between London and Tripoli, which appears to have been a complex affair driven more by intelligence officers than diplomats. There were efforts also to persuade Gaddafi to abandon his nuclear and chemical weapons ambitions, as well as oil and gas exploration deals, trade agreements and personal relationships.Among the files was a letter from Blair to Gaddafi – “Dear Muammar”, it began – thanking him for their countries’ intelligence officers’ “excellent cooperation” and expressing regret that the English courts had again declined to deport a member of the LIFG. The Tripoli papers show that some of the questions that had been handed to the Libyans were intended to elicit information that could justify the detention and attempted deportation of LIFG members who had resided peacefully in the UK for many years. Despite the wealth of documentary evidence of UK involvement in these abuses, the government resisted the claim brought by Belhaj and Boudchar. By the beginning of last year, the government had spent £750,000 defending it, including £110,000 defending Allen and £26,500 defending Straw.It appears ministers and government lawyers resisted the claims not because they were reluctant to make payments – Saadi settled for £2.2m in 2012 – but because they did not wish to apologise. Belhaj made clear that he did not want money – and has not received any – but he did want an apology, especially for his wife.That was difficult as long as the police investigation was under way: if the government admitted liability, it was difficult to see how someone would not be charged with a criminal offence. Doubtless this was an appalling vista in the minds of many in Whitehall.When the Crown Prosecution Service decided against prosecuting Allen – much to the anger of some detectives on the case – Belhaj’s lawyers sought a judicial review of the decision, and so an apology remained unthinkable.Thursday’s settlement included an agreement that the bid for a judicial review would be abandoned: the path was finally clear for an apology and a settlement of the long-running case. But did the secret collaboration between MI6 and ESO bear fruit?On the one hand, some involved in the rendition operations claim they were part of a process that led to Gaddafi abandoning his WMD programme – although he actually did that three months earlier.On the other hand, one of the documents discovered in Tripoli was an MI5 assessment of the LIFG, written 10 months after the two families had been abducted. Marked “Secret, UKLibya Eyes Only”, the report concluded candidly that while the detention of the two men had cast the LIFG into disarray, it had also pushed it closer to al-Qaida and its pan-Islamist, anti-western agenda."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cb5ba89d55f368786cd2c8e4948eceb8518d869/0_14_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76301956837a6940f59fe5a4d7ca64bb","title":"us issues apology after canadian minister told to take off turban at airport","story":"Navdeep Bains, a cabinet minister, said he refused to take off his turban after he had already passed through regular security checksOfficials from the Trump administration issued an apology after a security agent at a Detroit airport repeatedly demanded that a Canadian cabinet minister remove his turban, the minister has revealed. Navdeep Bains, the country’s minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development, described the incident in an interview with the French-language paper La Presse on Thursday.Bains was returning to Toronto after meetings with Michigan state leaders in April 2017 and had already passed through regular security checks, but because he was wearing a turban, a security agent told him that he would have to undergo additional checks, according to La Presse. “He told me to take off my turban. I asked him why I would have to take off my turban when the metal detector had worked properly,” the minister said. The US amended its travel policy in 2007, allowing Sikhs to keep turbans on while passing during the security inspection process.He refused the agent’s request to remove his turban: “I believed that it was an intrusion into my private life … They would never ask me to take off my clothes,” he said. The agent eventually relented. Bains said that when he travels, he rarely discloses his identity as a cabinet minister, in order to better understand the travel experiences – and frustrations – of people not afforded similar privileges. When he appeared at his scheduled gate, a second security agent approached him, requesting Bains return to the security checkpoint – and again telling him to remove his head-covering.“He told me: ‘You have to take off your turban.’ I responded politely that it was not a security threat and that I had passed all the security controls. Then he asked for my name and identification. I reluctantly gave him my diplomatic passport.”It was the moments that followed which most incensed Bains. “I was speechless … I was at the point of boarding and they asked me to take off my turban. But upon learning of my diplomatic status, they told me that everything is fine. That’s not a satisfactory response.”The incident prompted foreign affairs minister Chrystia Freeland to express disappointment to her US counterparts. Both undersecretaries for the homeland security and transportation departments apologized for the incident. Canada has more Sikh ministers than any other country in the world. In the 2015 election, 20 Sikhs were elected members of parliament and four – Bains, Harjit Sajjan, Amarjeet Sohi and Bardish Chagger – were appointed as federal ministers. “Unfortunately these types of incidents do occur from time to time to minorities in particular. But it should never become the norm,” Bains said in a statement. “I will continue to promote ersity and inclusion across the country as our government has done since we took office. It is exactly why I ran for office.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96f40a084a529c378868ac82dd7ca2f1789262f1/0_132_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f47ea35a41ada3a9407ba3d708f3d5e7","title":"brazil lula guilherme boulos youngest president","story":"Guilherme Boulos, only 35, has a slim chance in the October election, but he’s already seen as a potential successor – by Lula himselfIt sounds like the longest of long shots. Guilherme Boulos has never stood for political office of any kind, but he is somehow now aiming for the very top job. “Clearly, it’s a David v Goliath battle,” the 35-year-old social activist admits of his unlikely quest to become Brazil’s youngest ever president. “But it’s something that we must face.”Polls leave no doubt that Boulos – who is running alongside indigenous activist Sônia Guajajara for the leftist Socialism and Liberty party – has a wafer-thin chance of achieving his goal when Latin America’s biggest democracy votes on 7 October. In the longer term, however, the São Paulo-born politician’s prospects look far brighter. As Brazil’s crisis-stricken left comes to terms with the sidelining of its torchbearer, former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Boulos is being touted as a potential successor – not least by Lula himself.In his last public speech before being jailed last month, Lula clutched Boulos’s hand and urged supporters to take note of this “companheiro of the highest quality”. Turning to Boulos next to him on stage, Lula added: “You’ve got a bright future, brother, just don’t ever give up.”Lula made no fewer than five allusions to the activist during that parting address, Piauí magazine noted in a recent profile proclaiming Boulos “o herdeiro” or “the heir”: “Nobody was mentioned or praised as much.”Boulos, who shares Lula’s eventually relinquished love of smoking and the Corinthians football club as well as his legendary charisma, has downplayed that nickname, while recognising parallels between his 16-year struggle for social justice with the Homeless Workers’ Movement (MTST) and Lula’s championing of the poor. “Only the dead have heirs,” Boulos said during a high-profile television interview this week.But that widely applauded TV appearance only intensified chatter over Boulos’s status as Lula’s inheritor. In an article headlined “The Star is Born”, political journalist Luis Nassif celebrated “the birth of a national leader”. Leonardo Boff, a leftist theologian and longtime Lula confidant, seconded the emotion, tweeting: “You are a new leadership in Brazil.” During a recent interview with the  – conducted while clattering around Rio in the back of a silver Honda compact – Boulos spoke of his desire to lead a long-term renewal of Brazil’s left, a movement at a crossroads after losing its leader of nearly four decades. He insisted his presidential bid was a genuine attempt to gain power and hoped the anti-systemic frustrations rippling across the globe might boost his campaign. “People are tired of the the same old marketing tricks. People no longer have faith in the old ways of doing politics. This opens up an possibility,” said Boulos. “This is an election in which anything is possible.”Boulos said combating “pornographic” levels of inequality would be his priority as president. “Brazil is the world’s seventh biggest economy and yet also one of the 10 most unequal,” he said as his car sped past Jacarezinho, a vast redbrick favela, on its way to the family home of murdered Rio councillor Marielle Franco. “Brazil isn’t just one country,” Boulos added that afternoon. “Brazil is a fissure. Brazil is an abyss.”On the campaign trail, Boulos, who holds a master’s in psychiatry from one of Brazil’s top universities, has been doing plenty of that. After spending the morning with Franco’s sister and parents, he set off for a round table discussion with leftwing artists and activists who served up a bewildering smorgasbord of demands.One called for academic quotas for Brazil’s transgender community another demanded action against tyrannical media oligopolies a third protested that the swimming pool of a local state school had become a dumping site for old sofas and dead dogs.“We must roll up our sleeves, hang our pants on the washing line and demand from the government what is ours!” a fourth petitioner bellowed to furrowed brows and giggles.Throughout the meandering session Boulos sat attentively taking notes before ending with a brief but rousing address delivered in a silky baritone not unlike that of his incarcerated political patron.The would-be president railed against corruption, racism, gender discrimination, the “stupid” war on drugs and the failings of Brazil’s inward-looking left which spent too much time “preaching to the converted”.“We’re in a moment of transition. We’re entering a new cycle,” intoned Boulos, whose purple T-shirt carried the words of the German playwright Bertolt Brecht: “Nothing should seem impossible to change.” When Lula’s increasingly apparent heir concluded he was cheered off the stage and mobbed for selfies. Back in his Honda and heading to Rio’s airport, Boulos said his travels around Brazil had convinced him the country needed a leader capable of hearing “the clamour of the people”. “Perhaps one of the characteristics of our failed political system is that it is deaf … Politics is full of people who can come out and make big speeches … but someone who wants to govern a country must really know that country and listening is essential to knowing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00696fa5a396e80786683d17dfe304f8e1e85e4b/0_0_3650_2190/master/3650.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6e34f38be6b42b427d5057c1592fa0d","title":"carles puigdemont proposes quim torra successor catalonia government","story":"Unionists dismiss Quim Torra as puppet of former president and point to controversial tweetsThe deposed Catalan president Carles Puigdemont has anointed a new candidate as his successor, raising hopes that the region could have a government as early as next week after five months of legal and political impasse.Quim Torra, a close ally and former leader of the pro-independence grassroots group Òmnium Cultural, was announced by Puigdemont on Thursday night.Catalonia has been without a government since the regional election in December, which was called by the Spanish government after it sacked Puigdemont’s administration in response to its independence referendum and subsequent unilateral declaration of independence. However, the move backfired after the three secessionist parties held on to their parliamentary majority.Attempts to form a new government have so far come to nothing. Puigdemont remains in self-imposed exile, facing possible extradition in Spain over his role in the push for independence, while two other presidential candidates – Jordi Sànchez and Jordi Turull – are still on remand.Although Torra faces no such legal barriers, Puigdemont acknowledged that his latest candidate would not have an easy ride.The first investiture debate will be held at noon on Saturday. However, as Torra does not have the necessary support to win an absolute majority in the subsequent vote, there will be a second debate on Monday, which requires only a simple majority for victory.Torra said he was honoured by Puigdemont’s confidence, referring to him as “the legitimate president of Catalonia”.His anointment was swiftly dismissed by unionist parties in Catalonia. The centre-right Citizens party, which took the largest share of the vote in the December election, described Torra as Puigdemont’s puppet and pointed out that he had written a string of controversial tweets six years ago. Among them were: “Spaniards know only how to plunder” “It’s been quite a while since Spaniards removed the word shame from the dictionary”, and “We’ve been living under Spanish occupation since 1714”.The Catalan Socialist party said it would not support Torra, whom it described as one of “the most sectarian” voices in the pro-independence bloc.Ada Colau, the mayor of Barcelona, called on Torra to apologise for his anti-Spanish remarks. “Perhaps Quim Torra is Puigdemont’s most faithful candidate, but Catalonia needs a president with a capacity for dialogue and reconciling the country,” she tweeted on Thursday.If Torra did attend parliament to be invested, she added, he ought to begin by saying sorry for his “ethnicist” comments that were offensive to millions of Catalans.The region will have to return to the polls in July if a government is not in place by 22 May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd77bb1f9013a881668aa45661e229cf37e8d972/489_568_3820_2292/master/3820.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7427e56bf778e52b33007fece0e9415e","title":"chinese broadcaster loses eurovision rights over lgbt censorship","story":"Mango TV blacked out performance featuring two male dancers during semi-finalThe European Broadcasting Union has blocked a Chinese broadcaster from airing the Eurovision song contest after it edited out LGBT elements from an online stream of the semi-finals on Tuesday.Mango TV, a video-streaming site linked to one of China’s most watched channels, Hunan TV, blacked out the performance of Ireland’s Ryan O’Shaugnessy, during which two male dancers depicted a fraught relationship. The site also pixellated a rainbow flag waved during another performance. The EBU said on Friday it had terminated its partnership with Mango TV because the censorship was not in line with its “values of universality and inclusivity and our proud tradition of celebrating ersity through music”. Conservative attitudes towards LGBT issues in China are slowly changing. Homosexuality was decriminalised in 1997 and removed from the government’s list of mental disorders in 2001, but discrimination and practices such as forced gay conversion therapy are still used.Last month, LGBT activists pushed the popular microblog Weibo to reverse a ban on gay content. Hunan TV, known for its progressiveness, has previously made shows featuring LGBT content.Although Eurovision is not widely popular in China, news of the censorship circulated around social media on Friday. One Weibo user wrote: “Is this really that sensitive? If things keep going this way, soon even rainbows in the sky will have to be blurred out.”Another wrote: “SARFT is really disgusting,” referring to the country’s entertainment regulator, the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television. It is unclear whether regulators ordered Hunan TV not to show O’Shaugnessy’s performance or whether the channel made the decision independently.Hunan TV purchased the rights to broadcast the contest for the first time in 2016 and one of its executives told ESC Daily, a website reporting Eurovision-related news, that she hoped China would follow in Australia’s footsteps and one day be invited to compete."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca0088006b548ae83dd16d79803a56be8dac5675/0_64_2834_1700/master/2834.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43195693e2af168be4b78f629f8c207f","title":"moldova pm pavel filip rules out reunification romania","story":"Pavel Filip opposed to tie-up with neighbour despite growing calls for countries to uniteMoldova’s government has ruled out reunification with Romania despite a surge in demands for the two countries to unite.The prime minister, Pavel Filip, said Moldova’s place was as a sovereign state, independent of Romania. “Too much has been said about reunification, identity, language and I want to look at the concrete development of the country,” he told the . “All those problems that are sentiment related should be left for better times.”A pro-unification rally in Moldova’s capital, Chișinău, last month attended by 10,000 people, including the former Romanian president Traian Băsescu.Romania’s parliament two days later cast a symbolic vote for reunification and MPs said they would welcome any such move by Moldova. The events were timed to coincide with the 100th anniversary of Moldova joining the then kingdom of Greater Romania.A former head of a tobacco company, Filip aspires to bring Moldova into the European Union. The former Soviet territory, the poorest country in Europe, lags far its behind neighbours – including Romania, which joined the EU in 2007. Nevertheless he predicted: “We will be together with Romania in the EU.”The country that is now Moldova has been buffeted by powerful neighbours for centuries, whether Ottoman sultans or Russian tsars. Once known as Bessarabia, the territory became part of Greater Romania in 1918, but came under Soviet control in 1940.It emerged as an independent country in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since then it has been grappling with poverty, corruption and the frozen conflict in the eastern Russian-speaking enclave of Transnistria.Moldova is still torn between those seeking closer ties with Russia, such as its president, Igor Dodon, and Filip, who believes pro-European parties will prevail in parliamentary elections this autumn. “At the end of my mandate we will see that this EU road is not debatable but irreversible,” he said.The prime minister was speaking on a visit to Brussels to discuss the association agreement Moldova signed with the EU in 2014. EU officials expressed concern about Moldova’s slow progress in bringing to justice criminals who embezzled $1bn (£740m) from the country’s banks, known locally as “the theft of the century”.The EU’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said it was “difficult for us to understand” the delays in the investigating the crime. “It is about the credibility of the anti-corruption reforms in Moldova,” she said.The scandal brought down two former prime ministers in Filip’s party, propelling him to office in January 2016.EU officials also voiced regret that Moldova ignored warnings from Council of Europe experts that a new electoral law risked allowing wealthy businesspeople undue influence over elections. Moldova’s decision to press ahead with the law contributed to the EU freezing €100m in funds.The prime minister said the topic was closed and that he expected Moldova to meet conditions allowing it access the EU loans and grants."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/895db25d0142afff11b9219e544d94cb4034537b/0_7_3059_1837/master/3059.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c1fb8e488236357466bbc1c5a292a7a","title":"single women a burden on the state says japanese mp","story":"Kanji Kato criticised for telling women to have multiple children as birth rate falls to lowest level since 1899An MP from Japan’s governing party has drawn accusations of sexism after he said women should have multiple children and warned those who preferred to remain single that they would become a burden on the state later in life.Kanji Kato, a member of prime minister Shinzo Abe’s Liberal Democratic party, told a party faction meeting that when he is asked to give speeches at wedding receptions, he encourages the bride and groom to produce “at least three children”.When he encounters young women who say they do not intend to marry, Kato, who has six children and eight grandchildren, said: “I tell them that if they don’t get married then they won’t be able to have children, and that they’ll end up in a care home paid for with the taxes of other people’s children.”His comments, reported by TBS News, come days after official data showed the number of children in Japan fell to its lowest on record. As of 1 April 2018 there were 15.53 million children aged under 15, a fall of 170,000 from the previous year, according to the internal affairs ministry.Last year about 941,000 children were born in Japan, the lowest number since records began in 1899.The country’s birthrate remains stubbornly low despite the introduction of financial and other incentives to encourage couples to have bigger families.Kato, 72, is not the first Japanese politician to suggest that women should regard producing offspring as their primary role in life.In 2007 the then health minister, Hakuo Yanagisawa, described women as “birth-giving machines” and said it was their public duty to increase the birthrate.Kato, a former vice minister at the agriculture ministry, initially said he stood by his remarks after female MPs branded them sexist.

Photograph: ReutersYves Herman Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has defended his lack of contact with the British prime minister Theresa May for the past six weeks, despite the ongoing Brexit crisis and the suspended Belfast institutions.Mr Varadkar said that he and Ms May had each other’s mobile numbers and could contact each other whenever they needed to. “Currently the focus is on negotiations in Brussels and on the various cabinet meetings that are happening in the UK to determine what its position will be on the customs union, or a customs union partnership, and how that position might evolve,” he said.A meeting “is under consideration for next week” if they are both in Sofia, Bulgaria at the same time. But “the most useful conversation is the one which will be had once the British government has decided its position on the new customs arrangement”. Until then “it is very hard to make any particular progress at the moment”.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, who raised the issue in the Dáil, believed it was probably the only time in the past quarter of a century that leaders on both sides went so long without speaking, particularly during such a period of crisis.He expressed concern at the lack of communication, saying that the absence of the anti-Brexit majority in the North from any major discussions “causes damage every day”.And he said it was very surprising given the threat posed by an absent Northern Executive, and by the British government’s refusal to establish consultation processes with Dublin over the suspension, that the Taoiseach had had no contact with Ms May.Mr Martin, a former minister for foreign affairs, said the British-Irish intergovernmental conference should have been convened by now and the maximum use of the Belfast Agreement was imperative.“Otherwise, elements of the agreement can fall into abeyance and that ultimately brings the agreement itself into disrepute,” he warned.His call was echoed by Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald who said that while it was “no silver bullet”, a forum was needed to provide a roadmap.Green party Eamon Ryan said the lack of contact for six weeks was “remarkable” and he called on the Taoiseach to engage with the smaller parties including his own colleagues in the North. “Relying on the big two” – the DUP and Sinn Féin – “is not clever at this time”, Mr Ryan said.The Taoiseach said there was a lot of contact at official and political levels. He told Mr Ryan he welcomed forces in the North other than unionist or nationalist but said they had to have regard to parties’ mandate when organising meetings.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"New PM Mahathir Mohamad says king is willing to pardon rival turned allyBodies of three adults and four children found near tourist town of Margaret RiverTeaching English in China can be tricky affair due to unregulated agenciesMahathir, the oldest elected leader in world, ends ruling coalition\u0026rsquos six-decade reignUS president promises \u0026lsquospecial moment for world peace\u0026rsquo when leaders meet on June 12thSome of over 100 protesters in Almaty carried banners saying \u0026lsquoFreedom to political prisoners\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoStop torture\u0026rsquoUS secretary of state returning with \u0026lsquothree wonderful gentlemen\u0026rsquo, says TrumpPM Najib Razak\u0026rsquos party loses seats in key states, raising prospect he could be voted outDual citizens are blocked from national elected office under Australia\u0026rsquos 117-year-old constitutionMeeting signals China\u0026rsquos desire for influence ahead of planned Kim-Trump summitChongqing party boss Sun Zhengcai took millions in bribes, court saysAhsan Iqbal (59) is attacked by a gunman during an election rally in Punjab provincePresident says philosopher\u0026rsquos theory still holds true on 200th anniversaryWorkers have started to restore electricity as homes, crops extensively damaged herds killedLiu Xia despairs as talks to free her from house arrest appear to stallMany of the deceased hit by collapsing walls, trees in north and west of countryAnti-ship and surface-to-air systems set-up on reclaimed land in South China Sea, reports sayIndian court tells government to enlist overseas specialists to fix pollution damageReuters journalists working on investigation into killing of Rohingya men and boys were arrested in DecemberAustralian Cardinal is most senior Vatican official to be charged over sex abuse in Catholic Church"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"People in Tehran are at the mercy of Trump\u0026rsquos whims and their own hardline leadersIsraeli military says it launched barrage after \u0026lsquo20 rockets\u0026rsquo fired at bases in Golan HeightsSunni Arab minority feels alienated ahead of election for parliament and prime ministerReformist president Hassan Rouhani has vowed to continue abiding by the agreementFrench president Macron proclaims determination to Iranian president over accordUS \u0026lsquowill be putting on among the strongest sanctions that we\u0026rsquove ever put on a country\u0026rsquoIran\u0026rsquos president says his country is ready to produce more nuclear fuel if necessary\u0026lsquoDeath to America\u0026rsquo chanted after Donald Trump pulled out of nuclear dealTrump\u0026rsquos decision sets stage for resurgence of political infighting in Iran\u0026rsquos power structureReaction: Trump demand that allies fall into line could cause a considerable rift with EUIsrael\u0026rsquos education minister responds to poll outcome by saying \u0026lsquoHizbullah  Lebanon\u0026rsquoThousands of Lebanese braved traffic, confusion and chaos to take part in long overdue electionGrowing signals that US may withdraw from agreement Donald Trump has called \u0026lsquoworst ever\u0026rsquoBuild-up of methane gas is blamed for blasts at two separate sitesAnother coalition government of most parties that have ruled since 2016 is likelySeveral \u0026lsquofirsts\u0026rsquo in the Middle East country\u0026rsquos first parliamentary election in nine yearsPalestinians gather for sixth March of Return protestMahmoud Abbas suggests Jews not persecuted on religious grounds, but because of their conductWashington risks conflict with Russia and Iran, President Assad\u0026rsquos chief backersDrive to push out terror group was halted in January when Turkey began Afrin offensive"},{"url":null,"title":"national geographic travel photographer year 2018 pictures","story":"The competition continues in the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest!

He criticised Eastern European countries for refusing EU migrant relocation quotas, while praising Italy and Greece, which have borne the brunt of the migration crisis.“I was shocked by the cracks that have emerged in the solidarity since the migration crisis,” said Mr Juncker, who declared that the world needed “more Europe” and a “strong Europe”.He said: “There are part time Europeans. At times they participate, at times they don’t. They talk a lot. I would like that all Europeans, all member states, were pro-Europeans in a full time way.”Antonio Tajani, the Italian president of the European Parliament, gave an explicit warning to the prospective new government at the conference. “A referendum to get out of monetary union,” he said, “is really irresponsible, really irresponsible. Look at what is happening in Argentina at the moment. You cannot play with fire.”“Going out of Europe does not make sense, as going out of the Economic and Monetary Union doesn’t make sense,” said Mr Tajani, who was tipped to be Silvio Berlusconi’s choice for Italian prime minister had the Forza Italia party won the election.The centre right Forza and centre left Democratic Party led by Matteo Renzi, another former Italian prime minister, were soundly rejected in favour of the anti-establishment Five Star and League in March.On Thursday, Italy\u0027s president Sergio Mattarella warned that the only answer to problems such as the migration crisis, which has hit Italy and Greece the hardest, was the EU.To believe one can go it alone is pure illusion, or even worse, a wilful hoax against public opinion, Mr Mattarella said. Everyone knows that none of the great challenges facing our continent can be tackled by any single member state on its own.Mr Mattarella had suggested forming a caretaker administration to break the impasse on forming Italy\u0027s government, which spurred Five Star and The League, the two parties who performed the best at the polls, into coalition talks.On Wednesday the influential Mr Berlusconi said he would not back such a coalition, which would have a slim majority, but would not oppose it either.Please review our commenting policyAn all-out war between Israel and Iran would pit a high-tech military against a resourceful foeRoyal wedding guest list: Who did Meghan Markle and Prince Harry invite?Ken Bruce on Eurovision and his heady days at the Beeb: \u0026#39People would read the news drunk\u0026#39Chinese TV channel banned from airing Eurovision after \u0026#39censoring rainbow flags\u0026#39 Watford driver guilty of GBH after hitting moped rider who he had bad feelings with ‘over a girl’ Prince Philip pictured for first time since leaving hospital as he attends Royal Windsor Horse ShowAirline\u0026#39s decision to scrap tomato juice sparks passenger outrageFlash floods sweep away cars in TasmaniaLeave.EU campaign group fined £70,000 for breachingDog shoots man in US while ‘horsing around’ with owner on sofa Crossrail 2: TfL \u0026#39levy\u0026#39 could force nearby home owners to stump up millions for projectHow tourism in Iran blossomed after the nuclear deal – and what the future holds for the fragile industryPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s Royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest news\u0026#39You upset my missus!\u0026#39: Ukip politicans swear at each other over alleged \u0026#39stripper\u0026#39 insult US Mother\u0026#39s Day 2018: How the campaign was won – and the woman behind it turned against her life\u0026#39s workPotholes a \u0026#39national disgrace\u0026#39 and costing drivers and insurers £1m a month, AA warnsGrammar school expansion will create up to 16,000 new places, Education Secretary revealsWhat time is the Royal wedding?

The Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority said in April that they would fine the lender’s boss for breaching conduct rules when he tried to identify a whistleblower. Mr Staley tried to find out who wrote two anonymous letters, which were sent to the board and a senior executive in June 2016. The letters, considered to be whistleblowing, raised concerns about a senior employee who had been recruited by Barclays earlier that year.Mark Steward, FCA executive director of enforcement and market oversight, said: “Given the crucial role of the chief executive, the standard of due skill, care and diligence is more demanding than for other employees.“Mr Staley breached the standard of care required and expected of a chief executive in a way that risked undermining confidence in Barclays’ whistleblowing procedures. Chief executives must act with a high degree of care and prudence at all times. Mr Steward added: “Whistleblowers play a vital role in exposing poor practice and misconduct in the financial services sector. It is critical that iniduals are able to speak up anonymously and without fear of retaliation if they want to raise concerns.”The PRA’s chief executive Sam Woods said: “Protection for whistleblowers is an essential part of keeping the financial system safe and sound.  Mr Staley’s behaviour fell below the standard we require, resulting in today’s fine and public censure. In addition, Barclays is now subject to special requirements to report to the PRA and FCA how it handles its whistleblowing cases in the coming years.”Barclays: Can whistleblowers be confident after FCA warns CEO Staley?Barclays boss Jes Staley to be fined over whistleblower scandalGovernment lambasted for trumpeting prosecution of whistleblowerThe Barclays board said it had reduced the value of Mr Staley’s “variable compensation” - meaning his annual bonus - by £500,000 following the regulators’ decision. Mr Staley said: I have consistently acknowledged that my personal involvement in this matter was inappropriate, and I have apologised for mistakes which I made. I accept the conclusions of the board, the FCA, and the PRA, following their respective investigations, and the sanctions which they have each applied.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The cost of the wedding itself – the food, the Ralph \u0026amp Russo Couture dress etc – will be picked by the Royal Family.But the security costs have been estimated at more than £20m. And that will be borne by the public purse.Yet the wedding might also attract additional tourists from abroad, whose expenditure will help defray some of those public costs.Some have even claimed that sales of memorabilia will boost the overall economy.Which leaves us with the perennial questions: How much money do we spend on the British monarchy? How much of an asset is it to the economy? Is the Royal Family really “worth it”?How much does the Royal Family cost the taxpayer?Direct funding to meet the monarchy’s official expenditure is now through something called the “Sovereign Grant”.This replaced the old Civil List and grants-in-aid from government departments in 2012 and is supposed to be reviewed every five years.In 2016-17 the Sovereign Grant was £42.8m, rising to £76m in 2017-18, with the increase difference earmarked for refurbishing Buckingham Palace.Royalists often point out that these costs represent only around £1 a year to every person in the UK.However, this does not include the security costs of looking after the family.One republican pressure group has estimated that these add up to £100m a year and help push the actual annual public cost of the monarchy closer to £350m.So the royals spend that money how they want?No, that’s the funding of their official duties – opening buildings, chairing charities, hosting garden parties, travelling the country and abroad etc.The Queen, Prince Charles and other members of the Royal Family have private incomes too from their private landed estates and financial assets.A sum of money called “The Privy Purse” goes to the Queen as revenue from a landed estate called the Duchy of Lancaster. This was £19.1m in 2016-17.Do the royals pay tax?The Queen has voluntarily paid income and capital gains tax since 1992 on her private income and the revenues not used to finance her official work.Prince Charles has also voluntarily paid income tax on his income from another landed estate, the Duchy of Cornwall, since 1993.In 2016-17 that estate yielded him revenue of £22.5m, on which he paid tax of £4.76m.But the situation is complicated.The majority of Prince Charles’ official duties are financed from the Duchy’s income. This income also covers the costs of the official duties of Camilla, William and Kate and Harry.All this expenditure offsets Charles’ tax liability. And all the “working royals” in Charles’ direct family also get some revenues from the Sovereign Grant too.Meanwhile, some of the Queen’s Privy Purse is also used to fund her official duties, which means she doesn’t pay tax on that element of her income.And what financial benefits do the royals bring?VisitBritain reckons that tourism linked to royal residences such as Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle adds up to 2.7 million visitors a year.And a consultancy called Brand Finance estimated in 2017 that the monarchy’s annual contribution to the UK economy to be around £1.8bn a year, drawing in an additional £550m of tourism revenues a year, and an increase in trade, from the Royal Family acting as ambassadors, supposedly worth £150m a year.That might sound impressive – and it’s certainly more than the higher estimates of the Royal Family’s costs to the public purse – but it’s important to put those numbers in context.Overseas visitors are estimated to have spent £22.5bn in the UK in 2016. And total UK exports summed to £543bn. Viewed from that perspective, the additional royal-related revenues start to look somewhat trivial.Moreover, we should treat even estimates of economic activity linked to the royals with a large dash of scepticism.The only way to reach these numbers is to estimate the counterfactual – what would have happened to UK tourism or trade if the Royal Family didn’t exist? Or if the official Royal Family was significantly smaller and less expensive to run?That’s not easily done. Would foreigners really be less likely to visit the UK’s historic palaces if they were no longer lived in, from time to time, by the Queen, or Prince Charles? Would the monarchy be less of a tourist draw if the likes of lesser working royals such as Princess Alexandra and the Duchess of Kent were no longer funded by the Sovereign Grant?The economic boost from visits and festivities related to royal celebrations should certainly be treated with caution given these can displace economic activity as well as create it.This seems to have happened around Prince William’s wedding in 2011, when many UK residents appear to have left the country. Royalists might make the historic argument that the monarchy brings political stability to the UK, which has a high value to the economy. But, again, this is difficult to put a price on. Especially when the appropriate counterfactual is not anarchy, but a stable republic like France or Germany.In the end, the question of whether the Royal Family is worth it, or not, is probably less a financial question than a political, moral and aesthetic one.Code of ConductInstall our AppsWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

The supermarkets announced they were in talks about a potential £15bn tie-up at the end of April, and at the time, Sainsbury’s boss Mike Coupe said the deal would not result in any job cuts or store closures. However, the transaction is facing scrutiny by the Competition and Markets Authority, which could force the combined group to sell stores in areas where competition is at risk.Mike Coupe’s Sainsbury-Asda coup could still unravelSainsbury’s boss says Asda merger won’t put pension funds at riskSainsbury’s boss caught singing ‘We’re in the money’ before interviewThe number of shops at risk is at least 6 per cent, or 73, of the companies’ combined store portfolio, according to David Haywood, founder of Maximise UK, a consultancy that identifies profitable new locations for retailers. Mr Haywood told the BBC: “There hasn’t been a retail deal like this in more than a decade. The real focus will be on how Sainsbury’s and Asda’s main supermarkets operate at a local level and how they overlap. The CMA will be concerned about whether the deal reduces the number of competing brands within a 10 or 15 minute drive time.”The estimate of 73 store closures is based on a scenario in which the CMA includes Aldi and Lidl as competitors to Sainsbury’s and Asda. However, Maximise said that if the CMA takes a more hardline stance and excludes the discounters from its calculations, Sainsbury’s and Asda could be forced to dispose of up to 245 stores. Sainsbury’s CEO sings ‘We’re in the Money’ before ITV News segment about £12 billion merger with AsdaMr Coupe has promised that any disposals the combined group has to make will be sold as trading entities, but Mr Haywood said this begs a greater question as to which company will take on the stores. “”For me this is the real issue regarding these overlapping catchment areas,” says Mr Haywood. “Considering that 66 per cent of the stores caught in the overlap analysis have selling areas over 20,000 sq ft, the key issue is who can actually acquire store locations of this size.

The series follows Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, also known as Osho, and the free-love community which built up around him in Oregon in the 1980s.It’s perhaps the archetypal image of the cult we’ve come to recognise: the followers of Rajneesh, who died in 1990, dressed in orange their leader was a charismatic Indian guru (who relocated to the US after the Indian government frowned upon his activities) the disciples gave huge amounts of cash to their figurehead, lost contact with their families.But cults don’t have to follow the pattern of Rajneeshpuram, as the Oregon ranch was renamed, or the bloodbaths at Jonestown or Waco, where David Koresh’s sect the Branch Davidians was raided by the FBI in 1993. More often than not, they are more mundane than that… but no less damaging.Rajneesh, also known as Osho, with his ‘Orange People’ followers (Netflix)Katy Morgan-Davies last month published a book about her experiences living in Brixton with the cult leader – and her father – Aravindan Balakrishnan, who was jailed on charges of rape and imprisonment in 2015. Morgan-Davies managed to flee the cult in 2013 after 30 years – her entire life.Cults are back in the news again, but for Ian Haworth they never went away. As the head of the UK-based Cult Information Centre, he spends his life collating information on cults, offering advice and help to those who have escaped – or wish to – and campaigns for stricter legislation to control the reach and influence of these malign groups.“I’ve dealt with more than 1,000 different cults,” says Haworth. “That includes the Rajneesh group. The Netflix documentary series has generated a lot of interest internationally, which can’t be a bad thing.”Katy Morgan-Davies, 33, formerly known as Rosie Davies, who was kept as a prisoner by her father Aravindan Balakrishnan (PA)That interest comes in peaks and troughs, naturally, with particular focus at the moment thanks to Wild Wild Country and Morgan-Davies’ memoir. Haworth says: “I suppose the biggest peak we’ve had began on 1 January 1999, when there was a huge amount of cult activity related to the millennium, when all kinds of things were promised or predicted. Of course, mathematically, the millennium ended at the end of the year 2000, not the end of 1999, but cult leaders don’t really care about such things. They care about money, and controlling people, and power.”Born in Lancashire, the son of a farmer, Haworth emigrated to Canada in 1972 while in his twenties. By 1978 he was working as a communications consultant for a large company, and had never given a thought to cults. Aged 31, he happened to be stopped by a woman with a clipboard in a Toronto street.After fleeing a cult in 1978, Ian Haworth has dedicated his life to helping others in the same situation (Cult Information Centre)“She was very attractive and I was very single,” remembers Haworth. “When she asked me if I had time to answer a few questions for what I thought was market research, I said yes.”But after only half a dozen questions, the tone of the exchange altered. The woman told Haworth that his answers indicated he’d fit in very well with a group she was involved with, and that it would enable him to give something back to society rather than just taking. A meeting was taking place the following week and Haworth was invited along.“I turned up and there were about a hundred people there,” he says. “A woman was talking about her addiction to alcohol and drugs, and how this group had helped her. I was planning to sneak away at the end, because I’d been brought up to be polite and didn’t want to just walk out. Then they brought out drinks and cakes, and as I’d paid $2 (£1.50) to attend I decided I might as well get my money’s worth before leaving.”The world of Cults: in picturesThe world of Cults: in picturesAravindan Balakrishnan, known as ‘Comrade Bala’ within the women-only collective he founded 40 years ago, carried out a brutal campaign of sexual degradation against the women over several decades.

Aravindan Balakrishnan was jailed for 23 years in 2016. To keep his devotees in check, Balakrishnan invented \u0027Jackie\u0027, which he said could kill or trigger earthquakes if anyone went against his will. He claimed that a challenge to his leadership resulted in the 1986 space shuttle disaster and Jackie, an invisible war machine, was responsible for the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour party leader. PAwords by Hardeep Matharu Jim Jones, founder of the Peoples Temple sect in Jonestown, north Guyana, in 1978. Believers of the Peoples Temple of the Disciples of Christ followed Reverend Jones to Guyana in the Seventies, hoping to create a utopia in the jungle. Jonestown was envisaged as a “rainbow family” of all ages and races, the preacher had promised them: “Divine principles. Total equality. A society where people own all things in common, where there is no rich or poor, where there are no races.” APwords by Adam LusherReverend Jones wanted to create a glorious sacrifice, a defiant act of “revolutionary suicide” that would echo through history. Some disciples willingly colluded, cheering as he exhorted them to kill themselves and their children. But the bodies found with bent needles in their arms testified to the fact that some refused and were forcibly injected. Rexwords by Adam LusherWhen they finally counted the bodies after what would become known as the Jonestown massacre of 18 November 1978, the total came to 918, of whom 304 were children. They had been persuaded to “drink the Kool-Aid”, Flavor Aid, used to mask the bitter taste of cyanide, mixed with a dash of Valium.APwords by Adam LusherMaude Julien, now 60, was forced to hold onto an electric fence for without showing feeling as a child. The ritual was considered to be a test of her willpower by her father, who wanted to make her “superhuman”.\u0026#13Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, also known as Osho, and the free-love community which was built up around him in Oregon in the 1980s. Rajneesh, who died in 1990, was a charismatic Indian guru (who relocated to the US after the Indian government frowned upon his activities). His disciples gave huge amounts of cash to their figurehead and lost contact with their families.During a break he went into the corridor for a cigarette, and that’s when the cult members pounced. Haworth had seen his doctor not long before and been told if he carried on smoking like he did he’d be lucky to see 40. The group told him that they would absolutely guarantee he would stop smoking if he attended a further course for $220. He’d already looked into smoking-cessation courses that were of comparable cost, so decided he’d give this one a go.“The course took place in September, 1978,” says Haworth. “By the end of the course I’d given notice at my job, promised to dedicate my life to the cult, and handed over all my savings, which amounted to about $1,500.”Jonestown commune mass suicide in 1978 (AP)Even now, Haworth cannot identify the tipping point that turned him from someone who’d turned up for a meeting at the behest of an attractive woman to someone who gave himself, body and soul, to a cult, other than mid-way through the course when he stopped smoking. “I suppose that was the moment I went over to them – they had done what they said they would do.”Cults often thrive on feeding into people’s desires. Sometimes they will promise success, artistic or creative talent, fulfil a desire in their targets to effect social change or, as with Haworth, to “give something back” to the world. They will promise freedom from addictions or improved physical or mental health. They’re what Haworth calls therapy cults, as opposed to the religious cults that offer more spiritual promises.If you’re born into a cult you don’t have that ‘Real Ian’ vs ‘Cult Ian’ internal battle that I had. You emerge from that and the first question is… who am I? It’s an incredibly difficult and delicate situationOver the next month, Haworth tried to recruit his friends and even neighbours to the group. They were appalled at the change in him, but, he says, “I thought they were wrong, I knew they weren’t part of the elite, like I was.”It was an almost textbook recruitment, and Haworth firmly believes he would have been lost to everyone who knew him but for one error on the part of the cult. “Most cults programme their members against the media very early on. These people didn’t do that,” he says. And that was what saved him.A neighbour gave him a copy of the Toronto Star which had featured a front-page exposé of the group Haworth was involved in, written by the investigative reporter Sidney Katz. Haworth read the piece and contacted Katz immediately to verify his facts. He then, as he describes it, “fell apart at the seams”. Having seen Katz’s research and evidence first hand, at the invitation of the journalist, Haworth angrily confronted the cult’s leaders, and they effectively banished him. He was finally free of them.“That was in October,” he says. “Then, in the November, everything came out about the Jonestown cult. And I knew that could have been me. It took me 11 months to fully recover and get back to myself.”NXIVM (which calls itself a ‘multi-level marketing organisation’) member Allison Mack leaving US District Court after her bail hearing in Brooklyn (Getty)It took that long for the nagging whispers of “Cult Ian”, as Haworth describes the person he was when he was with the group, to be finally silenced, and for “Real Ian” to reassert himself. And good sense would dictate that was the point he turned his back on cults forever and got on with his life.“I come from a farming background in Lancashire,” says Haworth. “People used to say, ‘If there’s summat up, then tha’ does summat about it’. So I did summat about it.”Sidney Katz put Haworth in touch with a TV producer called Peter Scott and together they set up what was first called the Council for Mind Abuse, and which later metamorphosed into the Cult Information Centre in 1987, now run as a charity.I’ve dealt with more than 1,000 different cults. That includes the Rajneesh group. The Netflix documentary series has generated a lot of interest internationally, which can’t be a bad thingHaworth and Scott concentrated on the group he had been involved with, even handing out flyers to a party of new recruits flown into Canada, exhorting them to go back to the airport. Faced with Haworth’s evidence, many of them did. Eventually, the resistance proved too much for the group. “Toronto wasn’t big enough for the both of us,” he smiles. “They got out.”Haworth doesn’t know where they are now, or if they still exist. Cults change their names often, to keep one step ahead of the media or inquisitive minds, and to muddy the paper trail they leave behind. Besides, he soon had more than enough on his plate as more and more people began to get in touch, especially after he had relocated back to the UK.One of the Cult Information Centre’s primary roles is working with ex-cult members. He likens the trauma that recovering cult followers go through to PTSD, and says systems to deal with and help them are variable, if present at all.He would also like to see stronger laws to deal with cults there’s no specific legislation surrounding them, and it’s only when cult leaders are discovered to have committed actual crimes, such as Aravindan Balakrishnan in 2015, that the law can act.Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh surrounded by devotees (Netflix)The Aravindan Balakrishnan case, and the revelations of Katy Morgan-Davies in her new book, add an extra dimension to Haworth’s work. It’s one thing to try to help cult members who have managed to break free return to their old, pre-cult lives, but what of those born into cults?“If you’re born into a cult you don’t have that ‘Real Ian’ vs ‘Cult Ian’ internal battle that I had,” says Haworth. “You emerge from that and the first question is… who am I? It’s an incredibly difficult and delicate situation.”And don’t think it is only stupid people who would fall for a cult. Experts say that cults are most likely to be attractive to intelligent, well-educated people… they have flexible minds can consider and be seduced by the alternative lifestyles offered by cults.Documentary about alleged sex cult NXIVM being producedSmallville actor allegedly tried to recruit Emma Watson to ‘sex cult’Waco: what really happened when David Koresh’s cult faced the FBI?From Jonestown in the Seventies to Rajneeshpuram in the 1980s to Brixton in the 2000s: cults endure, and spring up all across the world. Nothing about modern life and its complexities has inured us against the attractions of a charismatic guru or cult leader.“They start off wanting the usual things,” says Haworth. “Money, sex, power over people. Then, after perhaps about 10 years, they start to believe the things they say, they maybe start to believe they are gods.”And as long as the false gods continue to prey on the innocent, Ian Haworth will continue his 40-years-and-counting battle against the scourge of the cults.For more information on Haworth’s work at the Cult Information Centre go to cultinformation.org.ukor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Serendipitously, at the start of this bicentennial year, I found myself invited to a wedding in what used to be called Karl-Marx-Stadt, since renamed Chemnitz, in the former East Germany. Communism may have formally collapsed with the downfall of the Soviet Union, yet it has not been extinguished.The world’s most populous state and rising superpower, China, is officially communist, albeit nominally. And socialist ideas remain prevalent throughout the world. The resurgence of socialism could be seen in the Chavismo new left wave of Latin American politics (admittedly now in the process of being rolled back). In the US, self-proclaimed socialist senator Bernie Sanders could well have been as unlikely an occupant of the Oval office as Donald Trump – if the Democratic National Committee had not conspired against him.In the UK, unapologetic socialist Jeremy Corbyn  swept to the leadership of Her Majesty’s opposition, appointed Trotskyist John McDonnell as shadow chancellor (McDonnell recently told the Financial Times that their aims for Britain are socialist), pronounced socialism as no longer a dirty word to a delirious conference, before garnering 40 per cent of the vote in the general election. In France, Jean Luc Mélenchon performed respectably in the first round of the French elections, commanding nearly 20 per cent of the vote. In Greece, the left-wing Syriza government remains in power – even though its manifesto has been crushed by international finance capital. Its former finance minister and firebrand Yanis Varoufakis describes himself as a lapsed Marxist. His recent essay penned in  cites Marx’s analysis as both the key to understanding our present predicament and the way out of it.John McDonnell says he won\u0027t be a Marxist ChancellorIn 2015, socialism was the most searched word on Merriam Webster’s online dictionary. Socialism does not carry historical baggage for a younger generation left behind by the iniquities of capitalism. A Harvard study found that a majority of millennials reject capitalism and a third are in favour of socialism. This is what might be called the revenge of Marx the rehabilitation of one of the world’s historical philosophers. Marx inverted Hegelian doctrine into dialectical materialism, affirming that it was material relations that were responsible for consciousness and social relations  –  not the other way round. In 2011, back when it was still unfashionable to confess to being Marxist, Oxford University literary theorist Professor Terry Eagleton boldly decreed that the bearded prophet had been right after all. Eagleton is no longer alone.A slew of books herald the end of capitalism, in the words of economic sociologist Wolfgang Streeck, and announce that we are entering the epoch of Postcapitalism, according to the gospel of journalist and author Paul Mason. The most dangerous philosopher in the West, Slavoj Zizek,  according to The New Republic magazine ,  is communist one of his recent tomes, Living in the End Times, conjures up the apocalyptic sense of the death throes of capitalism.Of course, it wasn’t meant to be like this. Marx’s ideas had apparently been discredited with the collapse of communism and consigned to Trotsky’s dustbin of history. Hadn’t history proven that communism was not a historical inevitability? Then came the 2008 financial crash and the demise of political economist Francis Fukuyama’s ‘end of history’. A decade of austerity was the death knell for the ideological vacuum. The fall-out has seen a polarisation between authoritarian nationalism and progressivism between dystopia and NOT dystopia, if you like.Neoliberalism​  always presented itself as depoliticised, in that the free market is akin to an all-enveloping atmosphere and as irresistible as a force of nature. Its allocation of resources and outcomes supposedly only required mere supervision through technocratic managerialism. In reality, it could not have been more ideological, operating through the corporate capture of the state and hollowing out of the institutions of civic society. Global capitalism appeared to be indomitable and impregnable, in so far as it was the hegemonic system. Yet at the same time, the delayed reaction of a series of political earthquakes, in the form of the Arab Spring and a wave of authoritarian populism, has exposed its vulnerabilities. Even if these events have not challenged the fundamental basis of the system, its neoliberal globalisation variant is under attack.Yanis Varoufakis was at the forefront of Greece’s radical left coalition (Getty)Mao Zedong’s description of capitalism as a paper tiger seems as pertinent as ever. Marxism bequeathed a rich legacy of thinkers, ranging from Lenin and Trotsky to the Frankfurt school, as well as the likes of Antonio Gramsci, Fredric Jameson and Alain Badiou. It was once unthinkable to break with Marxist orthodoxy on the left. Until, as American Marxist Marshall Berman relates in his modern classic All that is Solid Melts into Air (taking its cue from the famous phrase in the Communist Manifesto), a group of disaffected French post-structuralists and postmodernists, namely Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida and Roland Barthes, did just that. Disillusioned by the defeat of May 1968, when an uprising against De Gaulle resulted in his party emerging even stronger than before, they broke ranks.Raoul Peck: I Am Not Your Negro director on his film about Karl MarxPub where Marx and Engels discussed communist theory shuts downKarl Marx is \u0027back in fashion,\u0027 says shadow chancellor John McDonnellIs Jeremy Corbyn, in the words of his favourite philosopher Karl Marx,\u0027We can learn a great deal from Marx\u0027, says Jeremy CorbynIn the intervening decades, the battles of identity politics have been significant but they have also been hampered by the lack of a structural, systemic understanding of how capitalism operates. Where resistance has mirrored the fragmented, atomised, hyper-inidualism of neoliberalism then it has often been doomed to failure. All of which is very much bound up with the Cold War victory of the US empire. The CIA saw its chance, according to a recently declassified research paper. The agency read French postmodern theory, concluding that its questioning of the objective basis of reality could be used to undermine the Marxist doctrine of historical and teleological inevitability. Millions of dollars were pumped into front organisations such as magazines, publishing houses and favoured academics, in order to push postmodern ideas and to create a centre left, thus demarcating the outer boundary of respectable ideas – anything beyond which could be denounced as dangerous and radical lunacy. After all, the strategy of ide and rule has generally been the preferred one of the ruling class.Karl Marx: social, political and economic theorist in picturesKarl Marx: social, political and economic theorist in picturesGerman social, political and economic theorist Karl Marx.

The statues, created by artist Ottmar Hoerl, are part of an exhibition at the Museum Simeonstift Trier that were created to commemorate the 130th anniversary of the death of Marx in 1883. Marx, who was born in Trier, is the author of The Communist Manifesto, and his ideas on the relationship between labour, industry and capital created the ideological foundation for socialist and communist movements across the globe. Marx was familiar with the methods of the ruling class. He was often on the run from European authorities, eventually finding refuge in the relative tolerance of London where he ided up his time between his smoke-filled home (Soho then later Kentish town), the British Library and watering holes. His rebellious life  –  immersed in the struggles of the 19th century, from the 1848 revolutions to the Paris commune  –  lent itself, naturally, to the counterculture of the late 20th century. And now to the glamour of the big screen. A new Marx biopic – The Young Karl Marx   from I Am Not Your Negro director Raoul Peck  –  has been released. Marx’s starting point, outlined in his 1844 letter For A Ruthless Criticism of Everything Existing to fellow philosopher Arnold Ruge, is a philosophical tabula rasa comparable to a Cartesian wiping of the slate clean. This position of ‘Kritik’, adopted by the young Hegelians, gradually evolved into praxis for Marx. Hence, in Theses on Feuerbach (1888), Marx states “the philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways the point, however, is to change it”.The Communist Manifesto itself was not merely a political and economic tract. It is a call to arms, as well as a work of canonical sublimity and literary fecundity by turns poetic, inspired and visionary. Author and journalist Francis Wheen’s biography describes the Damascene moment at which Marx anoints the word ‘proletariat’. It descends on to the page like a thunderclap across the landscape, presaging the revolutions to come of the 20th century. In the wide-ranging debate Die Judenfrage, or The Jewish Question, Marx posits that the liberal definition of freedom is limited. The motto of ‘Liberté, Egalité, Fratérnité’ of the French revolution is just that  –  a good slogan. To take one example, equality does not relate to power or wealth but merely denotes equality before the law.Marx formulates that consciousness is generated by the mode of production, in a classic inversion of the Hegelian system. He defined alienation as the quintessential state of mind and being under capitalism, corresponding to the economic relations of commodification, exploitation and oppression. It is a state of mind that is little understood by the billions who experience it daily. Thus, bourgeois society is predicated on economic inidualism, private ownership and self-interest. The relations between iniduals, including intimate relations, are thus egoistical. Pure self-interest becomes the prime driver of not just economic processes but all relations. Under capitalism, every entity, no matter how sacred, can be transformed, exploited and sold for profit. This is what Marx meant by the intrinsic process of commodification. And it is this limitless commodification which extends into every sphere, including sex, the body and relationships.Lenin (left) and Trotsky were two of the 20th century’s greatest revolutionaries inspired by Marxism (Getty)Online pornography, social media  and dating apps are merely the latest extrapolations of this relentless commodification. Furthermore, social roles and relations are engendered by historical modes of production. Thus, the agrarian, feudal world corresponds to the social strata of monarchy aristocracy and the church dominating and exploiting the peasantry. Similarly, the industrial, urbanised world corresponds to the social structure of the bourgeoisie exploiting the proletariat. In a memorably thunderous passage in The Communist Manifesto, Marx extrapolates this connection between social and economic relations to define free trade: “It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom  –  Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.”Marx outlined the history of mankind as the history of class struggle in which the classes are opposed in a dialectical paradigm. Thus, we move from antiquity with the duality of slave owner and slaves to the feudal age of lord and serf to the capitalist age of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. It is these same unsustainable contradictions that Marx later proposes will bury capitalism, when the burgeoning proletariat become the ‘gravediggers’ of the bourgeoisie. This ‘final’ stage will usher in communism, completely transforming and reconfiguring the previous relations into a classless society. Marx outlines that communism, in abolishing private property, also abolishes alienation and wage bondage, leading to worker emancipation and, by extension, universal emancipation. Nevertheless, Marx subscribes to the enlightenment belief in the rationality and logic of mankind to create a narrative of progress. The bourgeois capitalist system is perceived as a necessary step in this progression, enabling the transition from a feudal, agrarian society into an urban, industrialised one. Thus, the bourgeoisie is portrayed as having played a revolutionary role in transforming the world. In its propensity for upheaval and turmoil, capitalism never ceases to alter the world.A monument to Karl Marx in the German city Chemnitz, formerly Karl-Marx-Stadt (Getty)The dialectical materialist analysis of the history of class struggle played out in the contradictions of Marx’s own life. Whether in his marriage to the aristocratic Jenny Von Westphalen, or his friendship with industrialist Friedrich Engels, which enabled the genius of Marx and offset the penury of his journalism and political activities. Some of the most switched-on uber capitalists and masters of the universe concede that Marx’s basic analysis of capitalism has never been improved upon. Trump billionaire backer and donor Peter Thiel states that the breakdown of the status quo points either towards libertarianism or Marxism. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett  infamously once said: “There’s class warfare, all right, but it’s my class, the rich class, that’s making war, and we’re winning.”The Marxist critique of capitalism hinges on its innate tendency towards concentration and centralisation of wealth. In Capital Volume 1, Marx fleshes out the M-C-M circuit (in which M is money and C is commodities). This circuit guarantees the expansion of capital, providing the economic basis of capitalism as a mechanism for limitless capital accumulation. The resulting crises of overproduction and capital accumulation are resolved through the enforced destruction of productive forces, the conquest of new markets and more thorough exploitation paving the way for more extensive and destructive crises. Fracking might be viewed as the ultimate metaphor for this process, whilst Uber is emblematic of the same hyper-exploitation.French economist Thomas Piketty’s work, updating the original title to Capital in the Twenty-First Century, using a large amount of historical data, has further corroborated Marx’s theories on the concentration of wealth. Unsurprisingly, several decades of neoliberalism have been the greatest testament to how a deregulated capitalism, red in tooth and claw, siphons wealth to the top 1 per cent or even 0.1 per cent. Recent figures show that the wealthiest eight billionaires in the world (whom you could fit into a people carrier) have as much wealth as the bottom half of the global population, or some 3. 5 billion people. Astonishingly, the equivalent figure was the 62 wealthiest billionaires in 2016. Back in 2010 it was more than 300. This is how rapidly wealth is being sucked up to the top  – this may be termed the vacuum-up effect as opposed to the myth of trickle-down economics.Stefan Konarske, left, as Friedrich Engels and August Diehl as Karl Marx in ‘The Young Karl Marx’ (Rex)Whilst Victorian capitalism was dominated by small-to-medium-sized companies, the middle decades of the 20th century witnessed a shift to statist capitalism. In effect, the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China  represented variations on this theme. Since then the age of globalisation has been ushered in with multinational corporations straddling the globe – many of them larger than the states they operate in. The movement of vast pools of capital on a global scale is historically unmatched. Mega mergers seem to be rarely out of the headlines. In other words, the centralisation Marx predicted 150 years ago is panning out.There is a one-way trend towards the control of capital by an ever smaller number of players. Neoliberal doctrine emphasises the virtues of competition. Yet the reality of deregulated free markets, most evidently in financial services, has been monopoly, cartels, collusion and rigging. This is evidenced by the big four dominance in every sector from banking, accountancy, magic circle law firms, to high street supermarkets, energy companies and privatised utilities. The contradictions of the system have now attained a new level of absurdity.Capitalists presently invest in existing money, be it financial instruments, housing or debt, in order to make profit. In fact, this financialisation of the economy has superseded the traditional profit-making processes of manufacturing. Unlike manufacturing, this financialisation does not create value. Instead it creates asset bubbles of financial and housing speculation, which eventually burst, as happened on a seismic scale in the 2008 crash. Since the 1970s there have been a series of escalating market crises  – yet even this volatility is profitable for hedge funds.Civil unrest in France in 1968 was described as a social revolution against capitialism (Getty)So if late capitalism is economically, socially and ecologically unsustainable, not to mention bankrupt, then whither to from here? One of the obtuse criticisms of Marx has been the lack of a blueprint, despite the fact that a participatory, truly democratic society would need to emerge organically rather than following a roadmap. Marx posited revolution as “the driving force of history”. The overthrow of the existing state and the dissolution of property would lead to liberation extending to the dissolution of the bourgeois conceptions of family, marriage and all nation states. This liberation from national barriers would then bring everyone into connection with the production of the whole world for the pleasure of their consumption.Under communism, Marx daintily describes how one would be able to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening and criticise after dinner (naturally). Communism would appear to truly represent the end of the history, or at least the end of history, as class struggle :  “Communism is the riddle of history solved and it knows itself to be this solution.” Marx formulates that human emancipation can only be achieved by going beyond the bourgeois framework material emancipation translates into spiritual and sensuous emancipation. Only the resolution of the material modes of production, beyond the paradigm of economic inidualism, private property and self-interest, can liberate consciousness and revolutionise social relations  –  such that there is the capacity, the capability and propensity for free behaviour and genuine ties between iniduals based on love, warmth and affection, rather than purely calculating and cold self-interest.The exultant victory lap of all-singing, all-dancing capitalism has been remarkably brief the unipolar moment of American triumphalism short-lived. Only recently, US defence secretary Jim Mattis  announced that the era of great power politics has returned. Undoubtedly, a set of progressive ideas is coalescing amongst the new left  –  a green economy, public and democratic control of the economy, full automation. This 21st century manifesto is embodied in such books as Inventing the Future. The critical question remains of the vehicle necessary to bring about this transition.There is no doubt that 21st-century global capitalism is far more sophisticated and resilient than that of pre-revolutionary Tsarist Russia. The transition of capitalism to an alternative political and economic system will likely play out over a protracted period, even if it is catalysed by revolution. Much in the same way that feudalism evolved into capitalism through the dual industrial (economic) and French revolutions (political), in which the bourgeoisie superseded the aristocratic order preceded by the 17th-century English civil war.Or to leave the last word to Marx: “No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old society.”Youssef El-Gingihy is the author of ‘How to Dismantle the NHS in 10 Easy Steps’, published by Zero booksor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that. Nonetheless in Wordsworth’s words, “to be young was very heaven”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The supermarkets announced they were in talks about a potential £15bn tie-up at the end of April, and at the time, Sainsbury’s boss Mike Coupe said the deal would not result in any job cuts or store closures.

Mr Haywood told the BBC: “There hasn’t been a retail deal like this in more than a decade. The real focus will be on how Sainsbury’s and Asda’s main supermarkets operate at a local level and how they overlap. The CMA will be concerned about whether the deal reduces the number of competing brands within a 10 or 15 minute drive time.”The estimate of 73 store closures is based on a scenario in which the CMA includes Aldi and Lidl as competitors to Sainsbury’s and Asda. However, Maximise said that if the CMA takes a more hardline stance and excludes the discounters from its calculations, Sainsbury’s and Asda could be forced to dispose of up to 245 stores. Sainsbury’s CEO sings ‘We’re in the Money’ before ITV News segment about £12 billion merger with AsdaMr Coupe has promised that any disposals the combined group has to make will be sold as trading entities, but Mr Haywood said this begs a greater question as to which company will take on the stores. “”For me this is the real issue regarding these overlapping catchment areas,” says Mr Haywood. “Considering that 66 per cent of the stores caught in the overlap analysis have selling areas over 20,000 sq ft, the key issue is who can actually acquire store locations of this size.

The rate is significantly higher than on many unsecured personal loans available from high street banks.“As RPI has been de-designated as a national statistic, the committee has urged the government to abandon its use to calculate student loan interest rates in favour of CPI,” Ms Morgan said.“In its response to the committee’s report, the Department for Education acknowledged the flaws of RPI, but argued that continuing its use has provided consistency over time.UK Government to repackage student loans Budget 2017: Graduates to stop overpaying student loans Half of millennials would give up right to vote to clear student loansHow to use a student loan to build a £4m travel business “Continuing to use a measure that it readily admits is flawed, on the grounds of consistency, is absurd it guarantees that student loan interest rates will be consistently flawed.”The comments came as the Treasury Committee published the government’s response to its highly critical report on the current student loans system.The government said: “RPI has always been used for calculating interest on student loans, providing consistency over time.”It added: “The flaws in the RPI measure of inflation are well understood, and the Office for National Statistics have delivered a substantial programme of work to improve the way they measure inflation over the last two years.“The review of post-18 education and funding will look at how students and graduates contribute to the cost of their studies, including the level, terms and duration of their contribution.“It is now for the independent panel to consider the issues raised within the terms of reference in their report to government. The government cannot prejudge the findings of the panel or outcomes of the review.”A study last year by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that three-quarters of students will never clear their loans and that graduates from low-income families finish their studies with the highest debt of more than £57,000 on average.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Today we are calling on the government to guarantee that these three new ships for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary will be built in domestic shipyards.”“Our shipyards used to produce half of all new ships worldwide. Our current market share is now less than half a per cent. The Tories seem hell-bent on accelerating and deepening this industrial decline,” Mr Corbyn will add.His call follows the GMB union’s demand for the government to use the order to “buy for Britain” and estimated £285m could be returned to taxpayers through income tax and national insurance contributions if the auxiliary vessels were built in the UK.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesDominick Chilcott, right, British ambassador in Turkey, hands over a letter of apology from the UK government to Libyan dissident Abdel Hakim Belhaj,  at the British Consulate, in Istanbul.

But Scottish employers have pushed through one set of redundancies after another in recent years.“Our proposal would both sustain existing shipbuilding and supply chain jobs, and create new ones – right here in Scotland and also across the UK.”But an MOD spokesman said Britain was witnessing a “renaissance in national shipbuilding”, saying all its warships are built in the UK, with the Clyde securing 4,000 jobs until 2035, having been given a commitment it will build the Navy’s eight planned Type 26 Frigates.“We are launching a competition for three new fleet solid support ships this year and strongly encourage British yards to take part,” they added.“Since 2010 this government has invested more than £6bn in shipbuilding in the UK, securing thousands of jobs.

Don’t stop on the side of the road,” Doug Bos, the owner of the zoo, told CBC News in January, when the footage was shared. “If everybody would listen to the video, that’s what the message was – don’t do this.”Where not to visit if you love animalsWhere not to visit if you love animalsChimpanzees are forced to perform demeaning tricks on leashes and are often subject to cruel training techniques. Animals who are confined to small, barren enclosures and forced to perform unsurprisingly show symptoms of stress and depression. Chimpanzees have been documented rocking back and forth, sucking their lips, salivating and swaying against enclosure perimeters in distress.Some marine parks use bottlenose dolphins in performances and offer visitors the opportunity to swim with dolphins. Unfortunately, people are often unaware that these animals are captured in the wild and torn from their families or traded between different parks around the world.Tigers are forced to live in an unnatural and barren environment and have to endure interactions with a constant stream of tourists. Since tigers never lose their wild instincts, across the world they are reportedly drugged, mutilated and restrained in order to make them “safe” for the public. However, every year, incidents of tiger maulings are reported at this type of tourist attraction.Sunning on the beach is great for humans – we can take a quick dip or catch a bite to eat when we get too hot or hungry. But it\u0027s pure hell for donkeys who are confined to the beach and forced to cart children around on the hot sand. Some donkey-ride operators at beach resorts in the UK even keep the animals chained together at all times. Some parks confine orcas to concrete tanks and force them to perform meaningless tricks for food - many die in captivity. Orcas are highly intelligent and social mammals who may suffer immensely, both physically and mentally, when they\u0027re held in captivity.Lions are confined to fenced areas so that they can easily be cornered, with no chance of escape. Most of them will have been bred in captivity and then taken from their mothers to be hand-reared by the cub-petting industry. When they get too big, they may be drugged before they are released into a hunting enclosure. Because these animals are usually kept in fenced enclosures (ranging in size from just a few square yards to thousands of acres), they never stand a chance of surviving.Every year, tourists travel to Pamplona for the Running of the Bulls. The bulls who are forced to slip and slide down the town\u0027s narrow cobblestone streets are chased straight into the bullring. They are then taunted, stabbed repeatedly and finally killed by the matador in front of a jeering crowd. The majority of Spaniards reject bullfighting, but tourists are keeping the cruel industry on its last legs. City streets are no place for horses. The animals toil in all weather extremes, suffering from respiratory distress from breathing in exhaust fumes as well as numerous hoof, leg and back problems from walking on pavement all day long. As easily spooked prey animals, horses subjected to the loud noises and unexpected sounds of city streets are likely to be involved in accidents, even deadly ones. The zoo community regards the animals it keeps as commodities, and animals are regularly bought, sold, borrowed and traded without any regard for established relationships. Zoos breed animals because the presence of babies draws visitors and boosts revenue, yet often, there\u0027s nowhere to put the offspring as they grow, and they are killed, as we recently saw with Marius the giraffe in Denmark. Some zoos have introduced evening events with loud music and alcohol which disrupt the incarcerated animals even further. At the time, a trainer said there were no safety concerns, as the bear was secured by a chain and the film had been taken before the Dairy Queen had opened for the day. Football team condemned after muzzled bear forced to deliver ballMan ‘trying to take selfie’ with bear is mauled to deathFirst polar bear bred in Singapore dies after five-year health battlePark staff accidentally kill one of world’s rarest bearsFemale bears evolve to hunting threat by raising cubs for longerThe zoo, located in Innisfail, Alberta, has now been charged under the Wildlife Act for taking the bear out without informing the authorities – one count relates to the ice cream excursion and the other for failing to inform officials the bear was being taken home nightly for bottle-feeding in 2017.The owners of the wildlife park, Mr Bos and Debbie Rowland, have said they plan to plead guilty. “We made a mistake. I’m embarrassed about it,” Mr Bos told . “Every time we take an animal off the property, we’re supposed to notify Fish and Wildlife, send them an email, and we forgot to do that in both instances.”The zoo’s permit has also been revised to include new conditions requiring the zoo to provide more details when transporting animals and to keep them in a cage, crate or kennel while in a vehicle.Members of the public will also be barred from having any contact with animals, including bears. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They’ll mark it up as a victory, but this isn’t a political game.It would be an insult to democracy and hold our economy back.We must start work on building a truly Global Britain — now.THAT brickies and nurses are now having to scrimp and save for six-figure deposits is nothing short of a national scandal.No recent Government has been willing to grasp this particular nettle.Our housing crisis has been brewing for decades and sorting it will require real radicalism from the new Communities supremo James Brokenshire.He must fight the Nimbys head-on and demand Treasury cash to unleash a building programme.He must also tear up planning laws and look again at the Green Belt. The Tory leadership will be worried about their voters in the shires. But that’s nothing compared to the hit they’ll take for generations if they don’t face up to the challenge.MOTORISTS have been treated like cash cows for far too long.Plans for new “toxic taxes” rub salt in the wound, especially for diesel drivers.It wasn’t that long ago punters were told it was greener to buy diesels, so fining them years later in the name of environmentalism is especially unfair.It must be possible to “go green” without piling misery on hard-working Brits who rely on their motor to get to work, take the kids to school and visit the GP.Time for a u-turn on yet another fuel tax.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They can begin by repealing Section 40, as their manifesto pledged.THE Lords’ latest sickening insult to democracy has surely hammered the final nail in the unelected chamber’s coffin.Their vote to stay in the single market is beyond belief in its stupidity, arrogance and insane ­willingness to expose the country to dangerous instability.It would mean surrendering control over immigration for ever — and never actually “leaving” the EU.The Lords’ role is to tweak and advise on laws, not impose entirely contrary policies because they don’t like how the country votes. They are telling 17.4million people: “You don’t count. We do.”How do they imagine Leavers would react if the biggest vote in our history was negated by unelected, ermine-clad party stooges, some on EU pensions?We genuinely fear the consequences.It was the Lords, too, who began the attempt to muzzle the Press. They are rotting our democracy from within.IT is appalling that the Government is ­considering a new witch-hunt into Army veterans of the Troubles.The vast majority of unsolved murders were by terrorists, mostly since given immunity by the Labour Government.Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley has been advised she cannot legally exclude veterans.

The world\u0026#8217s worst Ebola outbreak took the lives of 11,000 people in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia in 2014 after the virus spread from a young boy living in a village in rural Guinea. Poorly equipped and understaffed medical workers turned down infected patients and when the disease spread to the densely populated Liberian capital of Monrovia a health crisis turned into a catastrophe.In early 2016, the WHO said the outbreak had been contained and eliminated but 17,000 survivors were left traumatised and fearful of the future.Over the past few days, the DRC\u0026#8217s near-neighbours like Nigeria have taken steps to prevent the spread of the virus by introducing checks and health screening at its airports.Meanwhile, the Trump administration signalled its disinterest when it asked for ebola-related funding cuts of US$252 million, as part of a package aimed at reigning in government spending."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-israel-iran-golan-heights_4305596.jpg?20180510120659 ","title":"iran and israel a new conflict in the making","story":"We have now seen the two foes trade blows.Israel says its forces in the occupied Golan Heights were targeted by Iranian rocket fire.More than 20 Fajr 5 and Grad rockets were launched - four of them were intercepted by Israel\u0027s Iron Dome defence system and the rest fell short, crashing into Syrian soil.

Simone Grainger and husband Steven discussed his drug use in a series of texts and WhatsApp messages to each other that were read out in court. Simone would leave the written messages as well as record voice messages, in which children can be heard playing in the background, to her husband including that marrying him was the worst mistake of her life. The messages centred around his drug use leading up to when her body was found in the first home they shared. Grainger, 32, is accused of hitting her over the head with a saucepan before strangling her and rolling her in blankets and leaving her in the conservatory of the house. Simone\u0027s cousin found her body when she visited the house because she was concerned she had not heard from her.  Grainger denies murdering his wife on November 4 last year and sat the dock at Reading Crown Court listening intently as 1,500 messages were read through by barristers. The court previously heard Simone had told a friend before her death how her sex life was a bit like something from an episode of Doctor Foster, the hit ITV psychological drama.  Francis Fitzgibbon QC, prosecuting, said Simone had confided in two friends that she and Grainger had sex two days before her death.  He said: She said it was a bit like something from an episode of Doctor Foster. Despite Mrs Grainger\u0027s anger and frustration they maintained a degree of intimacy. Mr Fitzgibbon also outlined messages Grainger sent after he is accused of killing the mother of his two children, in which it was said he contacted a prostitute for sex.  A mixture of WhatsApp, text and iMessage\u0027s from early in 2017 to the morning of the death were read to the jury by the prosecution about Grainger\u0027s drug habits. Simone sent one message to Grainger saying: I don\u0027t wanna be with someone who makes me miserable. The next month, Simone again messaged the defendant with: You constantly defend yourself, you are weird at night and can\u0027t sleep. You\u0027re always making mistakes. Grainger replied: I\u0027m sick of going on like this, everyday you make me out to be a c**t. In June, Simone messaged her husband and said: You\u0027re a druggy and a liar, to which Grainger replied: I\u0027ll spend the rest of my married life making it up to you.  Simone later responded by saying I wish I hadn\u0027t married you. Then in a spate of late night messages in July, Simone said I seriously can\u0027t stand you, druggy is your middle name, coke head c**t, s**t dad, you\u0027re lucky the kids have got my dad, coke heads ain\u0027t family men, and p**s off and die. The next day as the arguing continued, Simone sent in a message: The coke stopped your brain, you made me want to stab you.  Grainger replied: I\u0027ve been a p***k and will make it up to you, I\u0027ll never leave without you knowing again. Simone responded: You\u0027re constantly doing it, druggy c**t. Call me a d**k again and I\u0027ll stab you, you\u0027re selfish c**k.  Into September, two months before the death of Simone, messages were sent both ways. Simone said: Go to work you sad p***k, go and live on your mum\u0027s sofa where you\u0027re destined to end up. FYI you\u0027re an a***hole, a druggy and a drunk. Grainger said: You think it\u0027s normal, that you want to stab me? In another series of messages, the mum of two said: We are over, stop taking me for a p***k. You\u0027re a f*****g b*****d and I hope you get what\u0027s coming for you, die. The jury then heard the messages between the couple after Grainger failed to turn up to the family Centre Parcs holiday after he had bought five bags of cocaine for the trip but had gone on a binge the night before. Grainger sent to a friend: I had five bags to take to Centre Parcs and ended up like Henry Hoover.

Glamourous three-year-old Afghan Hound AJ Nirvana Battle turns heads wherever he goes and has flowing locks that a model would be proud of. His owner Kevin Chan spends six to eight hours bathing his beloved pet, then piles on a number of products, including baby powder and hairspray. Marketing director Kevin, who lives in Beijing, China, has spent \u0026pound11,600 to date on grooming equipment and coughs up \u0026pound525 a month on bathing products to keep his pup\u0027s pristine floor-length mane perfectly preened.  The Hong Kong-born 29-year-old spends six to eight hours a week brushing the hairy hound and claims Battle is the most beautiful animal on the globe. Kevin said: Since the moment I decided to take Battle home, he was already the most beautiful dog in the world. He is a family member now, so I don\u0027t mind spending time and money on him. I need to bathe him regularly every seven to 10 days - it takes six to eight hours to bathe and groom him every time.  I do all the grooming myself and have spent about 100,000 CNY (\u0026pound11,600) to date on grooming equipment. I spend another 4,000 to 5,000 CNY (\u0026pound535) on the best bathing products every month. Afghan hounds were born as models and have their own unique characters. I don\u0027t style him deliberately, I just follow my heart.  I always tell people I didn\u0027t choose the dog but was chosen by him, therefore I have to try my best to give him the best treatment I can. Every day, Kevin, who adopted Battle two years and eight months ago, sprays a nutritious solution on the pooch\u0027s fur to smooth it before letting this sink in for one minute. Then he uses a bristle brush to ease out any knots in the pooch\u0027s mane - using talcum or baby powder to remove tangles. The 29-year-old has even bought a camera and taken up photography lessons so he can share the best photos of his pampered pet on social media.  Kevin said: Every day, I spray a special nutritious solution on Battle\u0027s fur and comb him. I have to brush him every day, to keep his fur from knotting together. When he was younger it would take me two hours a day to groom him, but now I only have to do this for an hour a time. The only thing, which is the hardest, is to skilfully comb him - then you can get the nicest shots. I began to film and shoot him from the first day I got him because I wanted to keep every single moment.

Doria Ragland is believed to have landed in London on Thursday, according to Good Morning America.  Meghan\u0027s mum and Dad, Thomas Markle, are to meet the Queen in the days before the wedding. They will spend time with Her Majesty, as well as Prince Philip, Prince Charles and wife Camilla, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. It will also be the first time Mr Markle meets his future son-in-law, Harry.  Royal contributor Omid Scobie told GMA: Doria will be meeting Harry and Meghan\u0027s nearest and dearest while she\u0027s here, including close friend Jessica Mulroney, who arrives on Monday. It\u0027s no doubt a stressful and very busy time for Meghan so having her mother by her side, especially on Mother\u0027s Day, will no doubt alleviate some of those nerves.  Doria arrived in the UK as Meghan\u0027s dad Thomas began his journey to London, where he will give his daughter away. The former lighting director, who lives a humble life compared to his daughter\u0027s extravagant soon-to-be-royal existence, was pictured climbing into his silver Volvo en route to the airport.  The reclusive 73-year-old set off last night from his home in Rosarito, Mexico and crossed the US border into California. There he checked into a $70-a-night motel in San Diego and reportedly picked up supplies including Gas-X anti-bloating pills and Heineken beers.  Kensington Palace announced last week Mr Markle would give his daughter away at the May 19 Windsor Castle wedding, ending months of speculation.    He had earlier told the Mirror he\u0027d love to give Meghan , 36, away on the big day at St George\u0027s Chapel, adding: I’m very pleased. I’m delighted.   A royal spokesman said: “Prince Harry and Ms Markle are very much looking forward to welcoming Ms Markle\u0027s parents to Windsor for the wedding. Mr Thomas Markle and Ms Doria Ragland will be arriving in the UK in the week of the wedding, allowing time for Prince Harry\u0027s family, including The Queen, The Duke of Edinburgh, The Prince of Wales, The Duchess of Cornwall, and The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, to spend time with them before the big day. Both of the bride\u0027s parents will have important roles in the wedding. On the morning of the wedding, Ms Ragland will travel with Ms Markle by car to Windsor Castle. Mr Markle will walk his daughter down the aisle of St George\u0027s Chapel. Ms. Markle is delighted to have her parents by her side on this important and happy occasion.”    It was also announced last week that the royal wedding would “celebrate the memory” of Harry\u0027s mum, Princess Diana, with her three siblings invited and her sister Lady Jayne Fellows giving the reading.  He said: “In addition to having the support of The Queen, his father The Prince of Wales, and his brother Prince William as Best Man, Prince Harry is also keen to involve his mother\u0027s family in his wedding. “All three siblings of Diana, Princess of Wales will be in attendance and Lady Jane Fellowes will give the reading. “Prince Harry and Ms. Markle both feel honoured that Lady Jane will be representing her family and helping to celebrate the memory of the late Princess on the wedding day.” The Duchess of Cambridge, who gave birth to her third child less than two weeks ago, will attend the service.  However, little Prince Louis will not go, it was announced. Unusually, Meghan will not have a maid of honour and will instead only have children as bridesmaids on the day. Their names will be announced a few days before the wedding. The bride will stay outside Windsor Castle the night before the wedding, with the accommodation yet to be announced.

That\u0027s the situation every lucky person with an invitation to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s wedding is currently in. But whatever they pick for the big day, there is one very strict fashion rule every female guest MUST follow.  It\u0027s protocol for all women to wear hats to royal weddings. This rule applies to everyone from the Queen and Kate Middleton to members of the public who were invited to the big day. There have been some great examples of royal wedding hates over the years (we\u0027re looking at you Princess Beatrice...) but we expect Kate will come up with a classic.  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will tie the knot at St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle on May 19. It\u0027s where Prince Harry was christened and Prince Charles and Camilla had their blessing. After they\u0027ve said the vows the couple will take a carriage ride around the city to wave to well-wishers who are expected to line the streets. They will then head back to the castle for sit down reception and Prince Charles is organising a bit party in the evening.  There\u0027s a lot of talk about who will design Meghan\u0027s dress, but rumours are also flying about Kate\u0027s big outfit for the big day. But we know one thing for sure, it will involve a hat. Luckily for Kate, she looks great in a hat!

Unable to expand the relatively small number of grammars in England due to public opposition and a lost Parliamentary majority, Theresa May slipping the existing schools an extra \u0026pound50million is as sneaky as it is unfair. Excellent comprehensives under enormous financial strain deserve a cash boost too, as well as struggling schools which require a fresh start under a hew head. Today’s broadside from leaders of the giant National Education Union will be echoed at school gates and in staff rooms. Pupils, parents and teachers all know that squeezed funding is hurting bright kids. Schools in Wales and Scotland also receive a share of an education budget which isn’t large enough when student numbers are up. Distributing it fairly shouldn’t be hard but this Government doesn’t play fair. Pet Tory projects, are costing us what we can’t afford.

The same single tube of Colgate is 898% cheaper in Tesco, costing just 80p, and it\u0027s also on sale in Boots for \u0026pound1. Critics have accused the company of cashing in on the sick by hiking up prices at the shop in Pinderfields General Hospital in Wakefield. However bosses have said it was a printing error and it should actually only cost \u0026pound2.49 - which is still a lot more expensive than it costs elsewhere. In total 89 tubes were sold at the incorrect price before staff noticed the error. Marc Leaf, 45, noticed the shocking price tag while trying to buy toothpaste for his girlfriend who is being treated at the hospital.  He said: Everything in there is totally ridiculous. A hospital is a place where people to to get better. They aren\u0027t at their best and are usually at their most vulnerable. It\u0027s the last place they should be taken advantage of, but this price tag is just totally taking the mick out of people. It\u0027s \u0026pound7.99 for a tube of toothpaste that I\u0027ve seen for a \u0026pound1 in a Home Bargains store or a pound shop. It comes despite the company promising to slash prices in hospital shops in 2015 after MPs called them out on the different price tags compared to its own high street shops. Marc said: When I was there, I looked around, and there are a lot of people knocking about who are less fortunate than others.  It\u0027s absolutely outrageous. I went to the counter and asked the assistant \u0027is this right?\u0027 and they said it was. I was gobsmacked. It\u0027s extortion. They are cashing in on sick people who can\u0027t go elsewhere. Something needs to be done about it. In the end I went for the tiny little travel size one and it was \u0026pound2.69. That\u0027s still ridiculous. WH Smith has 610 shops on the high street and 839 \u0027travel outlets\u0027 - shops in airports, railway stations, motorway service areas, hospitals and workplaces. Of these, 129 are in hospitals. A spokesman for WH Smith said: We would like to apologise to our customers for a recent pricing error in our system relating to this product. While the wrong price was effective we sold a total of 89 units. The total proceeds from these sales (\u0026pound711) will be donated to charity. The error has been rectified and changed to the correct price of \u0026pound2.49. The company said all of the products they sell in their hospital stores are the same price as in their the high street branches. The price at the hospital in Wakefield was highlighted on Twitter by a reporter at the Health Service Journal. Responding to the tweet, one person said: They\u0027ve been warned just a couple years ago for price gouging. If that isn\u0027t an accidental mistake then they need fined.  Another added: Please tell me this isn\u0027t true. Absolutely horrible to think the cost of a product vital to oral health is spiked because someone is unwell in a hospital. This should be provided on wards regardless. One wrote: I assume that buys you a check up and polish too for that money.

Two families merging seamlessly only happens in movies – boring ones at that. But despite any differences there’s always some common ground, right? Well, here’s the exception to the rule. In the red corner, Thomas Markle, aka just some bloke. In the blue, oh just His Royal Highness Prince Charles Philip Arthur George, Prince of Wales, KG, KT, GCB, OM, AK, QSO, CC, PC, ADC, Earl of Chester, Duke of Cornwall, Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles, and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland.  Best of luck, Harry and Meghan. You are definitely going to need it.  A spot of DIY Maybe they’re not so different after all – Thomas popped to a DIY store in Rosarito, Mexico, to pick up a new toilet.  (Note to Thomas: “Hey, we all use them – am I right, Your Majesty?!”, is probably not the best conversation starter). Meanwhile, Charles showed that he wasn’t afraid to get his hands dirty with essential maintenance work either.  He delicately turned his paintbrush to some perfumed, duck-shaped soap on a visit to the Parfumerie Fragonard laboratory in Eze, south eastern France. Toilet Duck, anyone? So, Thomas was busy with a lavatory while Charles was at a laboratory... so near, yet still pretty far. Family ties In these modern times, the best way to get to know someone is to Google them. So Thomas headed to an internet caf\u0026eacute – so 90s! – to do a bit of family research.  Hopefully, he studied the photo of Harry long and hard, so when he is walking his daughter down the aisle on May 19, he knows who to aim for. Meanwhile, Charles went to Greece, the birthplace of his father, Prince Philip.  At Piraeus harbour in Athens he visited HMC Valiant. But if he’d known internet cafes still existed, he probably would have just googled it instead. What\u0027s your poison The one thing that brings most people together is having a drink.  And there are positive signs that here, finally, is a genuine shared interest between Thomas and Charles. Kind of. Earlier this month, after dropping off several bags of washing at a launderette, Thomas went to a convenience store.  He picked up some cans of Heineken and a couple of packets of fags. Meanwhile, Prince Charles drank a drop of du vin rouge on a visit to Les Halles de Lyon – Paul Bocuse food market in Lyon, France. Quelle difference, eh? A nice meal out Is Thomas allowed a plus-one for the wedding? If so, maybe his fellow diner here will be the lucky lady...  Although, how could a lady get luckier than going to Peter Piper Pizza, complete with arcade games?  There were probably fewer arcade games where Charles got his grub on earlier this week – an official dinner at the Presidential Mansion with the President Of Greece – although not definitely. Suited and booted All that internet research seems to have paid off, because Thomas seems to understand he’s going to have to make some effort to scrub up before he meets his daughter’s intended’s folks.  Hard not to wish that he’s being measured for a wedding suit here – that red and white stripey material behind you looks like a winner to us, Thomas!  Meanwhile, Charles proves with this outfit (above) that he’s a dab hand at accessorising, and not afraid of a brooch or two.

Dashcam footage shows William Farmer, 18, walking down the middle of a road being closely followed by a policeman on foot and an officer driving a white 4x4. Suddenly the unnamed officer driving swerves in front of him and bashes him to the ground with a violent thud. The teen appears to initially try to cower away from the two officers, but then suddenly rolls onto his back and starts convulsing. But instead of giving him first aid, the officer that knocked him down grabs his top and yanks him onto his front and puts him in handcuffs. His family say he was suffering from a fit when he was handcuffed by police, and are calling for an urgent inquiry into what happened.  They also raised concerns about the police force\u0027s initial response to a previous video released of the incident - which didn\u0027t show as clearly what happened. Earlier this week, police claimed the incident occurred when the teenager “collided” with the police car. They have now taken action against the unnamed officer who was driving after the latest video was released. Solicitor George Newhouse, who is providing legal support for the man\u0027s family, told NITV News : “What I find particularly concerning about that image, is that as William is having a fit, instead of showing compassion and providing assistance, it appears that he\u0027s handcuffed. And that seems totally inappropriate and in fact cruel.  He’s never fitted before and the family are incredibly distressed and concerned about his situation, his physical injuries and they’re currently investigating those and we don’t know the results as yet, Mr Newhouse said. He was an Aboriginal man simply walking down the street and being followed by a police officer. There was no need to apprehend him in this violent way, and we’re totally at a loss to understand how or why this incident took place and if it wasn’t on film I’m not so sure that you’d be seeing the intense investigation that’s currently underway. Mr Newhouse said the teenager has been going back and forth between hospital and home for tests since the incident.  Western Australia police said the matter was being investigated internally by police. A spokesman said: The officer, a senior sergeant, was stood down from all operational duty pending the outcome of the investigation by the Internal Affairs Unit. Gerry Georgatos from the federal government\u0027s National Indigenous Critical Response Service said he believed the collision was deliberate. The individual was purposely knocked over by the police vehicle., he said. Then he appears in a fit like state and instead he is maltreated further, flipped around while in a fit like state and handcuffed.

Dramatic video captured from the vehicle behind the family, believed to be from France, shows the big cats dashing towards the family at Beekse Bergen in the Netherlands. Seconds before the near horrifying encounter, a woman and whom appears to be a teenage boy were filmed leaving their black-coloured car to photograph cheetahs lying down in the park. A young child is also spotted outside the car just yards from the animals, while the woman appears to move a car seat from the back seat to the boot.  They eventually get their car and drive a short distance before getting out again when the big cats make their move. Visitors filming the cheetahs as they rampaged towards the family are heard uttering jesus and oh my god in disbelief as the family face being surrounded.  The boy is seen rushing back to the car before getting inside while a woman holding a small child in her arms cautiously walks back towards the vehicle. Amazingly, the family managed to safely return inside the car without incident.  Park rules state visitors must remain in their cars at all times. Dutch media reported that the family-of-five, consisting of two men, two women and a child, may have missed the instruction because signs are in Dutch.

Only one resident opened their door – and immediately closed it after being shown press identification.Another man swore and said “mind your own business” through a crack in his window when asked why he had parked on the site.City council officers are monitoring the situation but are yet to confirm whether they will visit.The Kingsway West Retail Park is owned by fund manager ARES, and managed by the commercial property firm GVA.Dundee City Council offers travellers a dedicated campsite on the outskirts of the city at Balmuir Wood, near Tealing.The site is six miles outside Dundee and has 20 pitches, each with its own utility unit with bathroom and shower and dedicated electricity supply.However, in the past, travellers have chosen to ignore this site and set up in areas closer to the city centre.Under current legislation, travellers can usually park on unauthorised council-owned land without issue, but may be visited by council officers to discuss their intentions.However, private landowners, such as the owners of the Kingsway West Retail Park, can call in the council or seek a court order to have travellers evicted. As a last resort, the police can also be called in.A police spokesman said: “Police Scotland can confirm it is aware of the situation and we will continue to monitor and liaise with Dundee City Council.”Dundee City Council said: “We are monitoring the situation.”The Dundee branch of Toys ‘R’ Us closed on April 24 after the company went into administration.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5af41291b89f5-848x564.jpg ","title":"parklives free outdoor activities on offer across dundee to get you fit","story":"\t\t\t\t\tParks and green spaces across Dundee are playing host to hundreds of fun, free activity sessions as ParkLives returns to the city for a third year.Thousands of Dundonians can take advantage of the growing outdoor and urban fitness craze which is sweeping the nation.Delivered by teams from Leisure and Culture Dundee and the city council, in partnership with Coca-Cola Great Britain, ParkLives sessions help local parks come to life with activities that bring communities together and improve wellbeing.Consultation with local communities has led to new activities being introduced including boxing sessions at the bandstand in Magdalen Green.for more information, click here.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ross county wide man michael gardyne on dundee and uniteds radar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWIth survival assured on Tuesday night, Dundee boss Neil McCann’s “recruitment drive” for next season is up and running.And one possible arrival could be Ross County playmaker Michael Gardyne – though, the Dark Blues may well have competition from across the city on their hands.The Dundonian is out of contract at the end of this season and, with his roots down here, a move back might be on the cards.His history with Dundee United – where he played 37 times in season 2012/13 – however, makes Tannadice a more likely destination for the 32-year-old.That’s likely to be dependent on whether Csaba Laszlo’s men can win promotion to the top flight via the play-offs.The Dark Blues won’t comment on any possible signings but gaffer Neil has been able to get working on improving his squad for next season after the 1-0 win at Ross County saw them guaranteed a ninth-place finish.He said: “The plans we’ve been looking at over the past five or six months in terms of recruitment we can actually start to push forward with now and start a bit of a recruitment drive.“I don’t think you can ever push on it 100% until you know you’re going to be safe.“Tuesday’s win allows us to start forward thinking but there’s still business to be done.“I’m not going to disrespect Ross County by going into Saturday (against Partick) and taking the foot off the gas and go through the motions, because we have to be professional.”Partick sit two points ahead of the Staggies in 11th spot and still with the possibility of catching Hamilton and jumping to safety. That’ll take a swing of 13 goals, however.With Thistle at risk of automatic relegation if they are beaten by the Dark Blues on Saturday, Neil knows his side will have to be on their game if they are to finish the season off on a high at Dens Park.He added: “We have to look to win it and, if we do our business right, we can hold our heads high.“We want to win at home. We’ve got back-to-back wins in the split and we’re looking for three.“I charged the boys with the task of getting five wins from five games – we’ve had three out of four and we’ll look to go into Partick and make it four out of five.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scheme hopes to tackle local cowboy traders","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA business partnership set up to protect local residents from unscrupulous traders has been relaunched.The Perth and Kinross Better Business Partnership (BBP) was set up in 2003 in response to a rise in instances of people by targeted by cowboy traders.The scheme’s relaunch introduces an updated code of practice and a BBP charter, which sets out how members should behave.Additionally, in order to maintain the integrity of the members list, an annual membership fee has been introduced, meaning consumers will be able to identify a member by a BBP sticker bearing the current year.Perth and Kinross Council’s housing and communities convener Councillor Peter Barrett was joined at the relaunch by trading standards officers and BBP member Instant Image, which produces signs and vehicle graphics.He said: “We are all aware of the impact that rogue traders and unscrupulous companies can have on consumers.“The BBP sets out a wide-ranging list of businesses that pledge to trade fairly and honestly, providing valuable reassurance for the public that they can be confident they will receive a high standard of service.“After 15 years of operation, and now well over 250 members, it is appropriate that the scheme is reviewed and refreshed for the future. I hope more local companies will consider joining the BBP.”The scheme aims to create a list of local traders who have pledged to operate in an open manner to give consumers confidence.The local authority joined Police Scotland to establish the partnership, and all members are vetted by the force and the council’s trading standards team.The BBP now has 267 members ranging from funeral directors to wedding photographers and nurseries to architects, as well as a large number of tradesmen.Local business customers will also now be able to access a fast-track application process to join the BBP.The list of Better Business Partnership members can be found on the council website at pkc.gov.uk/bbp or by calling 01738 476476.Businesses interested in becoming a member of the BBP can also find information about how to join online.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/09/bowman-390x575.jpg ","title":"tannadice game chance for arabs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBids are now being taken for fans wanting the chance to play at Tannadice in Dundee United legend Dave Bowman’s ninth annual charity match to raise funds for skin cancer and dementia charities.The game between fans making successful bids and a team of past tangerine greats takes place on Friday week with a 6.30pm kick-off.This year the fans’ team will be turning out in a special kit in honour of United’s roots as Dundee Hibernian.“This is now the ninth year of these games taking place and there is no doubt I am getting slower,” said Bowman.“The old fire is still burning so nobody better try to beat me on the park.“Seriously, this is always a great evening and a lot of fun and every year it makes me happy that players from all ability levels take part in the game.“It is all about enjoying the game.
